Workers\n","Body Text: Without a vaccine or antiviral therapy for the newly recognized COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing may be the only current means to effectively slow the spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Most states have enacted shelter in place orders to reduce an individual's risk of infection. But, social distancing is not an option for many, including the millions of healthcare workers still providing important and necessary healthcare. According to a recent survey conducted by the Physicians Foundation, doctors in general see an average of 20 patients per day outside of the current epidemic in addition to interactions with their healthcare team. 1 Healthcare providers rely on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of infections from their patients or to other patients. Appropriate PPE has been shown to be effective at reducing transmission of many severe respiratory illnesses by up to 90%. 2, 3 In the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, most spread in the United States has come from community spread. Given healthcare workers cannot always practice social distancing, they are at increased risk of community exposure.\n"," Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n"," Unfortunately, PPE such as procedural masks and N95 respirators are currently in short supply, leading to increased concerns on how to best allocate these precious resources. 4 There is little guidance on when to implement universal masking protocols and when these protocols can be de-escalated as the epidemic wanes. Universal masking protocols are particularly valuable when the disease prevalence is such that the probability of transmission reaches certain thresholds. The objective of our research was to develop a decision-support tool for hospital leadership to understand the community exposure risk for healthcare workers during this rapidly evolving epidemic and allow for guidance around universal masking PPE decisions.\n"," Our methods to estimate the probability of transmission from an asymptomatic communitydwelling patient are based on probability theory. We hypothesized that the probability of transmission is the product of the prevalence of asymptomatic cases in the community (i.e. the risk of contact with an asymptomatic patient) and probability of transmission per contact [i.e.\n"," Pr(Transmission per Contact) = Prevalence asymptomatic * Pr(Transmission)]. We assumed a constant probability of transmission of 5% per contact. This was based on a review of the current research estimating transmission rates to be between 2% and 20%. 5 To account for the rapidly evolving nature of the epidemic, we allowed our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic infections in the community to vary from 0 to 40%.\n"," We then used joint probabilities to extrapolate from our per contact estimate to a daily risk of infection by number of contacts (i.e. 1-[1-Pr(Transmission per Contact)] k , where k=number of daily contacts). Based on prior research, we estimated daily risks for providers seeing between 1 and 30 contacts per day. For the purposes of interpretation, we assume contacts to be in line with Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of \"being within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)\". 6 To provide policy implementation guidance for hospital administrators and healthcare workers, we developed a heatmap graphic of individual daily risk of transmission from an asymptomatic community-dwelling patient depending on the number of contacts per day. We present this information for providers both with and without PPE, assuming an 90% reduction in transmission risk if PPE such as procedural masks or N95 respirators are used.\n"," The results of our analyses are presented in Table 1 . As would be expected, when the prevalence of asymptomatic cases is low, the probability of transmission from an asymptomatic community case is low. For example, we estimate that 1 out of every 500 healthcare workers who are not using PPE and that encounter 20 asymptomatic patients or coworkers per day will contract the infection when the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in the community is less than 250 out of 100,000.\n"," Without the use of PPE or social distancing, there is a 0.05% increase in the probability of transmission from an asymptomatic community infection for every 1% increase in asymptomatic prevalence in the community. In contrast, with PPE use and assuming a 90% reduction in risk of transmission, there is a 0.007% increase in the probability of transmission for every 1% increase in asymptomatic prevalence in the community, thus an 6.8-fold reduction.\n"," Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n"," As of early April 2020, evidence suggests that as many as 50% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, although this estimate is still fluid. 7 Our goal was to develop a tool to help hospital leadership and healthcare providers estimate the daily risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from an asymptomatic community-dwelling patient or coworker. We believe this tool will be of great interest to healthcare providers and hospital leadership as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to develop in our communities. It could be used to inform policy and procedural workflows in the healthcare setting during this and other pandemics.\n"," This decision-support tool can be used as follows. If half of all infections are asymptomatic, then the population prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 is roughly equivalent to the prevalence of known COVID-19 cases in a particular community assuming universal testing is available. As an example, if there are 100 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people (0.1%) in a community, then the estimated prevalence of asymptomatic patients would also be approximately 100 per 100,000 (0.1%). Our tool in Table 1 could then be used to estimate the risk that 1 out of every 1,000 healthcare providers who see 20 patients per day without PPE would contract SARS-CoV-2.\n"," With the use of PPE, this risk would drop to 3 out of every 10,000 providers contracting SARS-CoV-2 from an asymptomatic community-dwelling patient.\n"," One important limitation of our analysis is the inability to account for the unique clustering and networks of contacts among healthcare providers and patients. Our methods assume random mixing with patients from the community who are equally at risk of being asymptomatic. We also do not assume repeated contacts or clustering of contacts which are arguably more common in a healthcare setting. Ultimately, patient-provider and provider-provider interactions in the Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n"," real-world are complex and difficult to model but random mixing has been shown to provide acceptable estimates for epidemics when the number of contacts or probability of transmission is high. 8 Our results likely represent a conservative estimate of the risk of transmission in the healthcare environment. Another limitation of this study is that it assumes each healthcare system would have some estimates of community or seroprevalence available in order to utilize this approach. However, such estimates may be aggregated at different levels and may vary in accuracy.\n"," In summary, this risk prediction tool can be used to help hospital leadership determine when is the best time to recommend increased utilization of PPE, such as institution of universal masking protocols given the prevalence of asymptomatic cases in their community. This approach could also allow for flexibility in modifying such protocols as risk increases or decreases over time.\n"," This information can be used throughout the epidemic to determine when de-escalation of these protocols should begin.\n"," Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, this period has also coincided with the second pandemic wave in these regions, sparking a heated debate about the role of in-person schooling for community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19.\n"," To limit COVID-19 transmission in school settings, existing evidence highlights the importance of maintaining low levels of transmission in the surrounding communities and adopting recommended mitigation strategies such as universal face mask use and hybrid attendance models to limit crowding in classrooms (Honein, Barrios and Brooks, 2021) .\n"," Nonetheless, this evidence refers primarily to settings with low levels of in-person school attendance and varying levels of community transmission.\n"," In Canada, levels of community transmission were low when schools opened in Fall 2020.\n"," On the contrary, back-to-school policies were quite heterogenous, notably with respect to mask mandates and mode of instruction (fully in person / with optional distance learning). Comparing how the second wave of COVID-19 has affected school-aged children and communities in Montréal, Toronto and Calgary during Fall 2020 thus offers an opportunity to understand the association between in-person school attendance and COVID-19 transmission given different mitigation strategies and homogenous levels of pre-existing community transmission.\n"," In this paper, we present data on trends in COVID-19 weekly incidence among schoolaged children 0-19 years old vis-à-vis other age groups during Fall 2020 in Canada's three largest cities: Montréal, Toronto and Calgary.

Nonetheless, prolonged school closures have serious negative implications for children's health and development (Kuhfeld et al. 2020; Hertz and Barrios, 2020; ECDC, 2020; Chanchlani et al., 2020) . For this latter reason, in Fall 2020 in-person schooling and avoiding large-scale school closures have been a priority in Canada as elsewhere.\n"," Return to in-person schooling has sparked a heated debate about how schools can operate safely as the pandemic unfolds. As embedded in the World Health Organization's recommendations, two main conditions need to be satisfied to do so: community transmission of COVID-19 should be maintained at low levels through appropriate policy measures (such as restrictions on indoor gatherings); and recommended mitigation strategies in schools should be in place (WHO, 2020a; 2020b) . These measures include cohorting (keeping students and staff in small groups or \"bubbles\" that do not mix); the universal use of masks; limiting physical presence in classroom in order to reduce crowding; and ensuring adequate and appropriate ventilation.\n"," Large-scale, population-based studies on the role of these conditions for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between school settings and surrounding communities come primarily from the United States (Honein, Barrios and Brooks, 2020) . Notably, given almost universal face mask use and low levels of exclusively in-person schooling (less than 20 percent of school districts), a recent national assessment found that increases in COVID-19 incidence and percentage of positive test results among adults were not preceded by increases in the school-aged population 0-24 years old (US Department of Health and Human Services / Center for Disease Control, 2020). 1 In other terms, levels of COVID-19 transmission in school settings were not a contributing factor of community transmission, but rather reflected it given that recommended mitigation strategies were widely adopted. Similar findings applied to settings with varying levels of pre-existing community transmission (Goldhaber et al., 2020) .\n"," Since only a small proportion of US primary and secondary students attended school exclusively in person during Fall 2020, it is currently unknown how the association between inperson school attendance and COVID-19 transmission varies when different mitigation strategies (notably universal face mask use and distance/hybrid learning) are in place. We shed light on this issue by presenting data on trends in COVID-19 weekly incidence among school-aged children 0-19 years old vis-à-vis other age groups during Fall 2020 in Canada's three largest cities: Montréal, Toronto and Calgary. 2\n"," Although levels of COVID-19 community transmission were low at the beginning of the school year in the three cities considered, back-to-school plans were quite different. Cohorting was the main common element, whereas the mode of instruction and mask mandates differed.\n"," Provincial plans (Toronto) or school boards' plans (Calgary) allowed for distance learning upon parents' request. Montréal followed the only provincial plan in Canada requiring all children to 1 At the higher-education level, in-person instruction at colleges and universities in the United States during Fall 2020 was associated with increased county-level COVID-19 incidence and percentage test positivity. Non-university counties experienced the largest decrease in COVID-19 incidence (US Department of Health and Human Services / Center for Disease Control, 2021). 2 Our methods are summarized in Appendix 1.\n"," All rights reserved.

For Montréal, they were extracted from aggregate counts of COVID-19 cases released in weekly reports by the Direction régionale de santé publique 4 . For Toronto and Calgary, individual-level case report data were available from, respectively, Ontario Health 5 and Alberta Health 6 .\n"," Following a standard methodology (US Department of Health and Human Services / Center for Disease Control, 2020), COVID-19 case data were analyzed to describe trends in weekly incidence of the disease among children, adolescents and young adults (aged 0-19 years) between August 18, 2020 and January 12, 2021. Due to data availability, children and young people could be stratified only in two age groups (0-9 and 10-19 years old), which do not align perfectly with educational groupings (kindergarden, primary and secondary). COVID-19 weekly incidence is expressed as cases per 100,000. Population estimates used in calculating incidence were obtained from Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2020).\n"," At the end of August 2020, weekly reported incidence of COVID-19 was under 30 per 100,000 in Montréal, Toronto and Calgary (see Table 1 ). Public health measures to maintain low levels of community transmission (notably restrictions on mass and social gatherings) were implemented in Montréal and Toronto in early October 2020. As a result, the second wave of COVID-19 hit first and progressed faster in Calgary than in the other two cities, where it picked up speed only in late October. However, Alberta implemented strict public health measures to reduce community transmission in early December 2020 so that, for the week of December 29 to January 4, COVID-19 weekly incidence was 356.9 cases per 100,000 in Montréal, 165.9 cases per 100,000 in Toronto, and 153.5 cases per 100,000 in Calgary.\n"," All rights reserved.

The proportion of confirmed infections under age 20 was higher in Québec than in Alberta, even though this subgroup represents a larger share of the population in the former than the latter case (see Table   1 ). Indeed, the distribution of COVID-19 cases by age in each city at the end of the 2020 Fall term results from the evolution of weekly incidence in different age groups (Figure 1) . In Toronto and Calgary, trends in children and adolescents aged 0-19 years paralleled those among adults. On the contrary, in Montréal increases in incidence among adults 30-49 years old were preceded by increases among school-aged children, especially those aged 10-19 years. These increases were little impacted by the mitigation strategies introduced in schools in early October, which included mask mandates in secondary school classrooms and the interruption of sports and extracurricular activities. 7 Once COVID-19 transmission among 10-19 years old 'spilled over' to 30-49 years old, we observe increases in COVID-19 incidence across all other age groups, resulting in an exponential increase of the overall incidence of the disease. In Montréal, transmission of COVID-19 in school-aged children thus does not seem the consequence of community transmission because, in that case, we would expect an increase in incidence for 10-19 years old at the same rate as the incidence in 30-49 years old, like we observe in Toronto and Calgary. 7 The public health measure introduced in early October that had the greatest impact on COVID-19 weekly incidence was closing of bars and restaurants, which implied a drop in transmission among 20-29 years old.

The case of Calgary underscores the importance of optional distance learning for limiting spillover effects from school-aged children to other age groups. Indeed, in spite of the lack of public health measures to limit community transmission of COVID-19 for most of the Fall semester, in Calgary weekly incidence in 0-19 years has mirrored transmission in other age groups, notably 30-49 years old, like in Toronto. Montréal provides an extreme example of the negative consequences on COVID-19 incidence of not implementing recommended migration strategies when reopening schools, even when public health measures such as gatherings restrictions are in place to maintain low levels of community transmission. Our findings for Montréal are in line with data from the UK Office for National Statistics, which shows that the prevalence of infection among children aged 2-16 years rose above the prevalence for all other age groups before the 2020 Christmas break (Gurdasani et al., 2021) .\n"," In Montréal, it could be argued that trends in COVID-19 incidence among school-aged children may overstate the role of in-person schooling since they might reflect transmission in this age group occurring outside school walls, for instance during sport activities and other social gatherings. This is unlikely to be the case for a number of reasons, however. First, results from an ongoing study on social contacts indicates that, when they reopened in September 2020, schools became the main place of interaction for children and adolescents age 0-19 (INSPQ, 2021) .

Third, in related work, we have identified that Montreal boroughs with the highest incidence of COVID-19 among 0-19 years old are located in health regions with the highest number of schools reporting cases of COVID-19 and the highest number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in these schools (Bignami et al., 2020) . Lastly, Figure 1 shows that, one week after schools closed for the Christmas break (between December 22 and 29), COVID-19 weekly incidence declined among 0-9 and 10-19 years old, while it was still rising exponentially in all other age groups.\n"," Existing studies indicate that schools can operate safely as the pandemic unfolds by adopting appropriate public health measure to maintain low levels of COVID-19 community transmission and recommended mitigation strategies in schools such as universal masking and hybrid learning.\n"," The role of these strategies has been studied at varying levels of community transmission, but at low prevalence of exclusively in-person schooling. Our findings thus complement the available evidence regarding risk for transmission associated with in-person schooling in important ways.\n"," Mandatory in-person schooling without universal mask mandates (which remain limited to children in grade 5 and higher) have contributed to increase community transmission in Montréal.\n"," This has been in spite of partial lockdown measures in place since early October 2020, which include the suspension of school sports programs and tight restrictions on mass, social and indoor gatherings (including dining in restaurants).

First, this is a comparative case study, which is inherently limited to a degree due to the complexity of the variation in mitigation measures at all levels between them. We believe, however, that the comparisons are strong enough to support the inferences drawn here concerning the importance of school mitigation strategies in limiting COVID-19 transmission. This is especially because COVID-19 incidence is likely underestimated in children, especially at younger ages, in part because milder illness and a higher fraction of asymptomatic infections are associated with decreased testing and case finding (Fisman et al., 2021) . The second study limitation is that, since data were not available for Montréal and Calgary, we could not assess trends in test positivity by age. Finally, we could not evaluate trends in COVID-19 incidence among teachers and school staff members, because in Canada cases are not routinely reported by occupations other than health care workers.\n","Score: 3.5235206250192332\n","\n","Title: Exit strategies: optimising feasible surveillance for detection, elimination and ongoing prevention of COVID-19 community transmission\n","Body Text: Following successful implementation of strong containment measures by the community, Australia is now close to the point of eliminating detectable community transmission of COVID-19. We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID-19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated.\n"," We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow-up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population.\n"," Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID-19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22-33 contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests/million population per week using 1/16 pooling of samples.\n"," Screening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system. 2 Background Worldwide, countries are implementing measures to contain COVID-19. Internationally, empirical data demonstrates that all countries that have been able to exert substantive control of the COVID-19 pandemic have implemented strong containment and social distancing, combined with extensive surveillance.1-3 Australia, too, has achieved success with its strong containment measures. Community compliance with such measures, estimated at over 80%4, along with strong border controls and wider testing and management of identified cases and contacts, has meant that case numbers have dropped from a peak of over 450 cases, to less than 21 new cases per day throughout the country as of 17th March 20205.\n"," Once strong containment, social distancing and other measures have been successful in reducing transmission, enhanced surveillance systems are needed which are capable of confirming that transmission has been eliminated from the community, and which can also detect and control early transmission resulting from reintroductions of disease into the community once containment measures begin to be lifted. Some modelling has raised concerns that where measures to control COVID-19 have been successful, there is likely to be a resurgence of community transmission when measures are lifted, and this cannot be contained by surveillance of hospital presentations6. Broader community-based surveillance and contact-tracing is a proven strategy for enabling early detection in infectious disease outbreaks7 and has the potential to address the resurgence demonstrated by modelling that only includes hospital-based case detection. Moreover, testing capacity, as well as case and contact follow up interventions, are continuing to improve internationally, meaning that more sensitive and sophisticated surveillance systems are increasingly possible.8-10\n"," Currently, there is uncertainty on how best to achieve exhaustive identification of all transmission once prevalence is very low or undetectable through current surveillance strategies, and to detect and manage any reintroduction of community transmission once containment has been achieved. The World Health Organization, although recommending surveillance of influenza-like illness and severe respiratory illness, identifies these areas as a knowledge gap in the monitoring of community transmission.2 This lack of evidence hampers control efforts not only because it limits effective management of transmission, but because it contributes to a reluctance to implement strong containment and social distancing, due to fears that such measures would be required for extended periods.11,12 These fears can be addressed by a clear strategy for managing subsequent resurgences of community transmission once such measures are lifted, without the need for reinstitution of strong containment measures.\n"," WHO representatives have stated that ongoing control of COVID-19 following lifting of containment and social distancing measures will require identification and elimination of all transmission chains. 13 Exhaustive detection and elimination of community transmission chains is standard practice in management of high-risk pathogen outbreaks such as Ebola Virus Disease,7,14 and this experience provides useful guidance for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic.1 Although there are factors that contribute to COVID-19 being more difficult to control with such strategies (e.g. higher proportion of asymptomatic disease, shorter serial interval), there are also factors that mean it is more amenable to such measures than infections such as influenza (e.g. longer serial interval), which we have accepted as beyond our current capacity to eliminate.\n"," This study evaluates surveillance options and proposes an efficient, feasible and scalable strategy that will:\n"," (a) provide corroborating evidence that community transmission has been eliminated through strong containment measures when notified cases are declining; (b) identify and manage any early resurgence in transmission once these measures are lifted; (c) address current constraints in surveillance such as limited testing capacity; and (d) identify other response priorities that are critical to enhanced surveillance.\n"," A range of options are assessed, and efficient strategies are recommended, including a summary of the structure and requirements for such a public health surveillance system. Given constraints on testing, we provide a range of scenarios and related testing and follow-up requirements to allow the proposed strategy to be scaled up and tailored to available capacity. This includes assessing test performance for varying COVID-19 prevalence, and assessing the benefits and costs of pooling, a strategy now being implemented in some settings with limited test materials15, 16 . Although increasing the number that can be tested, pooling may decrease sensitivity17, and is of varied efficiency depending on disease prevalence, thus we sought to assess the impact of such considerations.\n"," Based on current and potentially effective surveillance strategies from our rapid review, we compare the following three candidate groups for surveillance:\n"," • Group 1: Patients with pneumonia presenting to hospitals • Group 2: Patients with fever plus cough presenting to primary care (either general practices or specialist fever clinics). Fever and cough is recommended by WHO as a general syndromic surveillance case definition2, and has been reported as commonly occurring symptoms in patients with COVID-1918. We therefore used this as the syndromic case definition for identification of suspected symptomatic disease in the community. • Group 3: Asymptomatic community members who may have a higher level of unprotected exposure to the community e.g. supermarket and delivery workers, transport workers,19 essential service staff living in families with children who attend school, and teachers (if schools are open).\n"," The following were estimated for these three groups:\n"," • The estimated number of cases in the community within the same transmission chain as the detected case at the time the detected case presents. • The sensitivity and efficiency of testing these groups for a range of testing capacities and varying prevalence of non-COVID-19 fever and cough patients in primary care, and for varying prevalence of COVID-19 in sentinel populations. • The feasibility of surveillance both qualitatively and quantitatively, including the system requirements for increasing testing and follow-up in these groups for a population prevalence of COVID-19 of 1/20,000. This prevalence was calculated with the following assumptions: Iceland had the highest level of community-based screening globally as at 23/03/20, and a similar epidemiology to Australia. Their general population overall prevalence is 0.86% (48/5571). Prevalence in health care system testing was 425/4197=10%, with 34% of this travel related. We assumed 0.005% weekly period prevalence in community, which is 1/3 of that, since community transmission in Australia has decreased substantially since this time.\n"," Gains from enhanced community surveillance are estimated for two scenarios:\n"," (1) High levels of transmission, in which surveillance is implemented in a context of limited or no containment measures and therefore the reproductive number is assumed to be 2.2,20 (i.e. the situation if most containment measures are lifted following successful elimination) (2) Low levels of transmission, in which surveillance is conducted following lifting of some containment measures that have reduced transmission, with the reproductive number assumed to consequently rise above one to 1.2.\n"," Estimated cases in the community were calculated using a stochastic SEIR model, assuming a four-day incubation period before symptom onset, with transmission occurring during the final day of this period.

In sensitivity analyses, we considered higher rates of asymptomatic infection, ranging up to 50%.23 As hospital surveillance is currently restricted to cases with pneumonia, we assumed a 7-day delay from symptom onset until presentation at hospital in severe cases,24 while a proportion of mild and moderate cases present to primary care two days after developing symptoms. We assume that cases are only infectious for three days (including one day of pre-symptomatic transmission) to replicate serial intervals of around 4-6 days.24\n"," Sensitivity and efficiency of testing strategies was evaluated using the following assumptions to calculate precision of point prevalence estimates and case detection capacity per million population:\n"," • Random sampling of presentations in each group.\n"," • Online syndromic surveillance data in Australia (FluTracker) provides self-reported prevalence of fever and cough on a weekly basis. From 2019 data,25 we expect a peak population prevalence of cough and fever of 3%, with 2% across much of winter and 1% outside winter. With extensive social distancing measures, prevalence of fever and cough due to all causes may decrease by 40%,26 therefore we also assessed 0.6% non-COVID fever and cough prevalence. • We compared primary care presentation rates of 50% and 100% of patients with fever and cough in the community.\n"," We also assessed overall test performance (negative and positive predictive values and false negative and false positive rates) under a range of prevalence values and test performance in terms of sensitivity and specificty. Benefits of pooling of samples were considered by estimating the number of tests required at a given prevalence. We also assessed the relative benefits compared to costs of pooling if pooling were to result in a reduction in sensitivity by comparing a situation of high test sensitivity and no pooling (and therefore reduced number of patients tested) with a range of lower sensitivities and pooling (and therefore a higher number tested but also a higher number of false negatives). Figure 1 presents the number of infected people in the community within a single transmission chain at the time that there is one case detected by primary care (left) or hospital (right) surveillance, assuming hospital detections are severe cases with pneumonia and 50% of all symptomatic cases present to primary care with cough and fever. Primary care surveillance results in fewer undetected cases in the community to be identified through contact tracing: under the high transmission scenario (reproductive number of 2.2) there are a median of 13 infected people in the community when a severe case is detected at the hospital compared to a median of 5 infected people in the community when there is a detection through primary care. Under the low transmission scenario (reproductive number of 1.2) there are a median of 4 infected people in the community when a severe case is detected at the hospital compared to a median of 3 infected people in the community when there is a detection through primary care. If all symptomatic cases present to primary care, there are just 3 infected people to be traced under high transmission and 2 infected people under low transmission. Conversely if 50% of cases are asymptomatic and only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care, there are a median of 6 infected people in the community when there is a detection through primary care at high transmission, and a median of 3 infected people in the community at low transmission.\n"," Efficiency of testing (a) Fever and cough testing in primary care .

Under the most likely assumptions outside of winter (1% fever and cough prevalence), exhaustive testing of all fever and cough patients would be possible with 10,000 samples per million population per week. If COVID-19 cases represent 0.1-1% of these fever and cough patients, population testing could be achieved with 800-2,200 tests per million population by pooling of samples in batches of 16 (Table 3) .\n"," The above results are primarily influenced by the prevalence of non-COVID-19 fever and cough in the general community. Even at much higher or lower prevalence of COVID-19, the overall conclusions remain the same. The main impact of varied community prevalence is on precision (confidence interval size around prevalence estimate), on absolute numbers of cases missed and on efficiency gains through pooling of tests. However, when all fever and cough patients present and testing is exhaustive, the number of COVID-19 community cases missed by screening remains at 0 whatever the COVID-19 community prevalence.\n"," (b) Testing of asymptomatic groups with high-risk contacts Table 2 assesses the estimated prevalence and number of community cases of COVID-19 missed by screening, given varied testing and prevalence of COVID-19 infection in an asymptomatic sentinel population.

As Table 3 demonstrates, changes in sensitivity do not have marked effects on negative predictive value. However, at higher prevalence, even small changes in the negative predictive value results in substantially more false negatives. Table 4 demonstrates that it is only with very high specificity (99.9%), and relatively high prevalence (>=1%) that most positive tests are true positives. In all other scenarios, most positives are false positives.\n"," We highlight key public health system requirements and factors that may affect capacity to implement enhanced surveillance below:\n"," The fever and cough surveillance strategy provides the opportunity for simple and clear messaging to the community: isolate and get tested if you have fever and cough. This must include all age groups and could be supported with a hotline and community-based support, and draw on the lessons learnt in regards to community engagement from this and current pandemic responses, both internationally and in Australia. (see Discussion for further details)\n"," Where there is limited testing capacity, pooling of samples would reduce the number of tests required per individual to be tested (see Table 3 ). This is now being implemented in some settings.15 This will greatly reduce the need for testing reagents, especially in low prevalence settings. Promising strategies for further enhancing the coverage and feasibility of such testing include self-collection of samples, which has been found to have similar performance to health worker collected samples in initial research on COVID-19 .27\n"," .

Previous studies on influenza have found that self-collection of samples reduced sensitivity (87% sensitivity compared to clinician collected samples).28 As Table 3 demonstrates, even with such a reduction, overall benefits outweigh the costs in terms of false negatives if such reductions in performance are associated with increased testing capacity. Another promising strategy under review is testing of saliva samples, which will both allow self-collection, and also not require equipment such as swabs, which have been another limitation on testing capacity.\n"," For enhanced surveillance to lead to pandemic control, all confirmed cases must be investigated. Contact tracing should be structured based on two groups of contacts: (a) upstream contacts, i.e. those who are the potential source of transmission to the identified case, and (b) downstream contacts, i.e. those likely to have had contact with the case while the case was infectious. Management will vary depending on which type of contact is identified:\n"," (a) Upstream contacts: intensive case finding and testing of these cases, whether symptomatic or not, is important, both with PCR-based testing to identify current infection, and with serology to identify past infection. The model indicates 2 or 3 cases (including the primary case) within the upstream transmission tree once it is detected at primary care with high surveillance (Figures 1  and 2) . Full contact tracing of the entire transmission tree, which would include another 2-3 chains generated by these cases, would thus require around 22-33 contacts traced.29 It is important to note that these contacts could only be identified through upstream contact tracing. (b) Downstream contacts: optimal follow up includes intensive case finding and quarantining of these contacts, with home monitoring (twice daily temperature checks, GPS monitoring of compliance) and PCR testing for active disease once the 14-day quarantine and follow up period concludes to ensure they do not have asymptomatic disease. On average, 11 such contacts per case needing 14 days follow up per week would be expected.29\n"," Although investigation of downstream contacts is part of most surveillance strategies, follow up of upstream contacts is not uniformly undertaken, but is a feature of those settings implementing successful control1,30,31 Investigation of contacts can be supported through training and integration of community volunteer networks into existing surveillance and contact tracing teams. Software may assist considerably in these efforts,18 and, linked to penalties for those found not to be with their phone during random spot checks by authorities, is again an important part of follow up in those settings with effective control.32\n"," Emerging strategies for enhanced surveillance Recent studies have identified a range of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Symptoms such as anosmia and loss of taste appear to be relatively common in those with infection In a recent study based on ongoing community surveillance through online self-report of symptoms, the prevalence of these two symptoms was 59% in those who tested positive for COVID-19, and 19% in those who did not. 33 However, this study did not provide information on the prevalence of anosmia and loss of taste, without fever or cough, in the population testing negative for COVD-19 or in the general population. Once this data is available, it will be possible to assess the feasibility and added value of including anosmia and loss of taste in the surveillance case definitions.\n"," Screening of wastewater for evidence of community transmission is another emerging strategy that is receiving increased attention34 and is another strategy that could provide a useful addition to primary care screening systems. It could also be used to monitor, on an ongoing basis, high risk facilities such as hospitals and aged care facilities in order to identify early transmission in such settings.

This percent target should be reassessed monthly based on sentinel influenza surveillance systems (e.g. Flutracker, plus additional community-based surveys.) Surveillance system performance should also be validated through, for example, random community-based surveillance for unreported fever and cough at household and in general primary care settings. Fever and cough prevalence has decreased due to social distancing, however as these measures are lifted, it would be expected that prevalence will increase, especially if lifting occurring during winter.\n"," o 100% uptake of screening for fever and cough in sentinel surveillance populations, this can be part of the information collected during sentinel follow-up and monthly fever and cough prevalence surveys recommended above. o Community understanding of testing criteria, attitudes towards uptake of screening, practices related to screening, views on feasibility and burden, support services for enabling screening (again, can be included in sentinel surveillance and surveys)\n"," Indicators of successful progress towards elimination of community transmission, given system coverage, uptake and completeness indicators have all been met:\n"," • 100% of newly reported cases are travel related and/ or known contacts of confirmed cases.\n"," • 100% of newly reported cases are tested on day of symptom onset.\n"," • 100% of newly detected cases have been under quarantine from time of exposure event.\n"," • 100% complete follow up of all contacts.

This figure should also be reviewed regularly, and contact case definitions updated based on serosurveys and screening for viral shedding around identified cases, including in high-risk settings (institutional settings, schools, health care facilities).

It shows that testing for infection in primary care patients presenting with cough and fever is an efficient, effective and feasible strategy for the detection and elimination of transmission chains.\n"," Increasing uptake of appropriate testing: Ensuring communities understand the need and value of presenting for screening is the fundamental requirement for successfully achieving and maintaining elimination of COVID-19 community transmission. This has been demonstrated both in countries which have high testing levels and have not seen resurgence despite lifting of containment measure, 36 and in those countries that successful controlled transmission through containment, but are seeing resurgence of community transmission due to limited testing. 37 The fever and cough surveillance strategy provides the opportunity for simple and clear messaging to the community: isolate and get tested if you have fever and cough. In other settings, provision of paid sick leave for those with fever and cough supports compliance of testing and home isolation.1 Strategies for effective community engagement from other pandemics also provide guidance in this regard.7,14 Also of great relevance is the response of the Australian community to date, which has demonstrated a high uptake of highly burdensome containment measures. 4 The community has also demonstrated a high uptake of testing each time testing criteria have been expanded.38 It is reasonable therefore to expect, that with a consistent and coordinated community engagement strategy and interventions that support timely and easy access to testing, uptake will be high.\n"," Reliance on hospital cases to signal transmission has lower sensitivity, with sensitivity decreasing as the reproductive number increases. It also has other disadvantages. Overall, the proportion of symptomatic cases hospitalised with COVID-19 is 20% globally,21 and the true proportion is likely to be lower if asymptomatic cases are included. A focus of increased hygiene, social distancing and containment measures has been on protecting those at most risk of severe disease and hospitalisation such as the elderly, immunocompromised or those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular disease.39,40 If such measures successfully protect vulnerable populations, we would expect to see a substantial decrease in the proportion of cases with severe disease, and therefore the proportion hospitalised. This would further diminish the value of hospitalised disease as an indicator of transmission, as such cases may occur even later or not at all in many transmission chains.\n"," Random testing of sentinel asymptomatic groups is inefficient at most levels of likely prevalence. The level of testing required to be confident of reliably detecting all transmission chains in the community, or obtaining precise estimates useful for policy making, is unlikely to be feasible on an ongoing basis in most settings. As Table 2 demonstrates, at a range of COVID-19 prevalence, and even with very high levels of testing, the majority of cases in the population are missed, and the estimates of prevalence have a comparatively wide range of uncertainly around them. It should also be noted that these results are for cross-sectional testing in the sentinel population, and would need to be repeated on an ongoing basis to constitute an effective surveillance system, entailing a high level of frequent, repeated and large-scale testing. Even if testing capacity were increased to the level at which the entire asymptomatic population could be screened, this could not be feasibly undertaken in a narrow time window. As a result, if there is undetected transmission, there is the potential for disease to move from those not tested to those previously tested negative over the time period in which the screening was underway.\n"," .

Currently, a proportion of all cases identified in Australia are classified as 'unknown' source of exposure.5 As Figure  2 demonstrates, this by definition means their source of exposure is likely to have initiated multiple chains of transmission by the time the downstream case is identified. Widespread testing of all contacts, upstream and downstream, including low risk contacts around such cases, and even geographical/fomite related testing of possible sources of infection is the most effective strategy for filling the gaps in transmission mapping indicated by such cases, and therefore ensuring identification and management of such unrecognised community transmission.\n"," Pooling is efficient, as it considerably increases the coverage of testing. Even if pooling results in a decrease in sensitivity of pooled tests, the overall number of cases in the population missed due to a higher number of false negatives is small compared to the number that would be missed due to not being tested when pooling is not applied. As Table 3 demonstrates, this is the case even if sensitivity following pooling were to drop to 70%, at COVID-19 prevalence ranging from 0.05%-3.If pooled testing is applied in low-prevalence settings with the expectation that sensitivity will be lower, messaging to the public must indicate that some cases may be missed, and that those with symptoms should isolate regardless of test results Table 4 demonstrates, at low prevalence, small changes in specificity result in large changes in the positive predictive value, and therefore most positive tests are false positives. At higher prevalence, the proportion of positive tests that are false positives decrease. Although specificity is considered high (100%) for PCR tests, the gold standard, the impact of reduced specificity is an important consideration when assessing rapid diagnostic tests coming to market. It may be that a contributor to the very high levels of asymptomatic disease reported in some settings may be partly due to lower test specificity, and this should be investigated further.\n"," Expanded testing capacity, low prevalence: Ideally, under these conditions we would expand the case definition for screening. Inclusion of symptoms emerging as useful predictors of early and/or mild disease (e.g. anosmia and loss of taste)33 may increase the sensitivity of the system and allow earlier detection of transmission chains, especially once containment is lifted and the reproductive number for any new cases increases accordingly.\n"," The determining factor in regards to the number of individuals requiring testing is the prevalence of screening case definition symptoms in the general community. As Table 1 demonstrates, this means that at the peak of the influenza season, the testing requirements will increase between three to six fold compared to the non-influenza season. In Australia, peak influenza transmission occurs from late May-early July. In addition, if COVID-19 has a seasonal pattern, and this is likely to be the case considering other respiratory pathogens and similar SARS-CoV viruses,41 any residual transmission that continues into these months is likely to be amplified by seasonal effects. This suggests that given a strategy of strong containment and exhaustive surveillance aimed at elimination of COVID-19 community transmission, investing as much as possible in achieving this before the peak of the influenza season will optimise the value of every investment made in testing, contact tracing and containment.\n"," It is important to note that our study only assessed surveillance and related measures for control of local transmission. One of the main contributors to transmission in Australia, and an important factor in effective control, has been how Australia's borders, both air and sea, have been managed. Hotel quarantining of new international arrivals began on March 28th, 42 and appears to have contributed to the marked reduction in locally acquired disease, although disaggregation of data over time in relation to place of acquisition is not .

An enhanced surveillance system that has achieved elimination of detectable disease from the community is designed to detect and manage early re-introductions or emergence, including travel-related disease. However, continuation of effective border controls once other social distancing and control measures are lifted will reduce the pressure on the surveillance system to identify and manage imported disease and related local transmission once elimination has been achieved and while maintaining a relatively normal return to life within Australia.\n"," The other major challenge to the surveillance system will come from superspreading events. Both during this outbreak and in past, significant outbreaks of other infectious diseases, such events centre around religious or burial activities,43 other large gatherings where contact occurs, and around health facilities and other institutional settings.44 Limiting the size and opportunities for transmission in such settings that are non-essential will be an important part of control. However, health facilities are essential services, and must continue functioning. Measures for heightened general infection prevention and control that cover both staff and patients, and deal not only with disinfection, but with patient and staff flow and which are linked to intensive surveillance, are a critical aspect of ongoing COVID-19 management in such settings even once elimination has been achieved. Such measures can and should also be applied to essential services and settings where there is a high proportion of vulnerable individuals (e.g. aged care), in the latter case not to prevent superspreading events, but to protect those most vulnerable to severe disease.\n"," Australia currently has observed community transmission of COVID-19 in some jurisdictions, while in others, most cases are in or linked to returned travellers. Measures implemented at the end of March 2020 include isolation of cases, border controls, quarantine of contacts and social distancing. These measures have been escalated in some jurisdictions to include closure of schools, universities and non-essential workplaces.29-34 Testing rates are relatively high by international standards,35 and COVID-19 surveillance in some jurisdictions in Australia has moved beyond just testing of high-risk populations (e.g. symptomatic returned travellers and contacts of cases) to inclusion of testing of individuals likely to reflect communitybased transmission (e.g. symptomatic health care workers and patients with pneumonia), and testing of fever and cough as proposed in this paper.45 This provides a foundation on which to bring about greater current pandemic control, as well as a means of detecting early resurgence in the community following successful control.\n"," Given our findings, we recommend exhaustive testing of patients presenting with fever and cough in primary care as the most efficient and feasible means of detecting all community transmission of COVID-19 in high and low transmission settings. This is in addition to current testing regimens such as the testing of symptomatic travellers, contacts, health care workers and hospitalised pneumonia cases. Once community cases are identified, detailed and meticulous upstream and downstream contact tracing, linked to quarantining of all contacts, and both antigen and serological testing of all upstream contacts who may be the source of infection, will support elimination of community transmission, and rapid control if and when reintroductions of disease occur. This strategy optimises the likelihood of remaining in the elimination phase while allowing for ongoing lifting of containment measures. Community engagement in order to ensure high levels of testing uptake and compliance with follow up measures in identified cases and their contacts is critical to successful implementation of this strategy.\n"," .

COVID-19 vaccines are not only extremely effective at preventing severe disease (vaccine efficacy, VE > 90%, [1] ), but they also decrease susceptibility to infection (VE S ) and further decrease rates of onward transmission (VE I ). In spite of these reductions, so-called vaccine breakthrough infections and subsequent transmission have been widely documented [2] , raising the question of how to further mitigate transmission in partially vaccinated populations.\n"," Prior to the approval of COVID-19 vaccines, transmission mitigation via consistent population testing was shown to be an effective approach to break chains of transmission and decrease the burden of COVID-19 using both RT-PCR [3] [4] [5] and rapid antigen testing [5, 6] . Specifically, testing is effective at the community level because it decreases transmission from individuals who are already infected [5, 7] . However, this means that the impact of testing focused only on the unvaccinated population, as has been proposed [8] [9] [10] , may be limited by the extent to which transmission is driven by the unvaccinated population.\n"," Complicating matters further, the role of vaccines in reducing transmission is complex and changing. First, VE S and VE I vary depending on which vaccine was administered [11] . Second, both VE S and VE I wane with time since vaccination [12] [13] [14] , but may also be boosted to higher levels for those receiving an additional dose [15] . Third, those who have experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection also show decreased risks of infection and transmission [11] , not only providing partial protection to those who are unvaccinated and previously infected, but augmenting protection for those who are vaccinated and previously infected [15] . Thus, the relative estimates of risk reductions due to vaccination, prior infection, or both, as well as the sizes of the populations falling into each category of immunity, will affect transmission dynamics-with or without testing.\n"," In this study, we model the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in populations of mixed vaccination status, focusing on two critical questions. First, how do vaccinated and unvaccinated populations each contribute to community spread, and how do those contributions vary with rates of vaccination and prior infection? Second, how do testing programs focused on unvaccinated individuals alone affect community spread? Our study's goals are not to make perfectly calibrated predictions but instead to elucidate more general principles of transmission and unvaccinated-only testing in partially vaccinated populations. As such, our analyses consider a wide range of parameters and scenarios.\n"," High vaccination rates drive total infections down, increase the proportion of breakthrough infections, and shift the drivers of transmission constant rate of exposure, with infection-acquired or vaccine-acquired immunity providing partial protection against subsequent infection. Because precise estimates of the basic reproductive number R 0 vary by context and over time, our analyses consider values inclusive of possible non-pharmaceutical interventions like masking and physical distancing, and thus range from 4 to 6. In our baseline modeling scenario, vaccines were assumed to reduce susceptibility to infection by VE S = 65% and the likelihood of transmission to others by VE I = 35%, values which land within plausible literature estimates for the effectiveness of two doses of mRNA vaccine in the absence of dramatic waning and without boosting [11, 15, 16] . Though less often studied in the literature, we assumed that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection would lead to 63% and 13% decreases in risk of infection and transmission based on a statistical model relating immunity to neutralization [15] , and that hybrid immunity would be superior to either vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. See Materials and Methods and Supplementary Table S1 for a complete description of the model and parameters.\n"," In a modeled population of N = 20, 000 with 58% vaccination rate (corresponding to U.S. estimates as of Nov. 4, 2021 [17] ) and 35% past infection rate, outbreaks still occurred, despite assuming a partially mitigated delta variant (R 0 = 4) and immunity from past infection, vaccination, or both. During the ensuing 3 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review) outbreak, 59% of total infections occurred in unvaccinated individuals, despite making up only 42% of the population (Fig. 1c) , with the remaining 41% of infections occurring among the vaccinated (breakthrough infections). Furthermore, the peak burden of disease occurred first in the unvaccinated community and then one week later in the vaccinated community (Fig. 1b) , a known consequence of disease dynamics in populations with heterogeneous susceptibility and transmissibility [18, 19] . By categorizing transmission events into four distinct modes (Fig 1a) , we observe that infections in both communities were driven predominantly and consistently by the unvaccinated community (U → U , U → V ; Fig. 1d ), but that there was nevertheless some transmission from the vaccinated community (breakthrough transmission). These differences occurred despite a \"well mixed\" modeling assumption-namely, that neither type of individual is more or less likely to associate with a member of their own group vs the other group.\n"," Vaccination and past infection rates vary widely across the U.S. [17] and the world [20] due to impacts of both vaccine availability [20] and refusal [21] , as well as the success or failure of transmission mitigation policies. We therefore asked how a population's vaccination and past infection rates would affect our observations about total infections, breakthrough infections, and the relative impacts of the four modes of transmission. This analysis revealed three important points.\n"," First, our results reinforce the fact that increased vaccination rates lead to decreased total infections, both before and after the herd immunity threshold at R eff = 1 (Fig. 1c) . Moreover, when large proportions of the population are also partially protected by immunity from prior infection, the vaccination levels at which R eff = 1 decrease considerably (Fig. 2a) . For instance, increasing prior infection rates from 35% to 50% decreases the required vaccination rate for R eff = 1 from 87% to 80%. Combinations of immunity from past infection and vaccination thus have the potential to create a herd immunity frontier, beyond which transmission is no longer self-sustaining even in the absence of testing.\n"," Second, as vaccination rates increased, the fraction of infections classified as vaccine breakthroughs increased (Fig. 1c) , creating a transition point such that when 68% of the population was vaccinated, 50% of 4 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review)\n"," The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted December 8, 2021. ;  all infections were breakthrough infections under our baseline modeling conditions. To determine whether this transition point of 68% was sensitive to the precise fraction of the population with immunity from past infection (35%, Fig. 1 ), we varied the fraction with infection-acquired immunity between 0% and 100%, finding that the 50/50 breakthrough infection transition occurred between 63% and 75% vaccine coverage (Fig. 2b) . Thus, our results set the expectation that increasing vaccination rates will decrease total infections, but a higher proportion of those infections will be breakthroughs, irrespective of levels of immunity due to prior infection.\n"," Third, as vaccination rates increased, the unvaccinated community ceased to be the primary driver of transmission. Under our baseline modeling conditions (R 0 = 4, 35% with infection-acquired immunity), this transition occurred when 80% or more of the population was vaccinated (Fig. 1e ). When we varied the fraction of the population with infection-acquired immunity between 0% and 100%, this transition point varied from 76% to 82% (Fig 2c) . Thus, while COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are likely to remain concentrated primarily in unvaccinated populations, only a minority of infections will occur in, or be driven by, the unvaccinated community when vaccine coverage is sufficiently high. Note that this implies that unvaccinated individuals living in highly vaccinated communities will still be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and thus remain at risk of infection.\n"," These findings are driven by reductions in susceptibility and infectiousness arising from vaccination, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or both. However, quantitative estimates of those reductions vary depending on which vaccine was administered [14] , time since vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection [12] [13] [14] , whether an additional \"booster\" dose was given [15] , and the variant circulating at the time of the study [22, 23] . We therefore sought to determine how our findings might change under different sets of assumptions about vaccine effectiveness by comparing our baseline scenario (VE S = 0.65, VE I = 0.35) with a waning/low immunity scenario (VE S = 0.5, VE I = 0.1) and a boosted/high immunity scenario (VE S = 0.8, VE I = 0.6).\n"," To explore the impact of waning and boosted vaccine effectiveness, we simulated outbreaks for all combinations of vaccination and infection-acquired immunity rates under the three VE scenarios. Across simulations, we found that total infections were well predicted by calculating R eff at the start of each simulation. In particular, outbreaks were small when vaccination or past infection rates crossed the herd immunity threshold (R eff < 1). When R eff > 1, total infections monotonically increased as R eff increased (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The herd immunity threshold was impossible to cross with vaccination alone in the waning VE scenario with partially mitigated transmission (R 0 = 4, Waning and boosting assumptions altered the proportions of infections occurring in, and transmission from, the unvaccinated vs vaccinated communities. All else being equal, waning immunity led to increased fractions of breakthrough infections and breakthrough transmission from the vaccinated community, while boosted immunity led to decreases of both. In turn, population vaccination rates at which the majority of infections were breakthroughs shifted down (waning; Fig. 3a ), while vaccination rates at which the majority of transmission was driven by vaccinated individuals shifted up (boosting; Fig. 3c ).\n"," Among the three transition points identified in transmission dynamics, we observe that, in each VE scenario, R eff is driven by both vaccination and past infection rates, as evidenced by curvature in R eff = 1 isoclines (Fig. 3 , black lines). In contrast, isoclines representing the transition points between majorityunvaccinated vs majority-breakthrough infections (Fig. 3 , light green lines) and the transition points between majority-unvaccinated vs majority-breakthrough transmission (Fig. 3 , dark green lines) are relatively 5 .

These findings suggest that the relative proportions of breakthrough infections and breakthrough transmission are driven by vaccination rates and VE, but not by rates of past infection or proximity to herd immunity; indeed, after the herd immunity threshold, both infection and transmission isoclines show essentially no variation. These observations suggest that unvaccinated-only testing programs, which decrease rates of U → U and U → V transmission, may be highly effective only in regimes where transmission is driven by the unvaccinated (i.e. to the \"left\" of dark green isoclines, Fig. 3 ), an intuition we now explore in detail.\n"," To explore the impact of unvaccinated-only testing on population transmission, we modified our simulations so that a positive test would result in an unvaccinated individual isolating to avoid infecting others [5, 24] . We considered test sensitivity equivalent to RT-PCR with a one-day delay between sample collection and diagnosis under two testing paradigms: weekly testing with 99% compliance and weekly testing with 50% compliance-a value which reflects observed compliance with a weekly testing mandate in a university setting [3] .\n"," Our simulations show that the benefits of an unvaccinated-only testing program fall into one of three categories, depending on the population vaccination rate and transmission dynamics. These categories align with three distinct regions in parameter space, denoted in Fig. 4 as regions I, II and III. In region I, testing is insufficient to fully control transmission, yet nevertheless markedly reduces total infections (Fig. 4a) . In region II, testing successfully brings transmission under control (Fig. 4b) . In region III, testing has little impact on transmission due to the fact that outbreaks are already mitigated by population immunity and other control measures (Fig. 4c) . Unvaccinated-only testing is therefore impactful in the first two regions, sufficient for transmission control in only the second region, and largely inconsequential to transmission in the third.\n"," .

Total number of infections with no testing (black) and weekly testing with 99% compliance (pink) are shown for 25% (a), 75% (b), and 95% (c) population vaccination rates. (d) Effective reproductive number over various population vaccination rates, where R eff = 1 is denoted by gray dashed line. Testing's impacts fall into three categories (see text) depending on whether vaccination rate falls into region I, II, or III, as annotated. R 0 = 4 and 35% rate of prior infection with baseline VE and immunity parameters (Materials and Methods, Supplementary Table S1 ).\n"," The three regions that correspond to different impacts of testing are separated by boundaries which can be estimated from two analytical calculations of R eff -one which includes the effects of testing and one which does not. The boundary separating regions I and II is given by those parameters for which R eff = 1 with testing, while the boundary separating regions II and III is given by those parameters for which R eff = 1 without testing (Fig. 4d) . Thus, the value of an unvaccinated-only testing program can be evaluated based on which of three regions the current vaccination rate, prior infection rate, and VE fall into.\n"," To illustrate the value of this R eff -based analysis, we considered vaccination rates and prior infection rates ranging from 0-100% and varied VE between waning, baseline, and boosted scenarios. Across scenarios, dramatic relative reductions in infections are concentrated only within the envelope between the boundaries of R eff = 1 with and without testing, i.e., region II (Fig. 5) . Outside of this effective testing envelope, percent reductions in infections decreased markedly, either because unvaccinated-only testing was an insufficient intervention during a rapidly growing outbreak (region I), or because existing population immunity prevented large outbreaks in the first place (region III). Assuming a 35% past infection rate and R 0 = 4, region III appeared only for baseline and boosted vaccine effectiveness assumptions, and only when vaccination rates were approximately 90% or greater (baseline VE) or 75% or greater (boosted VE). Sensitivity analyses show that increasing R 0 to 6, potentially representing pre-pandemic contact rates and the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, cause region III to shrink further. Thus continued testing for SARS-CoV-2 among the unvaccinated may be of limited value, but only when vaccination rates become sufficiently high.\n"," The role of compliance-the fraction of scheduled tests that are actually taken-can also be clarified by examining the three regions of testing impact. Both the simulations and equations for R eff show that increasing compliance from 50% to 99% causes the lower boundary of the effective testing envelope to shift to lower vaccination and prior infection rates, decreasing the size of region I and increasing the size of region II (Fig. 5) . Moreover, increased testing compliance increases the magnitude of infection reductions within both regions, visible as an intensification of color in the infection reduction heatmaps (Fig. 5) . As a result of these observations, we conclude that, in addition to test sensitivity, frequency, and turnaround time [5] , high participation in testing programs is critical to expanding the impact of unvaccinated-only testing programs. However, we also note that testing compliance had little effect in region III where R eff < 1, a result which 7 .

As a consequence, we observe that in the presence of testing, the vaccination rates at which the unvaccinated cease to drive a majority of transmission decrease by 5 to 15 percentage points (Fig. 6b) , with the largest decreases for 99% compliance testing and waning vaccine effectiveness, and the smallest decreases for 50% compliance testing and boosted vaccine effectiveness. In other words, unvaccinated-only testing programs shrink the regime in which the unvaccinated population drives outbreaks.\n"," In contrast, unvaccinated-only testing programs had little effect on the percentage of infections that were breakthroughs. Instead, majority breakthrough regimes remained primarily dependent on vaccination rates and vaccine effectiveness (Fig. 6a) , with transitions to majority-breakthrough infection regimes beginning at 55 to 67% vaccination rates (waning VE), 63 to 75% vaccination rates (baseline VE) and 83 to 84% vaccination rates (boosted VE). We therefore conclude that unvaccinated only testing programs do not markedly alter the expectations of majority-breakthrough infections at high vaccination levels, particularly if VE is low or waning.\n"," . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review) \n"," In this analysis, we find that in communities with mixed vaccination status, routine SARS-CoV-2 testing programs focused on the unvaccinated community can reduce infection, but in a manner dependent on two conditions. First, effective screening testing requires high participation to be most impactful, reinforcing the need for mechanisms to encourage or enforce high participation. Second, when vaccination and past infection rates are high enough to curtail transmission on their own, testing the remaining unvaccinated population averts few infections in both relative and absolute terms. Thus, targeted unvaccinated testing programs lose effectiveness once vaccination rates exceed the threshold at which population immunity and other interventions push R eff below 1. These results echo related work focused on universal testing programs [7] .\n"," The critical vaccination rates, above which unvaccinated-only testing programs provide little transmission reduction, depend on vaccine effectiveness, rates of infection-acquired immunity, and whether transmission is mitigated by other means such as physical distancing and masking. In particular, our analysis suggests that with boosted vaccine effectiveness (VE S = 80%, VE I = 60%) and 35% past infection rates, unvaccinated-only testing is not needed when vaccination rates exceed 70% with other control measures in place (R 0 = 4) or 85% in their absence (R 0 = 6), with lower thresholds possible as rates of past SARS-CoV-2 infection increase. In contrast, with baseline vaccine effectiveness (VE S = 65%, VE I = 35%) and 35% past infection rates, unvaccinated-only testing is not needed only when 85% or more were vaccinated, and only then with other control measures (R 0 = 4). For waning VE scenarios, practically no vaccination rates existed at which testing could cease. Thus, combinations of vaccination, boosting, masking or other mitigation measures, and past infections may allow some communities to cease testing and reallocate limited public health resources elsewhere (including to further increase vaccination rates), but such combinations are practically nonexistent for pre-pandemic contact rates and waning VE.\n"," .

First, when vaccination rates are sufficiently high, a majority of the albeit reduced number of infections will be vaccine breakthrough infections. This fact should come as no surprise, as this transition must occur at some point for any vaccine below 100% effectiveness; our modeling estimates it to take place between 63% and 75% vaccine coverage (baseline VE; 55-67% vaccinated with waning VE; 83-84% vaccinated with boosted VE). Second, while at low vaccination rates, community spread is driven by the unvaccinated population, at higher vaccination rates, community spread is driven by the vaccinated population (Fig. 3) . These vaccination rate transition points separating majority-unvaccinated transmission and majority-breakthrough transmission are driven lower by unvaccinated-only testing programs (Fig. 6) . Taken together, these results suggest that while the overall number of cases in highly vaccinated communities will be low, vaccine breakthrough infections and transmission events from vaccinated individuals should not be surprising-vaccine effectiveness is not 100%. Consequently, in anticipation of continued community transmission even in highly vaccinated communities, those at increased risk of severe COVID-19 should take additional precautions to limit their risk of infection or severe disease.\n"," Our analyses identify two limitations of testing programs in reducing community transmission. First, for a testing program to be effective, testing must have high rates of compliance; weekly testing with 50% compliance-a rate which reflects observed compliance in a population with a weekly testing mandate [3] is likely to be relatively ineffective. Second, the ability of a testing program to prevent community spread is restricted to a limited \"envelope\" of past infection rate and vaccination rate combinations in which R eff without testing is greater than one, and R eff with testing is less than one. However, it is important to note that while our analyses focus on the benefits of testing in reducing transmission, testing also plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment, detection of variants, situational awareness and surveillance, and decreasing pressure on the healthcare system during outbreaks. Furthermore, testing focused on the unvaccinated population may provide additional incentives to get vaccinated and thus avoid regular testing. Our study did not explore the benefits of unvaccinated-only testing mandates for these additional purposes.\n"," Our analysis is limited in at least three different manners. First, our modeling incorporated fixed parameters that are difficult to estimate in practice. For instance, while our analysis considered boosted, baseline, and waning scenarios for vaccines' reductions in susceptibility VE S and infectiousness VE I based on ranges of estimates in the current literature, few studies are available to guide estimates of similar risk reductions associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, with or without vaccination (but see Refs.\n"," [11] and [15] ). Alternative parameter assumptions may be explored via the provided open-source code. Second, we assumed perfect isolation after receiving a positive test result in all testing regimens, effectively removing all infectiousness once a diagnosis is received. Were this assumption to be violated by imperfect or delayed isolation, we predict a proportional loss of testing impact across all scenarios. Third, our model assumed that vaccination and past infection statuses are uncorrelated at the population level, yet they may be anticorrelated due to the protective effects of vaccination or because those with past infection may choose to forgo subsequent vaccination. We similarly assumed no homophily in contact patterns based on vaccination status, yet those who choose to be vaccinated may be more likely to be situated in a social network with others who choose to be vaccinated, and vice versa [25] . Analyses of simulated communities with homophily by vaccination status only slightly increased vaccination rates at which the key transitions discussed above were observed. Finally, our model assumes values of R 0 and immunity associated with the delta variant, but emerging variants such as omicron (identified a week prior to the present writing) may dramatically shift the values of these parameters. These limitations affect the exact vaccination and past infection rates at which the three transitions identified in our study occur, and thus our analyses describe fundamental phenomena but do not 10 .

Other areas of focus include the allocation of scarce personal protective equipment to reduce transmission [26] , the prioritization of vaccines by subpopulation [27] [28] [29] , proactive testing programs in specific workplace structures [30] or contact networks [7] , immunity \"passport\" programs [24] , or immune shielding strategies [31] . Our contribution to this literature is primarily to show that testing programs focused on the unvaccinated will substantially reduce transmission only with strict adherence, and only until population immunity is sufficiently high as to obviate the need for this form of targeted intervention.\n"," Our analyses are based on a continuous time ordinary differential equation compartmental model with Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) compartments, stratified into vaccinated V and unvaccinated U groups. In addition to tracking infections among these two groups separately, we also tracked infections from both groups separately, enabling us to investigate four modes of transmission: from U to U , from U to V , from V to U , and from V to V . In all simulations, we used a constant total population size of N = 20, 000 and denoted the vaccinated fraction of the population with φ.\n"," To incorporate the possibility that individuals may have experienced prior infections, we further subdivided U and V into SARS-CoV-2 naive and SARS-CoV-2 experienced subpopulations, such that a fraction ψ of each was assumed to be previously infected and 1 − ψ remains naive. For notation, we denote the subpopulations of U to be u (unvaccinated, naive) and x (unvaccinated, experienced/prior infection), and the subpopulations of V to be v (vaccinated, naive) and h (vaccinated, experienced). We assumed that vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 experience statuses were fixed at the start of each simulation and immutable throughout, such that there was no ongoing vaccination, and individuals who were infected and recovered during each simulation were not reassigned to SARS-CoV-2 experienced status [32] .\n"," We denote the protective effects of immunity as XE, VE, HE, expressed as reductions in risk due to prior infection alone (x), vaccination alone (v), or prior infection and vaccination (i.e. so-called \"hybrid\" immunity; h), respectively. Immunity was modeled to (i) decrease the risk of infection upon exposure, and (ii) decrease the risk of transmission upon infection, placing our vaccine and immunity model in the broader category of leaky models [33] . Reductions in the risk of infection upon exposure (XE S , VE S , HE S ) and reductions in the risk of transmission when infected (XE I , VE I , HE I ) were parameterized separately, based on ranges of estimates from the literature. See Table S1 . Due to broad uncertainty in these effects over time since exposure [11, 32] or vaccination [11] [12] [13] , by vaccine manufacturer and schedule [14, 15, 34, 35] , by context [23, 36] , and by variant [15] , our analyses intentionally consider a range of values. We assumed that hybrid immunity would always be superior to either vaccination alone or prior infection alone, via the simple formula HE = (1 − VE)XE + VE. All simulations were run for 270 days, and all individuals were initially in one of the susceptible com- ψ) , and φψ, respectively.

We estimated increased rates of removal using a previously established method that takes into account (i) the calibrated trajectories of viral loads within individual infection [37] , (ii) the relationship between viral load and infectiousness [5] , (iii) the frequency of testing, (iv) the test's analytical sensitivity (i.e. limit of detection) and turnaround time [24] , and (v) testing compliance and valid sample rates, i.e. the fraction of scheduled or mandated tests which actually produce a valid sample [3] . In particular, our adaptation takes a previous model [5, 24] and updates viral load dynamics for the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 [38, 39] , the dominant variant at the time of the present analysis. To incorporate the effectiveness of testing θ, we reduce the duration of infectiousness 1/γ by a factor (1 − θ) . Parameter values for θ are found in Table S1 , and are based on weekly PCR testing with a one-day turnaround, analytical limit of detection of 10 3 RNA copies per ml sample, and compliance rates of 50% (as in [3] ) or 99% (as in [6] ). These values assume that individuals immediately and successfully isolate upon receiving a positive diagnosis. We note that estimated effects of rapid antigen tests (with higher analytical limits of detection, but zero turnaround time) are highly similar to PCR testing under the assumptions above, provided that testing program frequencies and compliance rates are identical [5] .\n"," Inclusive of all effects introduced above, the forces of infection are given by\n"," where i = {x, v, h}, and reductions in susceptibility due to immunity are given by (RR S ) i = {XE S , VE S , HE S }, correspondingly.

However, it is frequently challenging to estimate the effectiveness of prevention measures [6, 7] . Key barriers include the fact that there is generally a low incidence of infections in any one hospital, and therefore individual facilities have little opportunity to quantify the impact of an intervention in a short study. Multicenter studies have been conducted to help address this issue, but their cost can be prohibitive and the length of follow-up can be relatively short [8, 9] . Further complicating the problem, patients transfer between hospitals, nursing homes, other healthcare settings, and the broader community; thus, transmission and symptom onset in non-hospital settings can complicate efforts to evaluate the impacts of hospital-based interventions [7, [10] [11] [12] .\n"," To address such challenges, investigators sometimes use simulations to help assess whether a previous intervention was effective or whether a new intervention is likely to be successful [13, 14] . Transmission models are relatively inexpensive and quick to create, but require additional assumptions compared to traditional epidemiologic approaches (e.g., randomized trials, cohort studies) [15, 16] . Concerningly, even seemingly innocuous assumptions that are introduced to simplify an analysis have the potential to alter results in ways that modelers did not expect. For instance, modelers often simulate asymptomatically colonized individuals as having higher rates of hospital admission [17, 18] or longer lengths of hospital stay [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] compared to uncolonized individuals because they are asymptomatically colonized. While it is true that colonized individuals on average spend more time in hospitals per admission and are more readily admitted, there are likely several confounding factors that can explain the association [36] . For example, people asymptomatically colonized with an HAI causing pathogen tend to be older and sicker than non-carriers [37] . Consequently, a more plausible explanation is that people in poor health are more likely to be hospitalized and to have long lengths of stay, and thereby are more likely to become colonized with a HAI causing pathogen. Reverse causation can also explain some of the crude association between carriage status and length of stay [38] . As a result, transmission models could provide inaccurate estimates of intervention impact when asymptomatic carriage is simulated in these ways. Therefore, our primary aim was to test whether the assumptions regarding higher rates of hospital admission or longer lengths of hospital stay for asymptomatic carriers can affect the results of simulations that evaluate the effects of interventions that work by preventing transmission of HAIs interventions.\n"," We created a deterministic compartmental model with Uncolonized, Colonized (asymptomatic carriers), and Symptomatic disease states to simulate transmission of an HAI pathogen in a hospital and the surrounding community (Fig 1) . For each state, we included separate compartments for each combination of location (hospital or community), carrier type (short or long durations of carriage), and risk group. In our examples, we used two age groups (persons aged 0 to 64 years and adults 65 or older) to define the risk groups since older age is generally recognized as a proxy for increased rates of hospitalization and longer lengths of stay, and agespecific hospitalization data are widely available (Table 1 ) [39] . We parameterized the model so that adults 65 or older spent more time in the hospital than persons aged 0 to 64 years because of their higher admission rates and longer lengths of stay (Table 2 ). Individuals could move between the hospital and community but, to simplify the model, they could not transition between age groups or carrier types. We parameterized the model using data for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, Table 2 , [29, 40] ). Short-term and long-term carrier types were based on the observed heterogeneity in carriage duration for S. aureus [41, 42] .\n"," Transmission could occur between patients in the hospital or between individuals in the community, and the infectiousness of those carrying the pathogen was allowed to differ between the hospital (β 1 ) and community (β 2 ). Colonized and symptomatic individuals in the same location were assumed to be equally infectious (i.e., had the same β 1 or β 2 values). However, contact rates could be assortative by age group, meaning individuals of one age group were more likely to contact members of the same age group than expected if contacts had occurred randomly. The degree of this assortativity could vary by location (δ 1 , δ 2 ). Transmission from adults aged 65 or older in the community was reduced by a proportion (σ) to reflect the fewer overall number of social contacts of older adults compared to younger people [43] . Once colonized, individuals could become symptomatic at a rate α, and this rate could depend on age group and location. Asymptomatic carriers could clear colonization at rate γ a for shortterm carriers, or γ b for long-term carriers. Symptomatic cases returned to the colonized state when they recovered from infection at rate γ S . diagram of the model with compartments for each combination of (i) Uncolonized (U), Colonized (C), or Symptomatic (S); (ii) persons aged 0 to 64 years or adults 65 or older; (iii) shortterm or long-term carrier types; and (iv) subscript denoting location in a hospital (1) or community (2) . Gray arrows show movement between the hospital and community, through admission and discharge, whereas black arrows show transmission, disease progression, recovery from disease, and loss of carriage. Solid and dashed borderlines denote compartments for each age strata, and gray shading denotes the long-term carrier compartments. Individuals could not move between age groups or carrier types. Full model equations are in S1 Appendix. Admission (a) and discharge (r) rates could depend on age group and whether the person was uncolonized, colonized, or symptomatic. Admissions and discharges were balanced to keep hospital and community sizes constant. The lengths of stay in the hospital and rates of admission for colonized, symptomatic, or adults aged 65 or older could be equal to or higher than the rate of admission of uncolonized, persons aged 0 to 64 years according to the following admission rate multipliers: adults aged 65 or older (ρ >65 ), colonized (ρ C ), or symptomatic (ρ S ). These multipliers interacted multiplicatively for individuals with more than one risk \n"," factor for admission (e.g., adults aged 65 or older who were colonized were admitted at a rate ρ >65 � ρ C times that of uncolonized, persons aged 0 to 64 years). We modeled two types of hospital interventions: one that decreased the infectiousness of carriers (hereafter termed \"transmission-based intervention\") and another that increased the rate at which asymptomatic carriers cleared carriage (hereafter termed \"decolonization\"). These interventions can be thought of as simplifications of hand hygiene or use of barrier precautions (transmission-based interventions) and the use of antiseptic bathing and nasal decolonization (decolonization). To simulate the transmission-based intervention, the parameter θ proportionally reduced the infectiousness of asymptomatically colonized and symptomatic carriers in the hospital. The parameters γ int,0-64 and γ int,>65 represented the additional clearance rates due to hospital-based decolonization intervention. We assumed that the duration of symptoms would not be affected by the decolonization intervention.\n"," We used this general model to test the effects of different assumptions regarding asymptomatic carrier admission rates and lengths of stay on estimates of intervention impact. To help a. Transmissibility parameters were fitted using the least-squares method to obtain 3.4% prevalence in the hospital [29] and 1.5% prevalence in the community [40] for each model in the absence of any intervention. b. To calculate the age-assortativity of patient contacts in the hospital using empirical data, we assumed that most transmission is within wards, and that children 0 to 17 years old and women giving birth would not mix with the adults aged 65 years and older. Using these assumptions, age-stratified national data on the total annual number of patient days from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) 2012 [39] and childbirth stay data from [50] , we estimated that 40% of contacts that adults aged 65 years and older have in the hospital would be with persons aged 0 to 64 years old, whereas this fraction would be 61% if contacts occurred randomly between age groups. We adjusted δ 1 until the percentage of contacts within and between age groups in the hospital matched our estimates.\n"," c. Using symmetric contact matrices and all of the European survey data from POLYMOD [48] , we calculated the proportion of individuals in each age group and the fraction of contacts within and between age groups. We adjusted δ 2 so that the percentage of contacts by age group matched the POLYMOD data.\n"," d. We adjusted discharge rates for the Age Group model so that the mean length of stay was kept at 4.5 days in line with the other models. For example, we used adults aged 65 years and older length of stay and total number of stays for from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) 2012 data [39] . 34.8% of discharges in HCUP were in the adults aged 65 years and older age group and this group had a mean LOS of 5.2 days. Therefore, we calculated that the persons aged 0 to 64 years old group must have a mean LOS of 4.13 days to produce an overall reported mean LOS of 4.5 days across both age groups.\n"," e. In the Colonized LOS and Colonized Admission + LOS models, we assumed that the length of stay for asymptomatically colonized individuals was 1 day longer than that of uncolonized individuals. The length of stay for uncolonized individuals was adjusted to maintain a mean length of stay across all patients of 4.5 days.\n"," f. We balanced the total number of admissions and discharges in order to keep the number of hospital patients constant. To do this, we calculated the persons aged 0 to 64 years old's admission rate by dividing the number of daily hospital discharges by the community census, where the community census was the sum of all people in the community weighted by the values of the admission rate multipliers for adults aged 65 years and older, asymptomatic carriers, or symptomatic individuals relative to uncolonized persons 0 to 64 years old (ρ >65 , ρ C , and ρ S respectively). We then multiplied the admission rate for uncolonized persons 0 to 64 years old by the relevant admission rate multipliers to calculate the admission rates for the other groups. g. After setting the length of stays for the Age Group model, ρ >65 was increased until the percentage of admissions that were adults aged 65 years and older in the simulations matched the estimate from national data of 34.8% of admissions being adults aged 65 years and older [39] .\n"," h. For example, an effectiveness value of 30% is consistent with a combined coverage of 50% and efficacy of 60% or coverage of 75% and efficacy of 40%.\n"," https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264344.t002\n"," motivate the problem, we can consider the following hypothetical scenario. Suppose there are limited data suggesting a particular HAI intervention has been effective during outbreaks, but it has not been studied in endemic settings. Consequently, researchers want to assess the possible impact of the intervention in hospitals where the pathogen is endemic in order to inform decisions about the likely generalizability of empirical results. Ideally, the simulation should meet some basic criteria in order for the example to be plausible (e.g., the simulated prevalence of the pathogen in the hospital and community should match data from well-designed, largescale screening studies). However, there are many different ways to make the simulation fit the observed data, and certain approaches could potentially skew results. Of particular concern are common modeling assumptions that asymptomatic carriers have higher rates of hospital admission or longer lengths of stay precisely because they are asymptomatically colonized, which have no biological basis. We analyzed a set of models to help inform modeling decisions in such a scenario. We first devised parameter values to create five sub-models for comparison ( Table 2 ). (1) Age Group model: we stratified the population into two age strata: persons 0 to 64 years old and adults aged 65 years and older, where older individuals had higher admission rates and longer lengths of stay in the hospital. No other model stratified the population into age groups. In the next three models, asymptomatically colonized individuals had (2) higher admission rates (Colonized Admission model), (3) longer length of stays (Colonized LOS model), or (4) both higher admission rates and longer lengths of stays (Colonized Admission + LOS model) compared to uncolonized individuals. We used the Age Group model as our base model against which we compared other model variants. Our main focus was on comparing Models 1-4. We also included a fifth model because of its widespread use (5) Homogeneous Carriage model: we assumed there were no differences in the average duration of carriage across the population. The average duration of carriage for the Homogeneous Carriage model was calculated as a weighted average of the mean durations of colonization used in the other models.\n"," For each model, we fitted the hospital and community transmissibility parameters using the least-squares method to obtain 3.4% MRSA prevalence in the hospital and 1.5% prevalence in the community in the absence of interventions. Then, we ran the model to equilibrium and introduced either the transmission-based intervention, decolonization, or both. For each model, we compared the reproduction numbers (R) and percent of symptomatic cases averted by the interventions. We calculated the number of symptomatic cases averted by subtracting the number of symptomatic cases in a specific model with an intervention from the number of symptomatic cases for the same model without an intervention.\n"," A reproduction number (R) quantifies the spread of a pathogen in a population. We used the next-generation matrix method to calculate R [51] , though we note that the reproduction numbers provided here do not have a standard R 0 interpretation [52] . In addition to an overall R, we also calculated reproduction numbers that included only hospital transmission (R hosp ) by setting community transmission to zero (i.e., β 2 = 0). We similarly calculated a community reproduction number (R comm ) for each model. Separate reproduction numbers for hospital and community transmission are commonly reported in the literature [12, [53] [54] [55] and help compare transmission dynamics in each setting.\n"," We also examined the effects of assumptions about colonized length of stay (r C ) and colonized admission rate (ρ C ) by manipulating the parameter ranges within a single model structure (Age group model). We divided each of the two multiplier parameters into ranges of values from 1 to 3, and then created combinations of each parameter value. For every combination of the two parameters, we used least squares to fit the hospital (β 1 ) and community (β 2 ) transmission rates to obtain 3.4% prevalence in the hospital [29] and 1.5% prevalence in the community [40] for each model in the absence of any intervention.\n"," We then applied a transmission-based or decolonization intervention and calculated the number of symptomatic cases averted by each intervention. For each set of parameter values, we compared the number of cases averted to a base case when the multipliers were set to one (r C = ρ C = 1). This base case either represented the Age group model or the Homogeneous model; in both models, asymptomatic carriers have the same admission rate and length of stay as uncolonized individuals of the same age. We calculated the percent change in cases averted as the percentage of cases averted with multipliers equal to 1 minus the percentage of cases averted with multipliers equal to \"x\", scaled by the percentage of cases averted with multipliers equal to 1. We visualized the results with a contoured heatmap and assessed differences across assumptions and treatments.\n"," We used R (version 3.5.0) to create and analyze the model [56] .\n"," In the pre-intervention period, the equilibrium prevalence of MRSA was 3.4% in the hospital and 1.5% in the community across all five models ( Table 3 ). The admission prevalence was approximately 1.5% for the Age Group, Homogeneous, and Colonized LOS models, whereas admission prevalence was 1.96% for both models that assumed that colonized individuals were more likely to be admitted to the hospital than uncolonized individuals (i.e., Colonized Admission, Colonized Admission + LOS). The rate of carriage acquisition in the hospital ranged from 2.33/1,000 uncolonized patient-days (Colonized Admission + LOS model) to 4.79/1,000 uncolonized patient-days (Age Group model). As expected, the Homogeneous model had the lowest R (1.021), while R was 1.046 for all other models ( Table 3 ). The effect of the different model assumptions on the estimated impact of a hospital intervention depended on the type of intervention (Fig 2, Table 3 ). In the absence of any interventions, 8,223 cases occurred over 5 years in each model. For the transmission-based intervention, the percentage of symptomatic cases averted was highest for the Homogeneous Model, followed by the following models in order: Age Group, Colonized Admission, Colonized LOS, and Colonized Admission + LOS. (Fig 2A) . The differences in intervention impact between the models occurred across a wide range of transmission-based intervention effectiveness values (Fig 2) .\n"," For the decolonization intervention, the percent of symptomatic cases averted was again largest for the Homogeneous Carriage model, but was similar across the other models until the rate of decolonization became high (Fig 2B, Table 3 ). Results for scenarios where both interventions were applied concomitantly were in line with findings for each intervention applied separately (S1 Fig). \n"," All else being equal, including assumptions where asymptomatically colonized individuals had increased length of stay or admission rates because of their colonization status heavily affected estimates of the impact of a transmission-based intervention but had modest effects for a decolonization intervention (Fig 3) . Both multipliers had similarly strong effects for the transmission-based intervention. However, the length of stay multiplier (r C ) had a stronger relative impact than the admission rate multiplier for the decolonization intervention. Higher values of length of stay multiplier or colonized admission rates generally led to greater differences in the number of cases averted. However, when using the homogeneous model as the baseline case, results were more consistent across treatment types (S2 Fig). \n"," We showed that assuming asymptomatic carriers have higher rates of hospital admission or longer lengths of stay can bias simulations of the impact of hospital-based HAI interventions designed to prevent spread of healthcare-associated pathogens, especially for transmissionbased interventions (e.g., enhanced infection control efforts). These assumptions are typically included as if asymptomatic carriers had more healthcare exposure precisely because they were asymptomatically colonized [17] [18] [19] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . However, confounding and reverse causation are more likely explanations for observed differences in admission rates and lengths of stay [36] .\n"," In our main example (Fig 2) , the carrier assumptions produced larger differences across models in the impact of a transmission-based intervention than for a decolonization a. The parameters used in these simulations are listed in the models' respective columns in Table 2 . b. Percent of colonized patients decolonized before discharge is the probability that a colonized individual in the hospital reverted to being uncolonized before being discharged because of the decolonization intervention. For the Age Group model, the discharge rate was weighted by the relative proportions of persons aged 0 to 64 years old and adults aged 65 years and older in the hospital. c. We combined hospital and community cases in calculations of the percent of symptomatic cases averted.\n"," https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264344.t003 Table 2 for parameter values used for each model.

Colors and contour lines denote the percentage change in cases averted compared to the base case. For each combination of values for the r C and ρ C multipliers, the transmission parameters were refit to achieve an equilibrium prevalence of 3.4% colonized individuals in the hospital and 1.5% in the community. We ran models to equilibrium and then implemented a decolonization intervention (γ int = 0.035) or a transmission-based intervention (θ = 30%).\n"," https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264344.g003\n"," intervention. Compared to the Age Group model, fewer cases were predicted to be averted by a transmission-based intervention for models where colonized individuals had longer lengths of stay or higher admission rates. The most likely explanation is that when we assumed higher admission rates or longer lengths of stay for colonized individuals, then hospital transmissibility did not need to be as high to reach the same equilibrium hospital prevalence compared to the Age Group model, and therefore the community became relatively more important for pathogen transmission. In other words, the transmission-based intervention, which proportionally reduced transmissibility in the hospital (β 1 ), prevented fewer transmissions in the Colonized Admission, Colonized LOS, and Colonized Admission + LOS models than in the Age Group model because the latter had the highest value of β 1 to begin with, the highest R hosp value, and therefore the largest contribution of hospital transmission to the overall R value. In contrast, assuming homogeneous lengths of carriage resulted in much higher numbers of transmissions and cases averted than in the Age Group model because the Homogeneous Carriage model had a lower R and transmission in the Homogeneous Carriage model was even more heavily weighted towards transmission in the hospital. On the other hand, decolonization treatments had smaller differences across models, possibly because the number of colonized individuals in the hospital was always the same so only a certain number could be decolonized. For combinations of decolonization and transmission-based interventions, comparisons across models could give similar results depending on the value of each intervention parameter (S1 Fig) .\n"," A potentially valid reason for parameterizing higher admission rates or longer lengths of stay for individuals in model compartments containing asymptomatic carriers is when symptomatic and colonized individuals are pooled together. In this case, the combined compartments could be parameterized using the weighted average of parameter values for colonized and symptomatic individuals [57] . However, such averaged parameter values would need to change in response to an intervention that affected the ratio of asymptomatic versus symptomatic carriers, and it could be difficult to calculate what the new ratio and parameter values should be without representing asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers separately. As with analyses that use standard statistical models (e.g., case-control studies analyzed with logistic regression), we recommend that the choice of which variables to include in a transmission model should be guided by the research question as well as subject matter considerations [58] .\n"," Additionally, we assessed the influence of these assumptions over a range of potential values. In general, the stronger the assumption about asymptomatically colonized individuals and their propensity to stay in the hospital, the more one might miscalculate the impact of an intervention. In our simulations, even small changes in the multipliers led to substantial differences in the model results. However, the type of intervention is still important: we observed different results for an intervention to reduce transmission compared to an intervention that decolonized patients, likely because decolonization acts more through recovery and transmissionbased interventions directly reduces transmissibility.\n"," Our analyses have several limitations. For example, we omitted antibiotics, competition from other pathogen strains (e.g methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or species (e.g. Clostridioides difficile), and impact of patient transfers to or from additional healthcare facilities healthcare facilities, each of which could have affected the magnitude of our results. However, we expect that the same issues would remain if such factors were included because assuming that asymptomatic carriers are more likely to be admitted to hospital or have longer lengths of stay would still have no biological basis and would continue to artificially inflate pathogen prevalence in the hospital compared to a more appropriately structured model (e.g., finer age stratification, higher admission rates for recently discharged patients or nursing home residents). We also expect similar problems to occur if pathogen incidence data were used for fitting instead of prevalence data. Lastly, including higher rates of hospitalization and longer lengths of stay for individuals recently discharged from hospital compared to those who have not been hospitalized recently would have improved the accuracy of the model. However, such model complexity was not required to illustrate the problem, and therefore doing so would have made our example more difficult without clearly providing a commensurate benefit. In future work, it could be useful to include such additional complexity and assess how well different models can simultaneously fit contemporaneous estimates of community prevalence, admission prevalence, hospital prevalence, and/or hospital incidence, which could also help discriminate between simulations in addition to using subject matter knowledge to guide modeling decisions.\n"," In our Age Group model, we stratified the population into groups of younger and older individuals, and each age group had different admission rates and lengths of stay. However, we do not expect that this would result in the same problems as including changes in admission rates and lengths of stay being a direct consequence of being an asymptomatic carrier. Age is a proxy for factors that more directly affect admission rates and lengths of stay (e.g., being diagnosed with a health condition, insurance status). Such factors are unlikely to change concurrently with the gain and loss of colonization, especially after having included additional states in the model (e.g., hospitalization, which is correlated with health status and the risk of acquiring a pathogen), and there are no interventions that affect date of birth. Therefore, we believe that the Age Group model is more realistic compared to the other models and it was useful as a simple base case against which to compare the other modeling assumptions. Building on this framework, additional risk groups could be considered for inclusion as necessary. For example, male gender, recent hospitalization, and residence in a nursing home are risk factors for S. aureus colonization and bacteremia due to an S. aureus infection [59] [60] [61] [62] , and each could be considered for inclusion as additional risk groups.\n"," A simple model cannot capture every possible factor, but our simplified model helped illustrate the central problem associated with attributing different admission rates or lengths of stay to asymptomatic carriers without a clear biological basis for doing so. Our results show that such assumptions can greatly affect estimates of the impact of interventions, and therefore should be justified. We have included our model code, which can be adapted to represent other HAI pathogens and risk groups by changing parameter values or adapting the model structure. While the pathogen parameters in our main example were based on MRSA, our conclusions are broadly applicable because assuming that asymptomatic carriers are more likely to be admitted to hospital or have longer lengths of stay generally have no biological basis.\n"," It is important to assess how modeling assumptions influence estimates of intervention impact. We have shown that common assumptions regarding how colonized individuals are included in simulations can heavily bias estimates of the impact of transmission interruption and to a lesser extent decolonization interventions. Modelers ought to consider whether data in favor of such assumptions could also be biased, how including such assumptions can affect model results, and if a more complex model (e.g., that includes �1 risk factor) is necessary to address specific research aims. Decision-makers should also critically evaluate the biological assumptions underpinning parameter values used in models that inform policy. \n","Score: 3.475072519551564\n","\n","Title: The contribution of stigma to the transmission and treatment of tuberculosis in a hyperendemic indigenous population in Brazil\n","Body Text: these territories is almost exclusively of Guarani-Kaiowá ethnicity. The study took place in four indigenous territories in the catchment area of Amambai; Amambai (population: 8610), Limão Verde (population: 1810), Taquapery (population: 3466), and Guassuty (population: 669).\n"," Based on previous fieldwork observations, we developed two interview guides for assessing perceptions of TB transmission and understanding stigma from different levels and from the viewpoints of patients, relatives, and community members. One interview guide was developed for TB patients (TB Cases, TBCs), (S1 Appendix), and another for Community Members (CMs) who had not had TB, (S2 Appendix). In collaboration with the organization Young Indigenous in Action (Portuguese acronym JIGA) in Amambai, the interview guides were tested and revised to ensure that the questions were appropriate, culturally sensitive and formulated using a Guarani-Kaiowá way of expression to avoid that the essence of the questions would be lost in translation from Portuguese to Guarani.\n"," Six (n = 3 male, n = 3 female) Guarani-Kaiowá research assistants from the JIGA group received training during the week prior to data collection in the form of a series of work group sessions, led by IVK, LP, and AB, where the best translations of the questions, methods of approaching interview participants, interview techniques, the concept of informed consent, and transcription and translation were discussed and agreed upon. All six research assistants were university graduate students aged 19-23 years, and were familiar with the overall research project \"Social Inequalities and TB: Transmission Dynamics, Living Conditions and Interfaces between Biomedicine and Traditional Indigenous Medicine\" [14] from participation in previous fieldwork as interpreters and focus group moderators. The research assistants played a key role as ''ambassadors\" in the community, making introductions and interpreting when interview participants preferred speaking in Guarani.\n"," TB patients (TBCs) who had been treated for TB during the period January 2014-May 2016 were identified from the Amambai district registry, working backwards from the most recent cases. Mindful of close Guarani-Kaiowá family structures, we did not insist on strictly individual interviews if the participant wanted to be interviewed with family members present. Adult members of TB patients' households present at the interview were invited to participate (TB Patient Relatives, TBRs), and were interviewed using the same interview guide as the CMs. CMs were selected by snowball sampling and matched by gender and indigenous territory of residence. The semi-structured interviews took place in the home of the interview participant and were conducted in Guarani or Portuguese depending on the interviewee's preference. For interviews conducted in Guarani, LP, AB, or a research assistant would ask the questions and act as simultaneous interpreter to IVK. Respecting traditional gender divisions, the researchers IVK, LP, and AB were accompanied by gender-specific research assistants. All interviews were audio-recorded. Data saturation was reached when no new comments were appearing in the interviews, as described by Fusch & Ness [18] .\n"," Audio-recorded data, transcribed and translated from Guarani to Portuguese (where necessary) by the research assistants under the supervision of LP and AB, were analyzed using framework analysis. After an initial review of the interviews and field notes by all authors, IVK, IMC, and PCB separately coded passages of interest in the interviews. IVK drafted the first thematic framework which was compared with the coding of IMC and PCB. We generally highlighted the same passages but discussed the coding labels relating to the sources/actors in anticipated stigma until consensus was reached. The draft framework was then discussed with the JIGA group to minimize bias by balancing views from inside and outside the community. Using the finalized thematic framework, IVK undertook the coding using NVivo (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia) software and drafted the first analysis of the passages for each theme for revision by the other authors (S3 Appendix). Citations from the interviews in this text were translated from Portuguese to English by IVK and revised by the other authors.\n"," Throughout the text findings are presented according to the following scale of representation of interviewees: few, <20%; some, 20-40%; many, 40-60%; most,60-80%; nearly all, 80-100%.\n"," This study is part of the project \"Social Inequalities and Tuberculosis: Transmission Dynamics, Living Conditions and Interfaces between Biomedicine and Traditional Indigenous Medicine\", approved by the Research Ethics Committees at the National School of Public Health at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) (#15988913.9.0000.5240/354.060), and the Ministry of Health (#15988913.9.0000.5240/650.820). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants who did not speak Portuguese would have the consent form orally translated and explained in Guarani. Participants unable to read and write would have the form read to them by a relative or one of the Guarani-Kaiowá research assistants and sign with a fingerprint. No honorarium was offered for the interview.\n"," The interviews were carried out in June 2016. Data were saturated with 53 interviews, with a mean length of 54 minutes. Four male CMs from the Guassuty indigenous territory declined to interview as they were on their way to another location. In five households of TB patients, other family members were at home but did not come out to meet us. We interviewed 19 TBCs, 11 TBRs (from 11 different households), and 23 CMs, Table 1 . It was our experience that the presence of family members made for richer interviews as participants felt more at ease talking to us. No stigmatization within the household was reported in households where both a TBC and a TBR were interviewed.\n"," We present qualitative findings according to the standardized TB stigma categories developed by the Challenge TB Stigma Measurement Guidance [19] : a) community/public stigma; negative attitudes to TB in the community, b) anticipated stigma; the expectation and/or fear of being stigmatized, adopting behavioral changes, c) experienced/enacted stigma; concrete experiences of exclusion/discrimination, seen either from the viewpoint of the stigmatized (experienced stigma) or the stigmatizer (enacted stigma), d) internalized or self-stigma; changes in self-perception, loss of self-esteem and/or feelings of guilt or shame as the individual has come to adopt negative stereotypes, and e) secondary stigma; stigmatization by association with a TB patient. Relatives (TBRs) 6 5 11 Community members (CMs) 11 12 23 Perceptions of TB transmission Further, many participants reported that living in dirty, dusty, and/or bug-infested environments increased the risk of TB; ''Many of our women do not take care of their houses. They leave everything dirty-they do not clean around the house. TB comes more quickly when things are dirty\" (CM8). Contact with dirty hands or with contaminated utensils such as spoons, plates, and cups was believed by many CMs to cause TB: ''This disease is really infectious. It spreads via spoons\" (CM9). Few TBCs and TBRs expressed this view. Some participants referred to the working conditions on the sugarcane plantations which involve exposure to dust and ashes: ''I worked on the sugarcane plantation, burning the cane [to facilitate the harvest]. There were a lot of ashes and that stuck in my lungs\" (TBC10).\n"," Many participants expressed beliefs of TB transmission rooted in traditional Guarani-Kaiowá concepts of disease as an imbalance between body and soul, leaving an opening for evil spirits to bring in disease. Being afraid of the disease, or of contact with a TB patient, can be a weak spot through which the spirit of the disease can enter: ''If you look at the body of a person who died and had TB, and you are afraid, then the disease will come to you\" (CM4). Some participants reported that diseases or witchcraft may be in the air at certain times, during which it is recommended to stay indoors to avoid TB: 'My daughter told me ''be careful when you go outside because the diseases are around right now\"\"(TBC2).\n"," A few participants saw TB as a result of accidents or violence where the disease enters the body through injuries: ''Her ex-husband gave it [TB] to her. He raped her and put a bottle up her vagina and left her for dead. He put the disease inside her\" (TBR2).\n"," Most CMs expressed views that a TB patient must be socially isolated while on treatment, with many believing that this isolation must include the entire household of the TB patient. ''When one has TB, obviously everybody in that house should be treated and keep a distance so they do not spread it to others\"(CM9). Most CMs stressed that a person with TB contaminates cutlery and plates; ''If I have TB and I eat, and somebody else eats from that plate, then he already gets it (CM16). Many CMs thought that the isolation could be lifted when the infected person had completed treatment.\n"," Describing how people with TB symptoms would delay seeking treatment, many CMs condemned them for putting others at risk: ''They go to the doctor only after somebody looks at that person and sees that he or she is very thin and asks if they feel any pain, and even then they will say no. I think it is lack of respect, because that person must know that the disease is attacking him or her\" (CM12). Many CMs also perceived people with tuberculosis as unable or unwilling to take care of themselves, thus letting the disease progress and subsequently transmitting it to others: ''It is not like I want to abandon my friend if he has TB, but there is also a part where you need to make an effort and go to the doctor and take care of yourself, because that disease is passed on from one to another\" (CM20). This perceived lack of willingness to take control of the disease was stated as the reason for isolating oneself from people with TB, thus holding the patient accountable for infecting others; ''In the sugarcane plantations there is already a lot [of TB]. But it is here in the village that you get it because these people do not take care of themselves\" (CM9).\n"," Anticipating rejection, most TBCs related that they only told the nearest family and the community healthcare agent about their TB diagnosis; \"After I got TB, I did not leave the house anymore. That way no one would find out. Only the nurses knew about it\" (TBC18). Anticipating ostracization from the community, some TBCs related not going to the healthcare station for a consultation as they did not want to be seen receiving the directly observed treatment in front of their house every day.\n"," Most male TBCs, employed by the sugarcane plantations in the regions on fixed-term contracts when they felt the first symptoms, would try to hide their illness until the end of the contract, sometimes for several months, as they did not want to be sent home and lose the work: ''I was on the sugarcane plantation and I was feeling ill for a long time. I could work only a little before I could no longer breathe. For 6 months I worked like that. One day I had to sit down, and the foreman saw me. He took me to the hospital, and they told my wife that I had died\" (TBC18).\n"," Most TBCs related one or more concrete experiences of stigmatization. Where TB was discovered while the TBC was working on a sugarcane plantation, the response varied considerably by plantation. Some TBCs related being sent back to work after a superficial examination at the workplace, some were sent home, a few were taken to the healthcare service, and a yet another few reported receiving an examination by an external healthcare provider.\n"," While a few TBCs said that a worker could come back to work after having TB, some TBCs related personal difficulties with finding employment after having completed TB treatment as employers were uninterested in workers with a history of TB and could afford to turn them down as the supply of workers was much greater than the demand. ''After I was cured, I lived like this. The company did not want to hire me. Because I was very thin, they did not trust me. ''You will not be able to stand it\", they said\" (TBC11). Some participants reported that they were no longer able to perform the physically demanding manual labor after having had TB and had not returned to work.\n"," Being abandoned by the family was reported by a few TBCs: \"After I got this TB, they [exwife and children] no longer wanted to stay with me\" (TBC14). However, most TBCs experienced practical and emotional support from their immediate family members during treatment. This support was commonly seen as vital for the patient's recovery but also as carrying great personal risk of infection for the family members. Support was extended only to close family members and/or within the household: ''Only my daughter would come, and she would eat and drink tererê [iced yerba-mate drunk from a shared gourd] with me. She would also let the grandchildren drink tererê with me\" (TBC13). Some interviews with CMs corroborated that point: ''If a relative of mine has TB I will avoid them. If we do not live together, I do not know if he or she is doing the treatment\" (CM18). Experiences of avoidance and exclusion by family living in other households and by the community were not receiving visits, friends and family not allowing their children to visit, being the victim of gossip, and not being invited to share a tererê. One man described an episode of feeling rejected by his family living in another village: ''I went to my mother's house (. . .) even she did not want to drink tererê with me because she was afraid she would pass on the disease to my brothers\" (TBC16).\n"," Separating plates, mugs, and cutlery for TB patients is not part of the Brazilian tuberculosis control guidelines [20], but many TBCs described how staff from the healthcare service had handed out special utensils and recommended that the patient sleep and eat alone, thus unnecessarily contributing to the stigmatization of tuberculosis: ''they prohibited me from drinking tererê with friends who are in good health. I ate lunch alone. I had to have a separate plate, separate spoon, and my cup had to be separate\"(TBC2); ''They told me I had to wear a mask. I wore the mask at home. I did not want to leave the house wearing that\"(TBC12). Some CMs related how they had employed this infection control measure with relatives with TB; ''Yesterday we told her that we would not eat together with them (..) Just by using the same spoon the disease spreads, and if you or your spouse has it, it will pass on to others who do not have it\" (CM17). We described under perceptions of TB transmission that many CMs, but only few TBCs and TBRs, believed that TB is transmitted through contaminated/unclean cutlery and plates.\n"," Religious communities (traditional Guarani-Kaiowá prayer houses or evangelical churches) play a central role in the social life in the territories. For some TBCs, they offered a place of acceptance and support, based on the belief that faith would help cure the patient and prevent transmission to the congregation:\"They prayed for me. They were not afraid. It [TB] will not even be passed on, they said\"(TBC3). However, some TBCs experienced exclusion from their religious community: ''After she got TB, she stopped singing in the house of prayers. They were afraid it would spread to the others\"(CM1).\n"," As in the CM interviews, many TBCs reported that the stigmatization commonly lasted only until the completion of treatment after which social relations resumed. However, a few TBCs related that TB-associated stigma persisted even after the completion of treatment: \"Some people are afraid of me and when I arrive, they will not drink tererê with me. I know they know I had TB and they are afraid of getting it. It is still like this [a year after]\"(TBC11).\n"," Many TBCs described how the negative feelings from experienced and anticipated stigmatization in the form of rejection from family members and isolation and estrangement from the community were internalized, affecting their self-worth: ''When I went to work in the sugarcane plantation, I was not thin, I worked hard. When I see my brothers strong like that, and I am not, I feel strange. I sit here, I do not work, and I feel wrong. All my brothers go to work and I want to go. I cannot work anymore; I am no longer able to [get] work after I had TB\" (TBC11). For some TBCs, these negative emotions of rejection and isolation led to suicidal thoughts: ''My whole family was afraid of me and it made me feel rejected. I am afraid of visiting people. When I arrive, sometimes I feel that they will talk about me; ''Look who came, she has TB, we do not want to drink tererê with her\". It is so difficult to see even your mother be afraid of you. It makes you think it would be better if you died\"(TBC12).\n"," Stigmatization of TB also included members of the patient's household. Some TBRs described how they would not talk to others about the diagnosis as they anticipated rejection. These participants also related experienced stigma, where nobody wanted to touch them or be near them, and where they would be looked at from a distance: ''After he got TB, I also stopped going to church. People did not like that I was there\"(TBR11). Receiving prophylactic latent TB treatment also carried stigmatization for TBRs; ''They think I have the disease already, and they started to distance themselves from me and talk about me that I have TB even if I do not have it\" (TBR7).\n"," Summing up the points made in the interviews, this statement from a CM acknowledges that community/public stigmatization is 'damaging' to the TB patient and his/her family. Anticipating stigmatization, and knowing that his/her family will be the victims of secondary stigma, TB patients delay seeking treatment: ''It is only when the disease is very advanced that they will say something. Because when a person gets treatment, their whole house needs to get treatment. When you say that you feel pain, you are damaging your entire family\" (CM17).\n"," We conducted a study to explore TB-associated stigma and its impact on patients and their relatives in a Brazilian indigenous population with hyperendemic transmission of TB. We found that stigma impacts the lives of Guarani-Kaiowá TB patients and their relatives to a considerable degree, and that stigmatization represents an important barrier to treatment in this population. Patients, relatives, and community members alike held beliefs that disease is caused by a weakening of the body and spirit. The poor living conditions of the Guarani-Kaiowá were reflected in the numerous mentions of malnutrition as a risk factor.\n"," Significant community/public stigma surrounds TB in this population, associating TB with negative behavior such as being unclean/contaminated, abusing alcohol and drugs, and/or unable to provide for oneself, leaving TB patients and their families as undesirables in the community. With an unclear understanding of the mechanism of TB transmission, some community members held TB patients personally responsible for spreading the disease in the community. Remarkably similar descriptions of anticipated and community/public stigma show that TB-associated stigma is well known in the community. The question of blame illustrates the relevance of anticipated stigma as a separate category in unpacking TB stigmatization.\n"," Misguided recommendations from the local healthcare service to separate plates and utensils for TB patients contributed to the community/public and experienced/enacted stigmatization of TB. That a TB patient is no longer contagious after a few weeks of treatment was not discussed in any of the interviews, perhaps pointing to another gap in knowledge.\n"," There is limited evidence on the effect of interventions reducing TB stigma [21] . While awareness campaigns are necessary, some studies note that they may contribute to the stigmatization of TB and are not sufficient in themselves to combat TB stigma [22, 23] . Language used in awareness campaigns for airborne infectious diseases tends to stigmatize patients as a risk to the community [24, 25] . Our findings point to a need for raising awareness of TB transmission dynamics in the community and among healthcare service staff as a first step towards reducing TB stigma. As most interview participants in this population did not use a biomedical model to explain disease, an awareness campaign must be sensitive to traditional views of disease transmission. Using an approach that integrates biomedical principles of TB infection and transmission with traditional concepts of disease and health has been successful in other settings [26] [27] [28] .\n"," The sugarcane plantations employing Guarani-Kaiowá men have been identified as likely TB transmission hotspots [13] . Anticipated stigma led to significant delays in seeking treatment for Guarani-Kaiowá plantation workers as they feared losing their jobs. Delaying treatment for several months increases the likelihood of the worker infecting others, and suffering permanent lung damage, affecting future employment. Interventions are urgently needed to facilitate the return to employment for workers after TB treatment. Examples could be adult learning programs, skill upgrading, government involvement in regulations and enforcement of working conditions. Inequalities including limited access to education, land, and subsequently employment opportunities, are the origin of TB transmission in these communities and are part of the discrimination and violation of the human rights of the Guarani-Kaiowá [29] .\n"," Our findings suggest that the Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) scheme may inadvertently cause anticipated, experienced/enacted, and secondary stigma for patients and their relatives as the healthcare worker visits to the patients reveal their TB/LTBI status to the community. Research from Amambai and its neighbor district, Dourados, has shown that the number of contacts needed to treat to prevent one additional case was 10 (CI: [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] for contacts with a tuberculin skin test (TST) reaction �10mm (38% of contacts) [30] significantly lower than a recent average global estimate of 100 [31] . With irregular TST supplies, the healthcare service in the study area gives all household contacts LTBI treatment without prior TST testing. In Amambai only around 60% of contacts are evaluated because of the high mobility of this population, particularly men employed in plantations away from home [32] . Recent genotyping analysis of TB isolates from Dourados showed that transmission occurred outside the household [33] , pointing to a need for better contact tracing. Based on our findings, contact tracing strategies need to consider not only the transient household structure but also the influence of secondary TB stigmatization in this population.\n"," While most patients experienced support from their household, patients, relatives, and community members gave examples of experienced/enacted stigma including avoidance, gossiping, exclusion from religious communities, and sharing meals and joining in for a tererê. Although most participants related that this social exclusion would last until the completion of TB treatment, the internalized/self-stigma of lowered self-esteem persisted. Interventions to build empowerment of patients and their relatives have shown promising results elsewhere [23, 24] . So-called stigma clubs that provide a forum for patients and their families could be a suitable intervention in this setting [34] .\n"," The conceptualization of stigma is increasingly recognized as similar to discrimination, both rooted in broader political, historical, and cultural power structures, inter-and intrapersonal attitudes to a given population group, and perceptions of health and disease [35] [36] [37] . TB patients belonging to marginalized groups often suffer social exclusion and discrimination, potentially compounding the effect of TB stigma and raising the barrier to care [19] . The International Labour Organization has reported intersectional stigma associated with being indigenous and living with HIV and/or TB in Europe, Africa, Australia, North and South America [38] . In a study of high-risk populations in Canada, Gibson et al (2005) found that TB stigmatization was more common in indigenous communities than in immigrant groups (14% versus 3%). For indigenous participants, stigmatization of TB was related to current and past experiences of discrimination of indigenous people, with past forced removals to TB sanatoria still affecting the perception of TB treatment [39] . Our results show that TB-associated stigma has an important impact on TB control in this indigenous community, and that interventions aimed at eliminating the systemic discrimination suffered by this population are urgently needed to reduce TB transmission. Isolation of indigenous TB patients in sanatoria in MS was replaced by decentralized treatment only in recent decades. Our findings suggest that more work needs to be done towards more culturally sensitive healthcare, and that more research is needed on the stigma and power structures in the relationship between the healthcare service and indigenous populations in Brazil.\n"," To our knowledge, our study is the first detailed study of TB-associated stigma in an indigenous population in a high-burden country, and the first public health study to employ a community-based participatory research (CBPR) model in an indigenous population in Brazil. CBPR collaborations raise questions on power dynamics between external researchers, community researchers and interview participants [40, 41] . Developing the interview instruments in collaboration between non-indigenous and indigenous researchers and using Guarani as the interview language acted as a leveler of power. The young age of LP, AB, and the JIGA members also contributed to putting interview participants at ease as they were considered equals by the younger participants and non-superior by the older participants. IVK may have enjoyed a neutral position being a foreigner without ties to the Brazilian social and health services. As a woman, and also speaking Portuguese as a second language, may have contributed to the acceptance of IVK into the homes of the interview participants as she was perceived as a less dominant representative of non-indigenous society. We found that the CBPR model shows promise for working towards filling the data gap on TB and a better understanding of the intersectional stigma in indigenous populations.\n"," Our study only included patients who had received biomedical TB treatment from the healthcare service. We do not know if, and possibly how many, TB patients choose to get treatment exclusively from traditional healers. A study of healthcare performance in a neighboring Guarani-Kaiowá territory described how the concept of a Likert-scale questionnaire was poorly understood [42] . Formally validating a quantitative research instrument was further hindered by the scattering of the Guarani-Kaiowá in small and distant territories. During previous fieldwork, we found that the organization of Guarani-Kaiowá society in closed clan entities makes focus groups unsuitable for stigma studies in this setting. We therefore chose semi-structured interviews for data collection. Triangulation of the data was made possible by interviewing patients and their relatives as well as community members who had not been personally affected by TB.\n"," The interviews were translated from Guarani to Portuguese, and into English for the excerpts in the published text. Although great care was applied to ensure as accurate a translation as possible, minor discrepancies may have occurred where differing syntax obstructs literal translation. However, as authors LP, AB, and IVK discussed each interview in detail immediately after its conclusion and during the translation process to clarify the exact meaning of what was said, we believe to have reduced the impact of translation on our interpretation of the data as much as possible.\n"," TB-associated stigma is an important barrier to seeking treatment and a factor in the continued transmission of the disease in the Guarani-Kaiowá communities. We identified a need for awareness campaigns about TB transmission in the community and among the healthcare service staff. Interventions such as stigma clubs to empower patients and their families are urgently needed to reduce stigmatization. These culturally adapted interventions must be developed in collaboration with community members and consider the role of traditional medicine in the community. Anticipating stigma and with limited opportunities for employment, Guarani-Kaiowá workers would delay treatment. Elimination of TB in this hyperendemic population is unlikely to be achieved without addressing the violations of the human rights of the Guarani-Kaiowá. The epidemiological and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on indigenous communities in Brazil is severe [43] , and presents an additional challenge to TB control in the Guarani-Kaiowá communities both in terms of potential further stigmatization of airborne diseases as well as the transfer of funds from TB control to the combat of COVID-19 [44] . \n","Score: 3.4485500897496113\n","\n","Title: \n","Body Text: Since the first reported cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in November 2019, the incidence in children has remained low and the majority of children are either asymptomatic or have mild illness. [1] This has generated significant interest in the role of pediatric patients in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. When cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection began to rise in the United States, closure of schools and childcare facilities was among the earliest containment strategies enacted by state governments. Communities continue to use infection rates and transmission patterns as the basis for planning safe strategies for return to normal social and industrial functioning and school reopening. For this reason, studying the transmission of the disease among children and families is an area of intense public health interest.\n"," Studies thus far have demonstrated that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 largely occurs within family clusters and adult household contacts have most frequently been identified as the primary source of exposure for SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. [2, 3] Additionally, review of data from elementary schools in Australia and Ireland show minimal transmission among young children attending school during the pandemic. [4, 5] A US study examining household transmission patterns similarly found that children are most often secondarily infected by adults but interestingly identified higher rates of childto-adult transmission compared to studies conducted outside the United States. [6] This highlights important differences that may exist in transmission patterns in the United States. It is imperative to explore these differences further as they may have important social and economic implications.\n"," Transmission in urban communities within the United States is of particular interest. Review of reported US data reveals that racial and ethnic minority populations have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with higher mortality rates. [7] According to US census data, 78% of the population in Detroit, Michigan identifies as African American or black. Detroit has the highest percentage of poverty of any major U.S. city (38%) and residents are less likely to have access to reliable employment, education, housing, and access to food and healthcare. [8] The adverse effects of school closures and quarantine may be more pronounced where these conditions exist [9] and understanding the epidemiology of the disease in these communities is critical. For this reason, we sought to describe transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among households in a pediatric population in Detroit, Michigan.\n"," We identified all pediatric patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal swab using a PCR assay or serum antibody testing at The Children's Hospital of Michigan (a tertiary care center in Detroit, MI) between March 12 -June 15, 2020. This study was approved by the Wayne State University Institutional Review Board and verbal informed consent was obtained from the patient's parent/legal guardian. A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients and the presence or absence of a sick contact was identified in either the emergency department note or the admission history and physical. Every chart reviewed either identified the presence of a sick contact including if they were tested for SARS-CoV-2, or clearly stated that there were no known sick contacts. A household sick contact (HHSC) was defined as someone who lives with the child that either tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 including fever, cough, congestion, sore throat, and diarrhea. From the electronic medical record, we abstracted patient demographics, presenting symptoms, presence of household sick contacts. Illness severity was classified based on published criteria by Dong, et al. [1] as follows: A follow-up phone call survey was conducted and patients were interviewed six weeks after hospital discharge to identify subsequent sick contacts and determine the timing of sick contacts in relation to the study patient's symptoms.\n"," SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in 1264 children, of whom 71 (5.1%) tested positive. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, and severity of illness are shown in Table 1 . When race was reported, 85% of our patient sample identified as African American. When ethnicity was reported, nine percent identified as Hispanic. Though the majority (55%) of children were either asymptomatic or had mild disease, 83% were hospitalized and nearly one quarter (severe 6% and critical 17%) had significant illness.\n"," Among the 71 children, only 30 (42%) identified a HHSC prior to the onset of the study patient's symptoms. Of the 30 households with sick contacts present, 25 households had a contact that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (83%), the remaining five households had HHSCs that were identified based on symptoms alone. In follow-up phone calls where sixty one percent of families were reached, there was no reported illness in any household contact up to six weeks after the child became ill. In all cases where a HHSC was identified, there was no evidence of child-to-adult transmission, and only one case of child-to-child transmission from 3 and 6-year-old siblings to a 47-day old infant. A parent (23/30; 76%) was the most common index HHSC. Characteristics of HHSCs are detailed in Table 2 .\n"," This study adds to a growing body of published literature [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] regarding pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection patterns within household units. Among children with identified HHSCs, we found no evidence of child-to-adult transmission. This is consistent with other studies that suggest that children are not the primary vectors for SARS-CoV-2 infection as was initially suspected; rather children are most commonly infected by adult sick contacts. [2, 3, 10] Interestingly, less than one-half of children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in our institution had a sick contact within the household. This is in contrast to studies from Switzerland and China in which a HHSC was identified in the majority of children studied, concluding that children are mainly infected inside familial clusters. [2, 11] Our results more closely reflect the findings of Mannheim, et al.\n"," from Chicago, an urban location similar to our study setting who reported that only 63% of children reported a HHSC. [10] The reasons for these differences in transmission between settings are not clear. The results reported out of Switzerland and China in comparison to those in urban US cities may be due to differences in disease prevalence or the response to the pandemic in the regions studied. Alternatively, the results may suggest that children in our population were more likely to have become ill as a result of spread from the community rather than a sick contact within the home. This may be the result of greater difficulty in adhering to strict quarantine and social distancing mandates within our urban population where the social determinants of health play a major role 9 . A household contact study done in China by Li, et al. demonstrated no secondary transmission to household contacts when the index patient with COVID-19 is properly quarantined. [12] In a population where adherence to physical distancing and quarantine protocols may be difficult, it is harder to predict disease exposure and therefore may be more difficult to prevent spread. For this reason, understanding the unique factors that impact individual communities will be essential for planning as the pandemic evolves.\n"," There are several limitations to this study. The sample size studied is small. In addition, the reliance on the memory of the individual being queried on the follow-up phone call could have resulted in recall bias and one-third of families could not be reached for follow-up. Finally, the household contacts could have been asymptomatic and this could have resulted in underreporting of transmission within household units. Classification of HHSC as positive based on symptoms alone rather than testing could have inflated the number of households with sick contacts although this accounted for only a minority of HHSC in our study.\n"," Considering the results of our study that show that children in our urban population less frequently became ill from sick contacts within their households, it is important to acknowledge the factors within our population that may contribute to community spread among children. Pandemic response planning, containment strategies, as well as the decision to resume in-person education and extracurricular activities for children should take into account the context of local factors relevant to individual communities as well as the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Further large-scale studies and contact tracing initiatives are necessary to understand the role of children in the transmission of SARS CoV-2 infection in different community settings and continued ongoing surveillance is necessary as schools and childcare centers reopen.\n","Score: 3.439066029143939\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof The role of schools in driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission: not just an open-and-shut case The role of schools in driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission: not just an open-and-shut case\n","Body Text: and (iv) similar rates of infection between schools and communities. However, there are significant methodological limitations associated with each of these early findings, and the ongoing pandemic has directly provided evidence that contradicts the initial findings. We detail the limitations of the evidence for these perceptions and provide strong evidence that schools can be an important SARS-CoV-2 transmission source (Table) .\n"," Susceptibility. Much of the evidence used to describe the decreased burden in children is dependent on symptom-gated testing, which is confounded by testing bias because children are more frequently asymptomatic. As a result, meta-analyses do not support the finding of reduced susceptibility to infection at this point. 2 Studies with surveillance testing strategies report schoolaged children being infected at comparable levels to adults. For instance, UK prevalence surveys in October 2020 in areas with open schools found the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in 18-25 year olds, followed by [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] year olds, with 5-11 year olds having comparable prevalence to working-age adults. 3 This is consistent with seroprevalence survey results in Italy, Utah and Wisconsin. 4, 5 Notably, many studies showing lower pediatric rates were conducted in the spring 2020 when schools were closed and children had lower contact rates. 5 Infectiousness. Early in the pandemic, data indicating children were infrequently the index case (first infection) within a family challenged the notion that children were infectious. 6 Similar to disease burden estimates, this was heavily confounded by lower contact rates of children during the lockdown phase and the lower likelihood of detection of asymptomatic index cases. When children are asymptomatic, their infection may only be detected after diagnosis of an older family member, meaning the infection order does not necessarily mimic case detection. Studies based on surveillance testing find childrens' infectiousness is at least equivalent to adults. Similar infectivity between children and adults has been reported for variants of concern such as B.1.1.7. 7 . The trajectory of the pandemic has also undermined arguments of reduced pediatric susceptibility or infectiousness. For the week ending January 20 children accounted for 25.5% of reported weekly COVID-19 cases (22.2% of the US population are under 18 years old) according to the American Academy of Pediatrics website (https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/). School transmission chains. Studies have reported a lack of observed in-school transmission events between children as evidence against school-based transmission (for example 8 ). This line of reasoning corresponds to the formal logical fallacy of interpreting an absence of evidence as evidence of absence. These studies relied on symptom-gated forward contact tracing, commonly used by U.S. schools. Detecting child-to-child transmission relies on the appearance and reporting of two consecutive symptomatic cases, connected by a transmission event. In a recent simulation study 1 , we examined the performance of such an approach taking into account the low fraction of pediatric COVID-19 infections that are symptomatic (21%) and the low likelihood of a case transmitting to others due to overdispersion (10%). Using a Markov model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we found approximately 4.4% of school-based child-to-child transmission events were detectable using symptom-gated forward contact tracing. Throughout the 2020 and 2021 school years, contact tracing was frequently conducted on a voluntary basis, with the determination of the SARS-CoV-2 status of the primary contact being optional. If optouts from contact tracing were nonrandom, then we would expect contact tracing efficiency as implemented in many US schools to be lower than 4%.\n"," Community and school rates of disease. A fourth line of evidence supporting the argument that schools do not contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 comes from a number of studies that show similar rates of infection in schools and their surrounding communities (for example 9 ).\n"," With datasets incorporating multiple counties and their corresponding school district, these studies show a correlation between the county in-school infection rate and the overall county. However, this line of reasoning corresponds to the formal logical fallacy of interpreting a correlation as implying (a lack of) causality.\n"," Ideally, we would determine the impact of school openings on the community through randomized studies. Without randomization, the causal flow could be in the opposite direction. If one starts from the premise that school transmission is more frequent than in the community and that there is free mixing between schools and communities, then the correlation between school and community COVID-19 levels would support the opposite conclusion. Chains of infection, once seeded inside schools, would spread rapidly into the surrounding communities, and communities with highest school-based transmission would also have the highest overall infection rates.\n"," In a recent study, we simulated this scenario to ask whether the rates and kinetics of detected cases in schools and communities would let us infer that schools were responsible for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if that were indeed the case. 1 Using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in children and adults (with age-specific contact rates and location-specific transmission probabilities) we asked the question, \"if transmission rates in schools were (hypothetically) far higher than the community, would detected case rates in schools allow us to see that?\" Despite the simulated higher infection prevalence in children, detected case rates in children appeared similar to or lower than those of adults, and as total infection rates in the population increased, the gap between detected case rates narrowed. 1 This suggests that open schools would seed chains of infection that spread rapidly into the community, and given the relatively rapid kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the infection rates in schools and communities would quickly converge. 1 School reopening in the UK in the fall of 2021 led to a new spike in cases in the school-age population, which was followed shortly afterwards by a spike in cases in the 30-40 age group, consistent with a scenario where children are infected at school and subsequently infect their family members.\n"," Roughly half of the United States population is either in school, works in a school, or is a first degree contact of individuals in the previous two categories. It is not surprising that there are real-world data consistent with the possibility that in-school transmission can impact the disease burden in surrounding communities. In addition to the evidence just cited, we point out a few other key points.\n"," Compelling evidence of the impact of in-school transmission on case counts can be found by comparing counties where schools were conducting in-person learning to areas where schools were virtual. For example, a large online study in the US reported that individuals were more likely to report COVID-19 like symptoms in areas where schools were open compared to areas with remote learning, an effect that was attenuated in communities using multiple mitigation measures. 10 Similarly, school reopenings in regions of the US with limited measures in place to mitigate in-school transmission are associated with elevated case counts. 9\n"," A key concern with school reopening is the risk of superspreader events. Superspreading is an important driver of pandemics and, in particular, the COVID-19 pandemic. Ideal conditions for superspreading include prolonged indoor exposure between individuals with poor ventilation.\n"," Additionally, the most potent superspreaders have been individuals who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic and mobile. 11 Schools combine all of these elements with clear potential consequences for the children and staff they bring together and their communities.\n"," With that said, there is evidence that schools can operate successfully without significant inschool transmission when appropriate mitigation strategies are employed. The UK and Singapore both reopened with minimal in-school transmission in the summer term of 2020. A Japanese study matching in person and remote schooling communities showed no difference in cases in the surrounding communities between remote and in person schooling in spring 2020. 12 In each of these cases, community spread in the country was extremely low (incidence was consistently less than 1/100000 in Japan). Additionally, in-person schooling was conducted with multiple layered interventions such as masking, clear ventilation guidelines, and strict hygiene practices.\n"," Knowing that schools create an efficient setting for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is important that we implement multilayered strategies that are science-based and rigorously implemented. We describe several key components here.\n"," Limit transmission by infected individuals. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is frequently airborne and aerosol-driven, even from asymptomatically-infected individuals, making it crucial to improve air quality effectively reducing indoor transmission. Appropriate ventilation is critical: regular turnover of the air inside a closed space dramatically decreases viral load. High-quality filtration units with a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) greater than 9 (corresponding to filters that can remove particles 3 microns or smaller in diameter) can be helpful. Ionizers purify the air in the room by creating negative ions that attach to aerosolized particles, increasing the rate at which they settle to the ground. There is a pressing need for clear science-backed standards for indoor air quality, formulated with the reduction of airborne transmission as a goal. Notably, there is a large gap between the standards that actually improve air quality and the standards that can be implemented. For example, in the US, some schools have modern HVAC with filters, but most do not, creating a problematic gap. Air quality monitoring should be conducted in schools, and parents, teachers, and school boards should be informed of the results and provided resources for needed improvements.\n"," As a second layer of defense, high quality, well-fitting masks have been shown to provide important protection against infection. Masking policies that fail to ensure high quality masks are used effectively will undermine their efficacy. While there have been calls in the popular press for removing the requirement for masks in school, these calls are not supported by science. 13 Given the waning efficacy of vaccines over time, and their vulnerability to immune evasion resulting from viral evolution, masks provide a critical layer of protection for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.\n"," Reduce the likelihood that infected individuals are in schools. Surveillance testing is a critical tool to identify and isolate infected individuals. At the university level, this has been shown to be extremely effective when testing has fast turnaround and contact tracing and isolation guidelines are clear. However slow turnaround times, using lower sensitivity rapid antigen tests, opt-in policies limiting participation and testing pools that are too large can undermine the efficacy of surveillance testing. Further, we advocate that changes to quarantine and isolation protocols should be made with the intention of limiting transmission in schools, as opposed to limiting time away from in-person learning. In addition, children who thrived under remote learning options, or for whom the risk of infection is too high (either due to their own health or the health of a household member) should be able to continue accessing remote learning indefinitely. This reduces the number of potentially infected individuals in school, further lowering the risk of in person schooling.\n"," Provide community support. Even the most rigorously implemented strategies are unlikely to provide sufficient protection against the flood of cases that come from widespread community transmission. Limiting community transmission will support schools and extend the runway for safe operation. Schools might need to nimbly shift to remote learning should community burden become too high. It is critical to prepare for this possibility so that educational quality is not compromised and ensure that all students have access to the necessary technology to engage in an equitable way. This includes developing necessary technologies and investment in infrastructure to enable engagement of the most vulnerable students. It is a critically important problem to solve: we must ensure that students who are most vulnerable to the consequences of a raging pandemic and remote learning continue to receive the education they need and that their communities are safe.\n"," Remove the fluff. We have learned that many mitigation measures are not effective and removing them will make it easier to focus on effective measures. This includes temperature checks, plexiglass barriers, and excessive surface cleaning. These mitigation measures become \"hygiene theater\" in that they provide false reassurance that interventions are in place while also being ineffective at preventing spread and contributing to \"pandemic fatigue\"declining trust in and energy for pandemic mitigations. Guidelines need to be updated and communicated as technologies are developed and science progresses. We need to move away from overly relying on vaccines to limit transmission, as they are only one part of what needs to be a multi-pronged strategy as new variants continue to emerge. While increasing levels of vaccination is an important public-health goal, as it mitigates the worst outcomes, vaccine efficacy against transmission should be complemented with other measures aimed to reduce transmission. This is particularly important as vaccine efficacy against transmission is known to wane against emerging variants and as time since vaccination increases. 14 It is important that schools adopt multiple strategies to limit transmission such as masking, given a correctly-fitted N95 mask provides a critical, substantial and reliable impediment to viral transmission. 15 Similarly, because some of the effective interventions (air quality improvement and testing in particular) have a nonlinear effect on risk mitigation, cutting corners on risk mitigation steps can degrade their utility very quickly. This is also hygiene theater and the use of theoretically effective but practically ineffective mitigation measures can again provide false reassurance and contribute to declining trust in mitigation. Assessing the effectiveness of these interventions in a data-driven way (for example, using CO2 monitors to assess air quality) is key. Model-based approaches should be used to pressure-test mitigation strategies, and governing authorities should update the science regularly to keep up with viral evolution.\n"," Throughout the course of the pandemic, the issue of how to keep schools open safely has been a consistently contentious and complicated issue. Unfortunately, the discussion has often centered around numerous false dichotomies and limited ambition on how to truly tackle this challenge. For instance, many discussions pit ostensible direct harms to children from mitigation measures against the direct harm to children from COVID-19 infection. Other discussions pit student mental health against protection from in-person transmission of disease. Framing the question in these ways creates what appears to be an impossible dilemma. Here, we argue that many of these dilemmas are not really dilemmas: children are inextricably a part of the community, and the harms from in-school transmission extend to the entire community and impact the trajectory of the pandemic; schools enable disease transmission and it is possible to curb transmission; children often do better learning in person and it is possible to keep them safely in school in the midst of the pandemic with appropriate mitigations.\n"," \"Learning to live with the virus\" is not synonymous with permitting rampant viral spread. Bringing the crisis phase of the current COVID-19 pandemic to an end is a goal that we all aspire towards, but it will take work on our part to make it come to pass-at present the disease is nowhere near achieving endemic conditions. The first step in that process is to limit disease spread and focusing on limiting in-school spread is critical for limiting transmission. Fortunately, we are close to the point where science-driven interventions make the goal of limiting in-school spread achievable. We should make it a public-health priority to keep schools open without accelerating the pandemic.\n","Score: 3.422774433162845\n","\n","Title: Do school closures reduce community transmission of COVID-19? A systematic review of observational studies\n","Body Text: School closures have been a common strategy to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2 April 2020, 172 nations had enacted full closures or partial 'dismissals', affecting nearly 1·5 billion children 2 . However, school closures have significant negative consequences on children's wellbeing and education, which will impact on life chances and long-term health 3, 4 . Closures may exacerbate existing inequalities. Children in higher income families may have better opportunities for remote learning.\n"," Moreover, whilst the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) collectively in limiting community spread is established, the specific contribution of school closures remains unclear. Observational studies suggest that school-aged children, particularly teenagers, play a role in transmission to peers and bringing infection into households 8 , although the relative importance compared to adults remains unclear 9 . Younger children appearless susceptible to infection and may play a smaller role in community transmission, compared with older children and adults 10 . Whilst some modelling studies have suggested that school closures can reduce SARS-CoV-2 community transmission 5 , others disagree 6, 7 .\n"," A rapid systematic review published in April 2020 found only limited evidence of the effectiveness of school closures in controlling the spread of coronaviruses. 1 However, this study was undertaken very early in the pandemic and included no observational data on SARS-CoV-2.

The authors report a null effect of school closures on growth rate of SARS-CoV-2 incidence, with narrow confidence intervals for France and the USA, but a regression coefficient suggestive of a non-significant preventative effect in Italy (-0·11 (95% CI -0·25, 0·03)). Neidhofer et al. 18 (serious risk of bias) used a difference in difference comparison to estimate reduction in deaths in the 18 days post-school closure in Argentina, Italy and South Korea; compared with synthetic controls derived from the weighted average of epidemic curves from countries that closed schools later.

The authors reported a 63%-90% reduction, 21%-35% reduction, and 72%-96% reduction in the daily average COVID-19 deaths in Argentina, Italy and South Korea respectively. The small number of cumulative deaths in Argentina and South Korea at the start of the study period made reliable extrapolation of mortality trends to inform the control units unlikely.\n"," The other three studies did not analytically adjust for other NPIs. Matzinger et al. 17 (moderate risk of bias) identified the three US states which introduced school closures first, and with a sufficient lag before implementing other measures to assess their specific impact. They plotted incidence rates on a log2 scale and identified points of inflexion in the period after school closure. This assumes exponential growth in the absence of interventions, which may not have occurred given changes to testing regimes. The doubling time of new cases in Georgia slowed from 2·1 to 3·4 days one week after closing schools. Similar results were observed in Mississippi (1·4 to 3·4 days) and Tennessee (2·0 to 4·2 days). The authors also noted inflexion points for hospitalisations and mortality, although numerical changes were not reported. Tennessee showed a slowing in hospitalisations after one week, and deaths another week later; whereas Mississippi shows a slowing of both at the same time (after one week) -the authors do not comment on this discrepancy. Georgia lacked early hospitalisation data to make such a comparison. Iwata et al. 15 (serious risk of bias) used time series analysis with Bayesian Inference to estimate the effects of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Japan, reporting a null effect. Whilst growth in cases was observed during the study period, the number of cases remained low (<100 cases per day). Publicly available data 24 shows implementation of mass gathering bans occurred with school closures, and foreign travel bans were already in place. Stein-Zamir et al. 21 (critical risk of bias) reported an age-stratified epidemic curve of SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Jerusalem, with identification of the timing of school closures and reopenings. They show a large reduction in incidence starting one week after schools closed, with proportional reductions across all age groups; and a resurgence in case numbers around two weeks after schools were gradually re-opened, predominantly driven by younger age groups. There is no adjustment for other NPIs, though school closures were implemented alongside mass gathering bans and other social distancing rules; whilst school re-openings coincided with lifting hospitality and retail restrictions, and relaxing mass gathering bans 25 . Mass testing of a single secondary school was undertaken as part of an outbreak investigation, and the sharp increase in the number of new cases amongst young people is almost entirely accounted for by the cases identified by this.\n"," Pooled multiple-area before-after comparisons. Three studies 13, 14, 20 reported data on multiple geographical units, and then pooled the results into one unified estimate of effect using regression analysis.\n"," One study had a low risk of bias and reported a null effect. Courtemanche et al. 14 used a fixed effects model (which accounts for inter-area sociodemographic differences) to estimate the effect of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in US counties. They adjusted for relevant NPIs and testing regime confounders, and reported a null effect of school closures on growth rate applying a lag of either 10 or 20 days. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\n"," The copyright holder for this this version posted January 4, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.02.21249146 doi: medRxiv preprint Two studies had a higher risk of bias due to a lack of adjustment for confounding NPIs, and reported preventative effects. Auger et al. 13 (moderate risk of bias) used interrupted time series analysis to calculate the rate of change in SARS-CoV-2 incidence and mortality in US states, and then used negative binomial regression to combine effect sizes into one pooled national estimate. Stepwise regression was used to build models, excluding covariates with P values >0·20, resulting in exclusion of several NPIs and testing regime data from their models. They estimated that school closures reduced incidence and mortality by c.60%. Yehya et al. 20 (serious risk of bias) also used negative binomial regression to combine the observed effects in US states, with COVID-19 mortality as the outcome measure. Relevant sociodemographic differences between states were accounted for as confounders in the multivariable model. However, they did not adjust for the effect of other NPIs. They estimated that school closures reduced COVID-19-related deaths by 5% per day.\n"," Pooled multiple-area cross-sectional comparisons Two studies 16,19 considered countries from around the world in a cross-sectional design in which NPIs were considered as binary variables on a specific date: in place or not in place, and the cumulative incidence to that point was compared to the number of new cases of COVID-19 over a subsequent follow-up period; countries were then compared using regression analysis to elicit independent effect sizes for individual policies including school closures. This approach reduces bias from different testing regimes over time and between countries. However, the use of a single cut-off date for whether school closure was in place means that that the effects of long-standing and more recent school closures were pooled. Both studies reported preventative effects of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 incidence (Juni et al. 16 :23% relative reduction in the incidence rate, Wong et al. 19 : 50% relative reduction).\n"," Juni et al. 16 (serious risk of bias) used an exposure cut-off date of 20 March 2020 with a tenday lag period and seven-day follow-up period. The authors adjusted for a comprehensive set of sociodemographic and geographical confounders (see Table 3 ) but did not adjust for the effect of other NPIs because they were implemented around the same time as school closures. Wong et al. 19 (serious risk of bias) used a cut-off data of 31 March with a 14-day lag period and a 14-day follow-up period. The authors only adjusted for potential sociodemographic confounding from gross domestic product and population density. The authors did adjust for the presence of other NPIs using the Stringency Index, but this does not include relevant measures such as social distancing rules or mask wearing. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\n"," The copyright holder for this this version posted January 4, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.02.21249146 doi: medRxiv preprint\n"," We identified ten studies that provided a quantitative estimate of the impact of school closures on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The studies spanned a range of countries and were heterogenous in design. Findings ranged from no association to a 62% relative reduction in incidence and mortality rate 13 . The studies at lowest risk of bias reported no association 14,22 (figure 2), whilst those with a higher risk of bias generally reported preventative effects. An exception was a paper by Matzinger et al. 17 which focused on US states that implemented school closures first and without co-interventions, and reported a two-fold increase in the time for cases to double one week after school closures.\n"," A major challenge with estimating the 'independent' effect of school closures is disentangling their effect from other NPIs occurring at the same time. Most studies tried to account for this, but it is unclear how effective these methods were. In direct correspondence one author reported that adjustment for other NPI was not possible due to clustering. 16 Even where adjustment occurred there is a risk of residual confounding, which likely overestimated preventative associations; and collinearity (highly-correlated independent variables meaning that is impossible to estimate specific effects for each) which could bias results towards or away from the null. Four studies did not specifically seek to estimate an effect size for school closures, instead studying school closures as an example of NPIs. These studies may not have specified the model in an optimal way to estimate effects of school closures. The divergent results for the USA, highlight these problems and may suggest that methodological differences are an important cause in the variation of the findings.\n"," The strength of this study is that it draws on empirical data from actual school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic and includes data from 146 countries. By necessity, we include observational rather than randomised controlled studies, as understandably no jurisdictions have undertaken such trials. We were unable to meta-analyse due to study heterogeneity. We were unable to examine differences between primary and secondary schools as no studies distinguished between them, despite the different transmission patterns for younger and older children.\n"," The studies are not able to distinguish between the direct and indirect effect of school closures. Indirect effects might include parents staying at home (reducing workplace contacts), and the signalling effect that closing schools sends to the general population to be cautious and reduce social contacts. Whilst some studies reported effects on mortality, it was not always clear whether the specified timeframe was appropriate. Interventions affecting children would be expected to have a longer lag than other interventions: to allow time for impacts on infections in older adults and ultimately mortality. Data are also lacking from low-income countries, where sociocultural factors may produce different effects of school closures on transmission to high income settings, leaving a substantial gap in the evidence base.\n"," Our estimates describe the impact of school closures policies early in the year. School reopening, with substantial infection prevention measures in place, may have a very different effect on community transmission. Where school re-openings have occurred but other NPIs have remained, less biased estimates of effect may be possible.

In addition, none of the included studies used mobility or genomic sequencing of viral strains which may have allowed for a mechanistic understanding of how school closures effect community transmission patterns.\n"," The variability in findings from our included studies are likely to reflect issues with study design. However, this may also suggest that there is no single effect of school closures on community transmission and that contextual factors may modify the impact of closures in different countries and over time. If the purpose of school closures is reduction in social contacts among children, the level of social mixing between children that occurs outside school once schools are closed is likely to be a key determinant of their effect at reducing community transmission . This will be influenced by other NPIs, and other key contextual factors including background prevalence of infection, age of children affected, as well as sociodemographic and cultural factors.\n"," Different countries have adopted different approaches to controlling COVID-19. In the first wave of the pandemic school closures were common, and in some places one of the first major social distancing measures used. In contrast, the UK Government's strategy for managing the second wave has prioritised keeping educational institutions open. With such varied findings and quality of evidence on the effect of school closures on limiting community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and given the harmful effects of school closures 3,4 , policymakers and governments need to take a measured approach before implementing school closures in response to rising infection rates.Other evidence, such as the harms of school closures and transmission patterns in children should be considered alongside the evidence presented here when making decisions about school closures. Less damaging measures such as effective test, trace and isolate regimes in schools, as well as enhanced hygiene and social distancing measures should be considered as alternatives to school closures. This work also underscores the need for a robust and systematic approaches to the evaluation of all interventions deployed in a pandemic, not just those readily amenable to randomisation. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\n"," The copyright holder for this this version posted January 4, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.02.21249146 doi: medRxiv preprint\n"," There is no direct funding for this study.

A systematic review of observational studies\n","Body Text: School closures have been a common strategy to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2 April 2020, 172 nations had enacted full closures or partial 'dismissals', affecting nearly 1·5 billion children. 1 As cases of COVID-19 started to fall, many countries looked to reopen schools, often with significant mitigation measures in place. 2 Over the northern hemisphere winter of 2020-21, many countries again closed schools with the aim of controlling a resurgence of cases. School closures have substantial negative consequences for children's well-being and education, which will impact on life chances and long-term health. 3 4 Closures exacerbate existing inequalities, with greater impacts on children from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds because those from higher income families have better opportunities for remote learning.\n"," The role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) collectively in limiting Strengths and limitations of this study ► While the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions as a whole in limiting community spread of SARS-CoV-2 is beyond doubt, the specific role of school closures is less clear because of the smaller role that children play in transmission of the disease. ► This is the first systematic review of the empirical evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic of the effectiveness of school closures and reopenings on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. ► We include data from 150 countries, investigating both school closures and school reopenings. ► We were unable to meta-analyse due to data heterogeneity.\n"," Open access community spread is established. However, the specific contribution of school closures remains unclear. Observational studies suggest that school-aged children, particularly teenagers, play a role in transmission to peers and bringing infection into households, 5 although the relative importance compared with adults remains unclear. 6 Younger children appear less susceptible to infection and may play a smaller role in community transmission, compared with older children and adults. 7 Although some modelling studies have suggested that school closures can reduce SARS-CoV-2 community transmission, 8 others disagree. 9 10 A rapid systematic review published in April 2020 found a small number of studies of the effectiveness of school closures in controlling the spread of COVID-19. 11 However, this review was undertaken very early in the pandemic and included no observational data on SARS-CoV-2. Since then many studies on the effects of closing or reopening schools on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission have been published, but there has been no systematic review of these studies. A clearer understanding of the impact of school closures and reopenings on community transmission is essential to aid policymakers in deciding if and when to implement school closures in response to rising virus prevalence, and when it is prudent to reopen schools. Here, we synthesise the observational evidence of the impact of closing or reopening schools on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n"," The study protocol for this systematic review is registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020213699).\n"," We included any empirical study which reported a quantitative estimate of the effect of school closure or reopening on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We considered 'school' to include early years settings (eg, nurseries or kindergartens), primary schools and secondary schools, but excluded further or higher education (eg, universities). Community transmission was defined as any measure of community infection rate, hospital admissions or mortality attributed to COVID-19. We included studies published in 2020 or 2021 only. We included preprints, peer-reviewed and grey literature. We did not apply any restriction on language, but all searches were undertaken in English. We excluded prospective modelling studies and studies in which the assessed outcome was exclusively transmission within the school environment rather than the wider community.\n"," We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID- 19 Research Database (including medRxiv and SSRN), ERIC, the British Education Index and the Australian Education Index, searching title and abstracts for terms related to SARS-CoV-2 AND terms related to schools or NPIs. To search the grey literature, we searched Google. We also included papers identified through professional networks. Full details of the search strategy are included in online supplemental appendix A. Searches were undertaken first on 12 October 2020 and updated on 7 January 2021.\n"," Article titles and abstracts were imported into the Rayyan QCRI webtool. 12 Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, retrieved full texts of potentially relevant articles and assessed eligibility for inclusion.\n"," Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data extraction was performed using a pre-agreed extraction template which collected information on publication type (peer-reviewed or preprint), country, study design, exposure type (school closure or reopening), setting type (primary or secondary), study period, unit of observation, confounders adjusted for, other NPIs in place, analysis method, outcome measure and findings. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias In Nonrandomised Studies of Interventions tool 13 to evaluate bias.\n"," Discrepancies were resolved by discussion in the first instance and by a third reviewer where necessary.\n"," Given the heterogeneous nature of the studies, prohibiting meta-analysis, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Schools often reopened with significant COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures in place, meaning that the effect of lifting restrictions may have been different from the effect of imposing them. We therefore considered the studies of school closures and school reopenings separately. We also aimed to evaluate differential effects for primary and secondary schools if data allowed.\n"," There was no patient or public involvement in this study.\n"," We identified 7474 studies (figure 1). After removing 2339 duplicates, 5135 unique records were screened for inclusion. We excluded 4842 records at the title or abstract stage, leaving 293 records for full-text review. Of these, 40 met the inclusion criteria.\n"," Description of studies Included studies are described in table 1, grouped by exposure type and study design. Of these, 32 studies 14 15 18-21 23 24 26 29-40 42-44 46-53 reported the effect of school closures on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 11 16 22-25 27 28 35 43-45 examined school reopening and 3 16 17 41 investigated the effect of school holidays. Some studies considered more than one exposure. All studies used data from national government sources or international data repositories. A total of 15 Open access studies were from peer-reviewed journals, while 24 studies were from preprint servers and 1 study was a conference abstract.\n"," All studies were ecological in nature, that is, the unit of analysis was national or regional. Of the school closure studies, 13 reported data from a single country or region (the USA (n=10), 14 19-21 33 37 42 47-49 Italy (n=1), 23 Japan (n=1) 29 and Switzerland (n=1) 43 ); 4 reported discrete estimates for several countries 26 38 44 53 and 15 studies pooled data from multiple countries (globally (n=8), 31 34-36 39 46 50 51 Europe only (n=2), 24 30 Europe and other high-income countries (n=5) 15 18 32 40 52 ). The studies on school reopening generally reported on single countries (Germany (n=2), 22 28 USA (n=1), 25 Switzerland (n=1), 43 Belgium (n=1), 27 Israel (n=1), 45 Italy (n=1) 23 ), but one reported discrete estimates for three countries (Denmark, Germany and Norway), 44 two pooled data from multiple countries globally 16 35 and one pooled data from multiple European countries. 24 Of the three school holiday studies, one reported on Germany, 41 one pooled data from 24 countries globally 16 and one pooled data from multiple European countries. 17 The majority of studies (n=24) did not specify the type of school setting being studied. However, eight studies specified that they were reporting on primary and secondary schools only, 14 16 18 19 27 29 37 49 and six additionally include early years settings. 22-24 44 45 48 The two remaining studies used the date of primary school (n=1) 15 or secondary school (n=1) 43 closure as their exposure date, but did not indicate this was temporally distinct from closure of the other setting. Very few studies reported independent effect sizes for different setting types: two closure studies 24 48 and four reopening studies. 16 22 24 44 Studies that specifically sought to estimate an effect of school closure policy on SARS-CoV-2 transmission included eight school closure studies, 14 22 23 25 28 44 45 and three school holiday studies. The remaining studies primarily sought to estimate the effect of NPIs (but reported an independent estimate for schools, alongside estimates for other NPIs within their analysis).\n"," The studies used different analytic approaches: regression models (n=24), 14 17 19-21 25 26 28 30 31 33 35 36 39-42 44 46 48 49 51-53 Bayesian modelling (n=3), 15 18 47 comparison to a synthetic control group (n=4), 24 34 38 44 machine learning approaches (n=2), 43 50 time series analysis (n=1) 29 and visual representation of changes in transmission over time compared against the timing of school policy interventions, with or without formal statistical analysis (n=4). 16 22 37 45 We identified three study designs used to estimate the effect of school closures: pooled multiple-area before-after comparisons (n=22), 14 31 51 52 In most instances of school closures, particularly in European countries, other NPIs were introduced at or around the same time. Some studies dealt with this at the design stage, choosing to study places where school closures were done in (relative) isolation 37 and some at the analytical stage (typically by undertaking regression and having multiple comparator countries). Some studies did not appear to have a mechanism in place to deal with this potential confounding. 32 40 44 52 Studies which pooled data from multiple areas also adjusted for other potential confounders, such as population factors (eg, proportion of population aged ≥65 years, population density) and SARS-CoV-2 testing regimes.\n"," Among school closure studies, 18 14 15 19 20 24 26 29 31-34 37 39 42-44 50 51 reported effects on  incidence, 11 14 19 21 30 38-40 42 46 52 53 on mortality, 1 37 on  hospital admissions and mortality and 8 18 21 23 35 36 43 47 48 on an estimate of the effective Reproductive number (R) (derived from incidence and/or mortality data). Of the school reopening studies, six reported effects on incidence, 16 22 24 28 44 45 two on hospitalisations 25 44 and four on R. 23 27 35 43 Two school holiday studies reported an effect on incidence, 16 41 while the other reported on mortality. 17 The assumed lag period from school policy changes to changes in incidence rate varied between 7 and 20 days, with longer time periods of 26-28 days generally assumed for mortality.\n"," Risk of bias is summarised in table 2. Of the school closure studies, 14 were found to be at moderate risk of bias, 14 32 40 44 52 Of the school reopening studies, four were found to be at moderate risk, 24 25 28 35 four at serious risk 23 27 43 44 and three at critical risk of bias. 16 22 45 The school holiday studies were found to be at moderate (n=1), 41 serious (n=1) 17 or critical (n=1) 16 risk of bias.\n"," There was significant heterogeneity in the study findings (table 3): 17 studies 14 24 31 32 34-38 40 42-44 48-51 reported that closing schools was associated with a reduction in transmission rates; 9 15 Open access between school closures and transmission; 5 19 21 33 46 53 reported mixed findings with evidence of a reduction in transmission in some analyses but not others and 1 study 52 reported that school closures were associated with an increase in mortality. The reported effect size of closing schools ranged from precise estimates of no effect 26 to approximately halving the incidence 14 ; and from approximately doubling mortality 52 to approximately halving mortality. 14 The studies at the highest risk of bias generally reported large reductions in transmission associated with school closures, while studies at lower levels of bias reported more variable findings ( figure 2 ). Of the school reopening studies, six 22-25 28 44 reported no increase in transmission associated with reopening of schools, while two 16 43 reported mixed findings and three 27 35 45 reported increases in transmission. Of the four school reopening studies at lowest risk of bias, 24 25 28 35 three 24 25 28 reported no association between school reopenings and transmission. analysed before-after data on multiple geographical units, and then pooled the results into one unified estimate of effect (generally by using regression analysis). These studies relied on different timings of NPI implementation in different areas to establish their independent effects, and were therefore at risk of collinearity if compared areas implemented the same NPIs at similar times. These studies were also at risk of bias from sociocultural differences between compared areas. Of these studies, 11 14 24 32 34-36 40 42 48-50 reported that school closures were associated with significantly reduced community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 7 15 18 20 26 30 39 47 reported no association and 4 19 21 33 46 reported mixed findings. Those studies found to be at higher risk of bias, generally because they were judged not to have adjusted appropriately for NPIs, testing or sociodemographic data, tended to report reductions in transmission; whereas those studies at lower risk of bias were as likely to report null effects as they were reductions (see figure 2) .\n"," Of the three studies 20 using this approach which were considered to be at the lowest risk of confounding, two reported no association and one reported that school closures reduced transmission. Courtemanche et al 20 used a fixed effects model (to account for interarea sociodemographic differences) in an event study design to estimate the effect of NPIs (including school closures) on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in US counties between March and April 2020. They adjusted for relevant NPIs, testing regime confounders and underlying trends in each counties' growth rates, and reported a null effect of school closures on growth rate, applying a lag of either 10 or 20 days. Hsiang et al 26 The comparator group included those holidaying in week 6 or not at all, and was itself associated with excess mortality of 8.6 (95% CI 6.9 to 10.3). between January and June 2020. They identified time periods in which the NPIs in a given country were static, and calculated the 'R ratio' by dividing the average daily R of each period by the R from the last day of the previous period. They reported pooled estimates, regressed across all countries, for the first 28 days after introduction/relaxation of each NPI. Although the CIs for each daily effect size included 1, the trend was clearly towards a reduction in transmission following school closure implementation.\n"," We identified seven studies 23 29 37 38 43 44 53 that compared community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before and after school closure for single geographical units, and did not pool the results with those of other areas. This approach controls for confounding from population sociodemographic factors, but remains vulnerable to confounding from other NPIs and temporal changes to testing regimes. As with the pooled before-after comparison studies, those studies at higher risk of bias from confounding were more likely to report reductions in transmission associated with school closures. One study using this approach was found to be at moderate risk of bias. Matzinger et al 37 identified the three US states which introduced school closures first, and with a sufficient lag before implementing other measures to assess their specific impact. They plotted incidence rates on a log 2 scale and identified points of inflexion in the period after school closure. This assumes exponential growth in the absence of interventions, which may not have occurred given changes to testing regimes. Open access observed in Tennessee (2.0 to 4.2 days after 1 week) and Mississippi (1.4 to 3.4 days after 2 weeks). The authors also noted inflexion points for hospitalisations and mortality at later time points, although numerical changes were not reported. Tennessee showed a slowing in hospitalisations 1 week after cases, and mortality 1 week after hospitalisation. Mississippi showed a slowing in hospitalisations and mortality at the same time, 1 week after cases-the authors do not comment on this discrepancy. Georgia lacked early hospitalisation data to make such a comparison.\n"," Pooled multiple-area comparisons of interventions in place at a fixed time point Three studies 31 51 52 considered countries from around the world using a design in which NPIs were considered as binary variables on a specific date (ie, in place or not in place), and the cumulative incidence or mortality to that point was compared with the number of new cases of COVID-19 over a subsequent follow-up period; countries were then compared using regression analysis to elicit independent effect sizes for individual policies including school closures. This approach reduces bias from different testing regimes over time and between countries. However, the use of a single cut-off date for whether school closure was in place means that the effects of long-standing and recent school closures were pooled, introducing misclassification bias. Two of these studies 31 51 were at serious risk of bias and reported that school closures were associated with lower incidence; and one study 52 was at critical risk of bias and reported that closing schools was not associated with incidence but was associated with increased mortality. Each of these studies was at high risk of confounding from other NPIs, in addition to the risk of misclassification bias described above.\n"," Eleven studies 16 22-25 27 28 35 43-45 considered the effect of school reopening on subsequent SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. 24 Of these, five were pooled multiplearea before-after comparison studies, 24 25 28 35 43 and six were within-area multiple-area before-after comparison studies. 16 22 23 27 44 45 These studies benefited from more staggered lifting of restrictions (compared with their implementation), and more stable testing regimes. Of the four studies at a lower risk of bias, 24 25 28 35 three 24 25 28 reported that schools were reopened without associated increases in transmission, while one 35 reported increased transmission. Garchitorena et al 24 compared incidence data, with adjustment for underdetection, from 32 European countries, using multivariate linear regression models with adjustment for other NPIs and fixed effects to account for intercountry sociodemographic differences. They reported no association with incidence rates up to 16 September 2020 of reopening early years settings (0% mean change in incidence rate (95% CI −8% to 8%)), primary schools (2% (95% CI −7% to 10%)), or secondary schools (−1% (95% CI −7% to 9%)). Harris et al 25 estimated the effect of school reopenings on COVID-19 hospitalisation in the USA using an event study model, with analysis at the county-level. They adjusted for other NPIs, and used fixed effects to account for calendar week effects and intercounty differences. They applied a 1-week lag period, and compared data from 10 weeks before to 6 weeks after school reopenings. They initially report null effects when pooling the effects across all counties, however, post hoc sensitivity analyses suggested that there were increases in hospitalisations for counties that were in the top 25% of baseline hospitalisation rate at school reopening (compared with null effects for the bottom 75%). Isphording et al 28 compared changes to the COVID-19 incidence rate in German counties that were first to reopen schools after the summer holidays, with those yet to reopen (noting that the timing of such decisions was set years in advance, and not changed due to the pandemic). They considered data from 2 weeks before to 3 weeks after school reopenings, and adjusted for mobility data, and used fixed effects to account for intercounty sociodemographic differences. They reported no association between school reopenings and incidence. One study Li et al, 35 is described above as it reports on the effect of both school closures and school reopenings around the world. As for school closures, their effect sizes for each individual day in the 28-day period postschool reopenings were not always statistically significant, but the data trend is clearly that of an increase in transmission associated with school reopenings.\n"," The seven studies 16 22 23 27 43-45 at serious and critical risk of confounding are more difficult to interpret, again predominantly due to the high risk of confounding. Three 16 23 44 reported no association between school reopening and transmission, two 22 43 reported mixed findings and two 27 45 reported increased transmission following reopening of schools.\n"," Three studies 16 17 41 reported changes in SARS-CoV-2 community transmission associated with school holidays. These holidays occurred according to predetermined timetables and are therefore unlikely to be influenced by background trends in infections. Two studies examined associations between timing of summer holidays on incidence rates in Germany 41 and in multiple European countries, 16 respectively. The other study 17 reported on the timing of the February/March 2020 half-term break timing in countries that neighbour the Alps. Of these, one reported mixed findings on the effect of summer holidays, 16 and two reported that school holidays were associated with increased transmission. 17 41 The authors of these studies considered the primary exposure to be increased social contact from international travel, rather than decreases from the temporary closure or schools.\n"," One school closure study, 48 three school reopening studies 16 22 44 and one study looking at closures and Open access reopenings 24 considered evidence of independent effects for different types of school closures.\n"," Two studies reported independent effect sizes for different settings, but found considerable overlap between the effect sizes, and noted high temporal correlation between the policy timings meaning that collinearity limits the interpretability of the findings. Garchitorena et al 24 (moderate risk of bias) reported the effect of both school closures and school reopenings on changes to R in 32 European countries, with almost completely overlapping estimates of transmission reductions associated with closures in early years settings, primary schools and secondary schools; and equally null effects for each setting associated with reopenings. Yang et al 48 (moderate risk of bias) reported that school closures in US counties (presumed primary and secondary combined) were associated with 37% (95% CI 33% to 40%) reductions in R, compared with 31% reductions for early years settings (95% CI 26% to 35%).\n"," Two studies reported staggered reopenings of different school settings, generally with younger children students returning first, and a week or two between each reopenings. Both studies found null effects on transmission overall, and therefore did not report any differential effect by setting type. Stage et al 44 Beesley 16 (critical risk of bias) noted that increases in the 7-day rolling average of new cases were greater in the 40 days after secondary school reopening than they were in the 24 days following primary schools reopening. However, this study is at high risk of confounding from other NPIs, and it is not clear why the chosen (and different) lag periods were applied.\n"," We identified 40 studies that provided a quantitative estimate of the impact of school closures or reopening on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The studies included a range of countries and were heterogenous in design. Among higher quality, less confounded studies of school closures, 6 out of 14 reported that school closures had no effect on transmission, 6 reported that school closures were associated with reductions in transmission, and 2 reported mixed findings (figure 2); with findings ranging from no association to a 60% relative reduction in incidence and mortality rate. 14 Most studies of school reopening reported that school reopening, with extensive infection prevention and control measures in place and when the community infection levels were low, did not increase community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n"," The strength of this study is that it draws on empirical data from actual school closures and reopenings during the COVID-19 pandemic and includes data from 150 countries. By necessity, we include observational rather than randomised controlled studies, as understandably no jurisdictions have undertaken such trials. We were unable to meta-analyse due to study heterogeneity. We were unable to meaningfully examine differences between primary and secondary schools as very few studies distinguished between them, despite the different transmission patterns for younger and older children. Data are also lacking from low-income countries, where sociocultural factors may produce different effects of school closures on transmission to high-income settings, leaving a substantial gap in the evidence base. Data in these studies come exclusively from 2020, and many studies report only up to the summer months, it is therefore unclear whether our findings are robust to the effects of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccines.\n"," A major challenge with estimating the 'independent' effect of school closures, acknowledged by many of the studies, is disentangling their effect from other NPIs occurring at the same time. While most studies tried to account for this, it is unclear how effective these methods were. Even where adjustment occurred there is a risk of residual confounding, which likely overestimated preventative associations; and collinearity (highly correlated independent variables meaning that is impossible to estimate specific effects for each) which could bias results towards or away from the null. One exception was a paper by Matzinger and Skinner, 37 which focused on three US states that implemented school closures first and without co-interventions, and reported a twofold increase in the time for cases to double 1 week after school closures. However, it is possible that the benefits observed here may be attributable, at least in part, to a 'signalling effect' with other changes to social mobility (eg, working from home) being prompted by school closures. Another approach, although ineligible for inclusion in our study, is to examine transmission data for breakpoints, and then work backwards to see what NPIs were in place at the time. Two studies that did this found that transmission started to drop following other NPIs, before school closures were implemented, and found no change in the gradient of decline after school closures in Switzerland 55 and Germany. 56 This may suggest school closures have different effects when implemented first, or on top of other restrictions, perhaps due to a broader signalling effect that the first implemented NPI has on societal mobility patterns. The true independent effect of school closures from the first wave around the world may simply be unknowable.\n"," In contrast, lifting of NPIs in the summer of 2020 (including school reopenings) generally occurred in a more staggered way, and on a background of stable testing regimes and outcome ascertainment. Good-quality observational studies considering data from across 32 European countries, 24 Germany alone 28 and the USA 25 all demonstrated that school reopenings can be successfully implemented without increasing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, where baseline incidence is low and robust infection prevention and control measures are in place.\n"," This finding is in keeping with several studies showing little or no effect of school reopening on intraschool transmission rates. 6 57 58 However, the US-based study did comment that those counties with the highest 25% of baseline hospitalisations at the time of reopenings (above 40 admissions per 100 000 population per week) did see an increase in transmission following school reopenings, although the bottom 75% of counties did not see any effect. This may explain why the other school reopening study at lower risk of bias 35 reported a clear, although non-significant, trend towards school reopenings being associated with increases in transmission rates across 131 countries worldwide, with the authors noting \"we were unable to account for different precautions regarding school reopening that were adopted by some countries\" before citing Israel as an example where an uptick in transmission occurred following reopening, and where 'students were in crowded classrooms and were not instructed to wear face masks'.\n"," The variability in findings from our included studies are likely to reflect issues with study design. However, this may also suggest that there is no single effect of school closures and reopenings on community transmission and that contextual factors modify the impact of closures in different countries and over time. If the purpose of school closures is reduction in social contacts among children, the level of social mixing between children that occurs outside school once schools are closed is likely to be a key determinant of their effect at reducing community transmission. This will be influenced by other NPIs, and other key contextual factors including background prevalence of infection, use of preventive measures in schools prior to closures, age of children affected as well as sociodemographic and cultural factors.\n"," Different countries have adopted different approaches to controlling COVID-19. Early in the pandemic school closures were common, and in some places were one of the first major social distancing measures introduced. The effectiveness of the overall bundle of lockdown measures implemented is proven, but the incremental benefit of school closures remains unclear. In contrast, only one of the four studies of school reopenings assessed at a lower risk of bias reported an increase in community transmission. Collectively, the evidence around school reopenings, while more limited in size, tends to suggest that school reopenings, when implemented during periods of low incidence and accompanied by robust preventive measures, are unlikely to have a measurable impact on community transmission. Further research is needed to validate these findings and their generalisability, including with respect to new variants. These findings are highly important given the harmful effects of school closures. 3 4 Policymakers and governments need to take a measured approach before implementing school closures in response to rising infection rates, and look to reopen schools, with appropriate mitigation measures in place, where other lockdown measures have successfully brought community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.

Virus\n","Body Text: Coronaviridae, causing serious economic losses to the poultry industry (Cavanagh, 2007) . IBV has many genotypes and serotypes circulating in poultry farms leading to continuous outbreaks of infectious bronchitis (IB) disease (Bijlenga et al., 2004) . IBV is an enveloped virus with a single stranded unsegmented positive sense RNA genome of about 27 kb size. The IBV virion is made up of spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), nucleoprotein (N), envelope protein (E), and genomic RNA (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . Spike protein determines the IBV tropism and can be cleaved into the two subunits: S1 and S2 by host furin protein (Cavanagh et al., 1992; Casais et al., 2003) . The S1 subunit is responsible for binding to the cell surface receptor, while S2 is responsible for fusion of viral envelope and cellular membrane (Luo and Weiss, 1998; Belouzard et al., 2012) .\n"," Interaction between virus protein and cellular receptor is the first step for virus infection (Smith and Helenius, 2004) . Different coronaviruses use different cell surface molecules to gain entry into the target cells. For instance, Aminopeptidase N (APN) is the receptor for H229E, TGEV, and PDCoV (Delmas et al., 1992; Breslin et al., 2003; Wang and Huang, 2019) ; MHV utilizes CEACAM1 as receptor (Williams et al., 1991) ; ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003) and recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (Wan et al., 2020) ; DPP4 is the receptor for MERS-CoV (Raj et al., 2013) . Meanwhile, besides cellular receptors, other co-factors in the cell membrane may also influence virus binding. For example, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP-78) is an important attachment factor for MERS-CoV infection of host cells (Chu et al., 2018) . Calcium dependent (C-type) lectins play a role during SARS-CoV and FCoV infection (Belouzard et al., 2012) .\n"," Though IBV was the first coronavirus discovered, study of its host cell receptor goes slowly. Previous studies showed that α-2,3 sialic acid and heparan sulfate (HS) were binding molecules for IBV onto the host cells (Winter et al., 2006; Madu et al., 2007) . Recently, Wang et al. reported that IBV entered the cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis . The N terminal 253 amino acids of the mature S1 subunit of IBV-M41 (aa 19-272 of the S1 precursor) has been identified as a receptor binding domain (RBD) (Promkuntod et al., 2014) . However, the functional receptor for IBV infection is still unknown. In this study, we attempt to identify molecules on host cell membrane responsible for IBV infection. Using immunoprecipitation assay and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified heat shock protein member 8 (HSPA8) as a host cell molecule involved in IBV infection. HSPA8 is a member of HSP70 family and is also referred to as HSP71. It is a conserved protein among different species during evolution (Stricher et al., 2013) . A large number of cellular functions have been attributed to HSPA8 (Liu et al., 2012) . Previous research showed that HSPA8 can exist in cell membrane and has a role in binding to cell surface by several viruses such as Rotavirus and Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1 (Sagara et al., 1998; Guerrero and Moreno, 2012) . Our results suggest that HSPA8 plays a role during initial stages of IBV infection.\n"," Chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells were prepared from 17 to 19 day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 • C in 5% CO 2 atmosphere.

CEK cells cultured in 6-well plates were incubated with GST-HSPA8treated virus and GST-treated virus at 4 • C for 1 h. After the incubation, the cells were harvested after 3 washes with PBS. Cell-associated viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR which indicated the degree of inhibition of virus binding on the host cells caused by recombinant HSPA8. IBV-Beaudette strain (moi = 10) was incubated with recombinant GST-HSPA8 (100 µg) protein and control protein GST (100 µg) at 37 • C for 1 h. Before addition of virus to the Vero cells, 400 µl of heparanase I (5 mIU/ml) was added to the cells and incubated at 37 • C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were then incubated with GST-HSPA8-treated virus and GST-treated virus at 4 • C for 1 h. After incubation, the cells were harvested after 3 washes with PBS. Cell-associated viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR which indicated the inhibition level of recombinant HSPA8 on IBV Beaudette binding to the Vero cells.\n"," CEK cells were cultured in 6-well plates, and incubated with polyclonal antibody against HSPA8 (2 µg, 2µl/well or 4 µg, 4µl/well) and rabbit-IgG (4 µg, 4 µl/well) at 37 • C for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with IBV M41 (TCID 50 = 10 6 . 5 /ml, 50 µl/well) at 4 • C for 1 h, after three washes with PBS, the cells were then transferred to incubate at 37 • C for 1 h or 24 h.

To address this question, the IBV-M41 strain was passaged in CEK cells to get a CEK culture adapted IBV M41 virus strain. As showed by Western blot analysis of the viral proteins, the expression level of S1 protein of IBV M41 reached a peak at 36 h post-infection (Figure 1A) , which was selected as the optimal time point for preparation of immunoprecipitated S protein in the following experiments. Western blot analysis showed that the membrane proteins could be efficiently extracted with membrane protein extraction kit as the extracted proteins could react with antibody to membrane protein marker HSP90AB1 but not with antibodies to a cytoplasmic protein (GAPDH) and a nuclear protein (Histone3) (Figure 1E) .\n"," To identify membrane proteins that may interact with IBV spike protein, immunoprecipitation assay was performed with membrane proteins from IBV M41-CEK infected cells using mAb 1H1 to IBV spike protein and mouse IgG. Immunoprecipated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE before silver staining ( Figure 1B) . A specific protein band with molecular weight of 70 kDa (arrow) was visualized by silver staining in 1H1 immunoprecipitates from infected cells (Figure 1B, lane 3) , but not from uninfected cells (not shown). IBV S protein around 170 kDa and its S1 subunit around 100 kDa were detected by Western blot analysis with mAb 1H1 to IBV M41 S1 (Figure 1C , red arrows). The 70 kDa specific protein band ( Figure 1B , lane 3, arrow) which was pulled down by mAb to S1 (1H1) but not by the control antibody was excised and sent for LC-MS/MS analysis. The MS result revealed that the specific 70 kDa band was heat shock protein member 8 (HSPA8), also known as heat shock protein 71. The full length sequence of putative chicken HSPA8 is 647 amino acid in size ( Figure 1D) . Chicken HSPA8 could be detected from whole cell lysates and membrane extracts of CEK cells ( Figure 1E ).\n"," To verify whether HSPA8 is expressed on the cell surface, we performed indirect flow cytometry assay without cell permeabilization. As results shown in Figures 2A,C,E, HSPA8 was found to be expressed on the surface of 293T, Vero and CEK cells. Additionally, the expression was also confirmed by Western blot analysis with mAb to HSPA8 (Figures 2B,D,F) .\n"," Furthermore, we checked the expression of HSPA8 in chicken tissues by RT-qPCR. The results showed that HSPA8 was found to be expressed in the tissues of kidney, liver, heart and lung of 1-day-old chickens with highest expression level in kidneys ( Figure 2G) . Detection of the interaction between HSPA8 and IBV M41 spike protein in M41-infected CEK cells by immunoprecipitation assay using mAb 1H1 to IBV S and mouse IgG. IBV S1 and HSPA8 in precipitates were detected by immunoblots with mAbs to IBV S1 and HSPA8. (B) Detection of the interaction between HSPA8 and IBV M41-RBD by co-IP assay using HSPA8 as bait protein. 293T cells were cotransfected with indicated plasmids and then flag-tagged HSPA8 was immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibody.

The precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-flag and anti-GFP antibodies. (D,E) Identification of the direct interaction between HSPA8 and IBV M41-RBD by GST-pull-down assay. In (D), GST and GST-M41-RBD recombinant proteins were separately bound to glutathione-sepharose beads and then incubated with His-HSPA8 recombinant protein. The protein complexes were detected by Western blot analysis with antibodies against GST and 6xHis. In (E), The lysates of 293T cells transfected with EGFP-C3-M41-RBD vector were incubated with GST or GST-HSPA8 protein which was separately bound to glutathione-sepharose beads. Subsequently, the protein complexes were detected by Western blot analysis with antibodies against GST and GFP.\n"," To further verify the interaction between IBV M41 spike protein and HSPA8 of host cell, we performed immunoprecipitation assay with mAb 1H1 to spike protein in M41 infected CEK cells. As shown in Figure 3A , HSPA8 could be immunoprecipated with IBV spike protein, but not with mouse IgG. These results indicated that HSPA8 could interact with IBV spike protein. To examine whether HSPA8 interacts with spike protein through the RBD, we performed co-IP assay with lysates of transfected cells. As shown in Figure 3B , M41-RBD specifically immunoprecipitated with HSPA8, but not with the empty vector control. To further confirm the interaction between HSPA8 and M41-RBD, reciprocal co-IP was performed using M41-RBD as bait protein. The results showed that HSPA8 could be immunoprecipitated with M41-RBD, but not with the empty vector control (Figure 3C) .\n"," Next, in vitro GST-pull-down assay was also performed to further confirm the direct interaction between HSPA8 and M41-RBD. The results indicated that HSPA8 could specifically interact with M41-RBD, but not with the control GST protein (Figures 3D,E) .\n"," Binding blocking assay was performed using recombinant HSPA8 as competitor to confirm its role in IBV infection. As shown in Figure 4A , the amount of viral RNA associated with cells following incubation at 4 • C with virus pre-incubated with HSPA8 was less than the amount of viral RNA associated with cells incubated with virus pre-incubated with GST protein.\n"," In addition, an inhibition assay was also performed to check whether antibody to HSPA8 could inhibit IBV M41 infection of CEK cells. As shown in Figures 4B,C, infection of IBV was significantly reduced in anti HSPA8 polyclonal antibody pretreated cells at both 1 hpi and 24 hpi. A similar result was also observed in Western blot analysis at 24hpi FIGURE 4 | Inhibition of IBV M41 binding to CEK cells by binding blocking assay and infection inhibition assay. (A) Recombinant HSPA8 blocked the binding of IBV M41 to CEK cells. IBV M41 (TCID 50 = 10 6.5 /ml, 200 µl) was incubated with recombinant protein GST-HSPA8 (100 µg) and control recombinant protein GST (100 µg) at 37 • C for 1 h. CEK cells cultured in 6-well plates was incubated with GST-HSPA8-treated virus and GST-treated virus at 4 • C for 1 h. After 1 h incubation, the cells were harvested after 3 washes with PBS. The viral RNA associated with cells was determined by RT-qPCR. (B-E) Anti HSPA8 antibody inhibited IBV infection in CEK cells. CEK cells were cultured in 6-well plates and incubated with polyclonal antibody against HSPA8 (2 µg, 2 µl/well or 4 µg, 4 µl/well) and rabbit-IgG (4 µg, 4 µl/well) at 37 • C for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with IBV M41 virus (TCID 50 = 10 6.5 /ml, 50 µl/well) at 4 • C for 1 h then incubated at 37 • C. Cells were harvested after 3 washes with PBS at 1 hpi (B) and 24 hpi (C,D). The inhibition level was determined by RT-qPCR (B,C) and Western-blotting (D). Virus titer in culture supernatant at 24 hpi was determined by TCID 50 assay (E). Data shown in this figure represent those from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ns (nonsignificant), P > 0.05.\n"," Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org ( Figure 4D ). Virus titer in infected cell culture supernatant at 24 hpi from the anti HSPA8 polyclonal antibody pretreated cells was lower than in that from control antibody pretreated cells ( Figure 4E) . Previous studies have shown that expression of functional cellular receptor in nonpermissive cells could make the cell susceptible to virus infection Wang and Huang, 2019) . However, IBV M41 could not be passaged in an HSPA8-overexpressing cell line (Supplementary Figure 1) .\n"," HSPA8 Interacts With the N-Terminal 19-272 Amino Acids of S1 of Other IBV Strains and M41-RBD Interacts With HSPA8 of Human and Pig Apart from the M41-RBD, we also performed similar experiments with the N-terminal 19-272 amino acids of the S1 subunit of other IBV strains. The results showed that the HSPA8 could interact with the N-terminal 19-272 amino acids of S1 of IBV Beaudette, H120 and QX strains (Figures 5A-C) .\n"," Surprisingly, HSPA8 from human and pig also interacted with M41-RBD as indicated by co-IP assay ( Figure 5D ).\n"," IBV-Beaudette strain could bind to heparan sulfate (HS) through its HS binding site in S2 subunit (Madu et al., 2007) . To exclude the influence of HS on the surface of Vero cells for IBV Beaudette binding, heparanase I was used to remove HS on the surface of Vero cells. As shown in Figure 6A , the viral RNA associated with cells was significantly reduced in heparanase I-pretreated cells compared to the control cells. These results indicated that pretreatment with heparanase I could inhibit IBV Beaudette binding to Vero cells. Further, the importance of HSPA8 in IBV-Beaudette strain infection was also studied by binding blocking assay and infection inhibition assay after removal of HS with heparanase I. As shown in Figure 6B , when HS was removed, recombinant HSPA8 was able to block IBV Beaudette strain binding to Vero cells. In the case of infection inhibition assay, FIGURE 5 | HSPA8 interacts with the N-terminal 19-272 amino acids of S1 subunit of IBV Beaudette, H120 and QX strains and M41-RBD interacts with HSPA8 of human and pig. (A-C) Detection of interaction between chicken HSPA8 and the N-terminal 19-272 amino acids of the S1 subunit of Beaudette (A), H120 (B), and QX (C) strains. 293T cells were cotransfected with indicated plasmids and then flag-tagged HSPA8 was immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibody. The precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-flag and anti-GFP antibodies. (D) Detection of the interaction between IBV M41-RBD and HSPA8 of human and pig. 293T cells were cotransfected with indicated plasmids and then flag-tagged HSPA8 was immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibody. The precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-flag and anti-GFP antibodies. the amount of viral RNA was significantly reduced in HSPA8 antibody pretreated cells compared to the control IgG pretreated cells (Figures 6C,D) . Similar result was observed in Western blot analysis which showed that infection of IBV was significantly inhibited by HSPA8 antibody compared to the control IgG ( Figure 6E ). Virus titer in infected cell culture supernatant from the anti HSPA8 antibody pretreated cells was also lower than control antibody pretreated cells (Figure 6F ).\n"," In this study, we performed immunoprecipitation assay with membrane proteins from IBV M41 infected CEK cells and found that HSPA8 was involved in the interaction of host cell membrane and IBV spike protein (Figure 1) . Then, we confirmed the expression of HSPA8 on the plasma membrane of different cell types by indirect flow cytometry assay (Figures 2A,C,E) , and by Western blot analysis (Figures 2B,D,F) . The result of immunoprecipitation and prevalence of HSPA8 on host cell membrane suggested its putative role during initial stages of virus infection. Interestingly, the expression level of HSPA8 in kidney and lung tissues of chicken is higher compared to other organs ( Figure 2G) . These results suggest that HSPA8 might be involved in tissue tropism of IBV infection in chicken, considering that IBV infection usually causes respiratory distress and kidney damage.\n"," RBD of coronavirus S1 protein is primarily responsible for virus interaction with host cells. The N-terminal 19-272 amino acids of the S1 subunit of IBV-M41 was identified as a RBD (Promkuntod et al., 2014) . We found that HSPA8 directly interacted with the RBD of IBV M41-spike protein as confirmed by GST-pull-down assay (Figure 3) . Furthermore, HSPA8 also interacted with the RBD-associated N-terminal 19-272 amino acids region of the S1 subunit of IBV Beaudette, H120 and QX strains (Figure 5) . Binding blocking assay and infection Before infection, 400 µl of heparinase I at different concentration (0, 2, 5 mIU/ml) was added to Vero cells at 37 • C for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with IBV Beaudette strain (moi = 1) at 4 • C for 1 h. After incubation, the cells were harvested after 3 washes with PBS. The viral RNA associated with cells was determined by RT-qPCR. (B) Recombinant HSPA8 blocked the binding of IBV Beaudette to Vero cells. IBV Beaudette (moi = 10) was incubated with recombinant protein GST-HSPA8 (100 µg) or control protein GST (100 µg) at 37 • C for 1 h and then added to Vero cells pretreated with 400 µl of heparanase I (5 mIU/ml) and incubated at 4 • C for 1 h. The cells were harvested after 3 washes with PBS. The viral RNA associated with cells was quantified by RT-qPCR. (C-F) Anti-HSPA8 antibody inhibited IBV-Beaudette infection of Vero cells. Vero cells pretreated with 400 µl of heparanase I (5 mIU/ml) were incubated with polyclonal antibody against HSPA8 (2 µg, 2 µl/well or 4 µg, 4 µl/well) and rabbit-IgG (4 µg, 4 µl/well) at 37 • C for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with IBV Beaudette strain (moi = 1) at 4 • C for 1 h then incubated at 37 • C. Cells were harvested after 3 washes with PBS at 1 hpi (C) and 24 hpi (C,D). The inhibition level was quantified by RT-qPCR (C,D) and Western-blotting (E). Virus titer in culture supernatant at 24 hpi was determined by TCID 50 assay (F). Data shown in this figure represent those from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ns (nonsignificant), P > 0.05. inhibition assay showed that recombinant HSPA8 protein and antibody against HSPA8 could inhibit the infection of IBV M41 and Beaudette strains in CEK and Vero cells, respectively (Figures 4, 6) . These results indicate that HSPA8 acts as a target molecule on host cell membrane for IBV spike protein and is involved in IBV infection.\n"," However, HSPA8 overexpression in the nonpermissive cells did not facilitate IBV infection (Supplementary Figure 1) and the HSPA8 antibody did not completely abolish the infection of IBV of the host cells. Considering that many binding molecules on the cell surface are involved in coronavirus infection using different strategies, we hypothesize that the HSPA8 might act as an attachment factor during the IBV infection.\n"," It has been widely known that HSPA8 has multiple functions including as a receptor for virus infection (Sagara et al., 1998; Guerrero and Moreno, 2012) . In this study, for the first time, HSPA8 was found to play a role in IBV infection. Zhang et al. (2017) identified HSP70 protein, one of the members of HSP70 family, as a part of the receptor complex for IBV. HSP70, which acts as a receptor associated protein, is different from previously identified carbohydrate like receptors such as α-2, 3 sialic acid, and HS, suggesting that IBV could exploit both protein and carbohydrate molecules alike to gain entry into the target cells. HSPA8 and HSP70 both belong to the HSP70 family and their amino acid sequences share 86% identity. Thus, it is quite possible that HSPA8 exhibits similar function as HSP70 during IBV infection.\n"," HS has been reported to co-localize with heat shock protein (HSP) 90 (Snigireva et al., 2015) . To check whether HS on cell membrane may have influenced IBV S protein binding to HSPA8, we performed the binding blocking assay and infection inhibition assay based on removal of HS by using heparanase. The results showed that the recombinant HSPA8 and antibody to HSPA8 could still block/inhibit IBV infection of host cells, suggesting that HSPA8 plays a role during IBV infection independent from HS (Figures 6B-F) .\n"," In this study, we found that unglycosylated RBD which was expressed in E. coli could interact with HSPA8. Recent studies showed that the glycosylation of IBV M41-RBD is essential for its binding to chicken tracheal tissue and the removal of the glycosylation modification site of RBD may affect IBV binding to host cells (Parsons et al., 2019; Bouwman et al., 2020) . Considering that HSPA8 is not a functional receptor for IBV and the importance of glycosylation of RBD for binding to host cells, we speculate that unglycosylated RBD might not act like glycosylated RBD to interact with more host molecules. On the other hand, IBV S1 RBD tends to bind sialylated glycan receptor on the surface of host cells (Bouwman et al., 2020) , and it has been reported that HSPA8 could also be glycosylated (Guinez et al., 2010) , therefore the glycosylation of HSPA8 may increase the possibility for IBV binding to the host cells.\n"," Finally, in this study, HSPA8 from human and pig was also found to interact with M41-RBD (Figure 5D) , and sequence analysis showed that the similarity of amino acid sequence among HSPA8 of human, pig and chicken was more than 96%, indicating that the role of HSPA8 on coronavirus binding might be conserved among different host species.\n"," Taken together, our results suggest that HSPA8 plays an important role during initial stage of IBV infection. The identification of HSPA8 as an attachment factor for IBV infection will increase our understanding of the mechanism of IBV pathogenesis.\n"," All datasets generated for this study are included in the article/Supplementary Material.\n"," The animal study was reviewed and approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal of Zhejiang University (ZJU20170388).\n"," ML, JZ, and PZ designed the experiments.

This disease is characterized by fibrinous polyserositis, arthritis, meningitis, and frequent symptoms of pneumonia, which often occur in pigs under stress or infected with other pathogens [1] . Although 15 serovars have been identified, 26.2% of the isolated strains cannot be typed [2] . Serovar 5 is thought to be highly virulent, and epidemiological studies have shown that it is the most prevalent in China [2, 3] .\n"," To date, the prevention and control of Glässer's disease have mainly focused on the application of antibiotics and vaccines. Misuse of antibiotics has led to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and the rate of AMR in bacteria has increased from 2008 to 2017 in China [4, 5] . AMR is also a serious threat to animal and public health, and international policies are demanding a reduction in their use, especially in the farming industry [6] . In this context, vaccination has become a better plan to prevent Glässer's disease. However, there is a problem with the existing vaccines, which can provide good homologous protection but heterologous protection has been variable [7] .\n"," Screening of immunodominant antigens is key to designing a targeted immune response against virulent G. parasuis [8] . Tadjine [9] used the G. parasuis serovar 4 strain as an immunogen to prepare two mAbs. Among them, mAb 4D5 recognizes the epitope of the outer membrane protein, and mAb 4G9 recognizes the epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. Through passive immunization protection experiments, they found that the two mAbs can provide immune protection in mice. Tian et al. [10] also used inactivated whole bacteria of the local isolate HLJ-018 to immunize BALB/c mice, and mAb 1D8 against the outer membrane protein OmpA was obtained. mAb 1D8 with opsonization can react with 1-15 serovars of G. parasuis and protect mice from homologous and heterologous G. parasuis strains. Many studies have shown that lipopolysaccharides and outer membrane proteins are virulence-related factors of bacteria and have strong immunogenicity [11] .\n"," In this study, the G. parasuis reference serovar 5 strain (G. parasuis-5) was inactivated to immunize BALB/c mice to prepare six mAbs. By mass spectrometry analysis, three proteins were identified and expressed, and the specific antigen targeted by mAb 2D1 was confirmed as Fe(3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein through Western blot analysis. The characterization and protective activity of mAb 2D1 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Using mAb 2D1, we first indicate that Fe(3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein could be a promising novel candidate for subunit vaccine development, which will lay a theoretical foundation for the immunological prevention and treatment of Glässer's disease.\n"," Fifteen reference serovars of G. parasuis (Additional file 1), SP2/0 cells, and 3D4/21 cells were kept by our laboratory. Polyclonal antibodies against G. parasuis-5 (positive serum prepared by immunizing rabbits) and mAb against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae ApxIV (mAb ApxIV) were preserved in our laboratory. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Science Cell. HAT (Hypoxantin, Aminopterin, Thymidin), HT (Hypoxantin, Thymidin), PEG4000, and Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvants were all purchased from Sigma Biological Company. Eight-week-old female BALB/c and ICR mice were purchased from Shanghai Xipuer-Bikai Experimental Animal Co., Ltd. All animal assays were performed in the Laboratory Animal Center of Nanjing Agricultural University and were approved by the Department of Science and Technology of Jiangsu Province [permit number: SCXK (SU) 2012-0004].\n"," Eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized with G. parasuis-5 (1 × 10 9 CFU, inactivated with 0.3% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 24 h) three times at 2-week intervals. The immunization route consisted of multiple subcutaneous injections on the back. An intraperitoneal booster with the same dose of antigen was administered 3 days before fusion. The antibody levels of mice were examined by indirect ELISA. The mouse with the highest antibody titer was selected for cell fusion according to conventional methods [12] . The culture supernatants were also identified by indirect ELISA. The positive hybridomas were subcloned three or more times by limiting dilution. Ascites fluid was produced by intraperitoneal injection of positive hybridoma cells in liquid paraffin-treated BALB/c mice (8-week-old female BALB/c mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 500 μL of sterile liquid paraffin). Subtype classes of mAbs were identified using a Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Isotype ELISA Kit (Proteintech, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n"," In brief, the microtiter plate (96-well, Corning, USA) was coated with 100 µL of inactivated G. parasuis-5 (2.24 × 10 8 CFU/mL) at 37 °C for 2 h and then placed overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the plates were washed 3 times with phosphate buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and placed at 37 °C with 5% skim milk (PBST as diluent) for 2 h. Next, the plates were washed three times. Supernatant of hybridioma culture was added to the wells and kept at 37 °C for 1 h (100 μL/well). At the same time, the sera from immunized and nonimmunized mice served as either positive or negative controls. After washing, 100 μL of goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (H+L) antibody (diluted at 1:250, Shanghai Biyuntian Biotechnology Co., Ltd) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The color was developed by the addition of 100 μL of TMB for 10 min and stopped by the addition of 2 M H 2 SO 4 . Finally, an optical density of 450 nm (OD 450 ) was recorded using an ELISA plate reader (BioTek, USA). When the ratio of the positive value (P) to the negative value (N) is greater than 2.1 (P/N > 2.1), it can be judged as a positive sample.\n"," Indirect ELISA was also carried out to detect the reactivity of six mAbs with 1-15 reference strains of G. parasuis. Microtiter plates were coated with 100 µL of inactivated 1-15 reference strains of G. parasuis as antigens. Six mAbs and positive or negative controls were used as primary antibodies, and goat anti-mouse IgM/ HRP antibody (Beijing Boaosen Biotechnology Co., Ltd) was used as the secondary antibody. Other operations were as described above.\n"," Sterile coverslips were placed into the bottom of 24-well plates and then inoculated with 3D4/21 cells (60% cell well confluency). Each cell well was inoculated with G. parasuis-5 at a dose of 400 MOI, and the cell plate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h [13] . After washing 3 times with PBS, the infected cells on the coverslip were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Six mAbs were used as the primary antibodies, and goat anti-mouse IgM/FITC antibody (Beijing Boaosen Biotechnology Co., Ltd) was used as the secondary antibody. After washing with PBS for 3 times, the coverslips were placed upside down on clean glass slides dripped with 10 μL of 50% glycerol, and they were mounted and observed under a laser confocal microscope (LSM780, Zeiss, USA).\n"," Bacteria were labeled with a CFDA-SE cell proliferation and tracer detection kit (Shanghai Biyuntian Biotechnology Co., Ltd). The labeled bacterial solution was observed under a fluorescence microscope to check whether the bacteria were labeled with fluorescence. After confirmation, FSC and SSC were used to set up gates to delineate the area of the target bacteria in the scatter diagram. G. parasuis-5 cultured to the logarithmic phase was washed 3 times with PBS and then resuspended and fixed with formaldehyde for 20 min at 25 °C. The bacterial pellet was blocked with PBS containing 5% (v/v) skimmed milk for 0.5 h. Then, mAbs were added to bacterial pellets and incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h. Goat anti-mouse IgM/FITC was added and incubated at 37 °C for another 1 h. Subsequently, the bacterial pellet was washed 3 times and resuspended in 300 μL of PBS for FCM analysis (CYTO FLUX, Beckman, USA).\n"," Western blot analysis was used to identify proteins that specifically reacted with mAb 2D1. Whole bacterial proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with PBST containing 5% skimmed milk for 2 h. mAb 2D1 was used as the primary antibody, and goat anti-mouse IgM/HPR was used as the secondary antibody. After four washes with PBST, the membranes were treated with Pierce ECL Western blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and observed with the Tanon Chemiluminescent Imaging System (Biotanon, China).\n"," Protein mass spectrometry was used to analyze the suspected target protein against mAb 2D1. After separating the bacterial proteins with 12.5% SDS-PAGE, the target protein band in the gel was cut out carefully and then sent to Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co., LTD., Guangzhou, for full spectrum analysis. According to the results of mass spectrometry, three proteins were selected for E. coli expression. Western blot experiments (the steps were the same as before) were carried out to identify the target protein of mAb 2D1.\n"," To obtain GAPDH, Fe(3+) ABC transporter substratebinding protein and porin fusion proteins, three pairs of primers (Table 1 ) were used to amplify the full-length sequences of GAPDH, Fe(3+) ABC transporter substratebinding protein and porin genes from G. parasuis-5. The amplified fragments of GAPDH and Fe(3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein were cloned into the pET-28a(+) expression vector, and the amplified porin fragment was cloned into the pET-32a(+) expression \n"," The complement killing assay was modified from previously published protocols [10] . G. parasuis-5 cultured to the logarithmic phase was diluted to 10 3 CFU/mL and incubated with mAb 2D1 (complement-inactivated at 56 °C for 0.5 h) for 0.5 h at 37 °C. Positive serum against G. parasuis-5, PBS and mAb ApxIV were used as positive, mock and negative controls, respectively. Then, guinea pig serum (5%, v/v, undetected antibodies against G. parasuis, Shanghai Yuanye Biotechnology Co., Ltd) was added to the above four mixtures as a source of complement. After incubating at 37 °C for 2 h, the mixtures were evenly spread on TSA agarose plates and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Then, the colony numbers were counted. All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated 3 times.\n"," To assess the opsonophagocytic activity of monoclonal antibodies, we performed experiments with slight modifications based on previous reports [14, 15] . Briefly, 3D4/21 cells were seeded into a 12-well plate (approximately 4 × 10 5 cells/well). G. parasuis-5 (10 9 CFU/mL) cultured to logarithmic phase was mixed with complement-inactivated mAb 2D1. After incubating at 37 °C for 0.5 h, the mixtures were added onto cells at 200 MOI. Then, 5% (v/v) guinea pig serum was added to each cell well and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 2 h. Nonspecifically attached bacteria were removed by washing with PBS, and complete growth medium (including 100 U/mL penicillin G and 0.25 mg/mL gentamicin) was added to each cell well. The cell plate was incubated for another 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria. Subsequently, we used double-distilled water to lyse the cells, and lysates were evenly streaked onto TSA agarose plates. At the same time, positive serum, PBS and the mAb ApxIV were used as positive, mock and negative controls, respectively. All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. In addition, we also used RAW264.7 cells to perform the same experiment, and the operation steps were as described above.\n"," Fifteen 6-week-old female ICR mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, with 5 in each group. One hour before the challenge, mAb 2D1, positive serum and mAb ApxIV were injected via the intraperitoneal pathway. Then, each mouse was intraperitoneally injected with 0.2 mL of G. parasuis-5 suspension (8.42 × 10 9 CFU). Mice were observed for 7 days after the challenge. At 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, blood samples were collected from the tail vein of the surviving mice (with sterile operation). After being diluted with sterile PBS, the blood was applied to TSA solid medium and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. At the same time, the survival rate of mice in each group was compared.\n"," GRAPHPAD version 5.01 was used for statistical analysis.\n"," After 3 screening and subcloning cycles, six hybridoma cell lines were obtained for expansion culture. All of them can secrete stable antibodies against G. parasuis-5. The subtypes of the six mAbs were all IgM/κ chains identified by the mouse monoclonal antibody subtype identification kit.\n"," The confocal laser results showed that there was a clear fluorescence reaction in the cell wells after the mAb and G. parasuis-5 were incubated together, and no specific fluorescence was found in the negative control group ( Figure 1A ). This indicates that the six mAbs can all react with G. parasuis-5. The FCM results also verified this conclusion ( Figure 1B) .\n"," The results of indirect ELISA demonstrated that six mAbs can positively react with reference serovars 1-15 of G. parasuis (Additional file 2). In particular, mAb 2D1 had the strongest reaction with bacteria (Figure 2) , and thus, mAb 2D1 was chosen for subsequent experiments.\n"," Western blot analysis showed that the molecular weight of the protein reacting with mAb 2D1 was approximately parasuis-5, six mAbs were added to the cell wells as primary antibodies and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and goat anti-mouse IgM/FITC antibody was used as the secondary antibody. After washing with PBS 3 times, the coverslips were placed upside down on clean glass slides dripped with 10 μL of 50% glycerol and mounted and observed under a laser confocal microscope. Fluorescence was observed in the cell wells with G. parasuis-5 and mAbs 1A12, 3E3, 4C6, 2D1, 3E6, and 4B2, and there was no fluorescence in the cell wells with G. parasuis-5 and the negative control. Scale bar = 5 μm. B G. parasuis-5 cells were labeled with a CFDA-SE cell proliferation and tracer detection kit. FSC and SSC were used to set up the gate to delineate the area of G. parasuis-5 in the scatter diagram. Six mAbs were used as primary antibodies, and goat anti-mouse IgM/FITC was used as the secondary antibody. They were all incubated with G. parasuis-5 and then used for FCM analysis. Fluorescence was observed in G. parasuis-5 incubated with six mAbs, but there was no fluorescence in G. parasuis-5 incubated with the negative control. Figure 3A) . Mass spectrometry showed that GAPDH, Fe(3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein and porin may be the target proteins of mAb 2D1 ( Table 2 ). The SDS-PAGE results showed that all these proteins could be stably expressed ( Figure 3B ). Then, Western blotting was performed to identify proteins targeted by mAb 2D1. The Western blot analysis results showed that mAb 2D1 specifically reacted with Fe(3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein ( Figure 3C ), which indicates that this protein is an immunogen of mAb 2D1.\n"," Compared with the PBS group, the number of colonies in the mixture of G. parasuis with mAb 2D1 was significantly reduced (p < 0.01), which was not significantly different from the positive control group (Figure 4 ). In addition, there was no significant difference between groups treated with PBS and mAb ApxIV. The results showed that mAb 2D1 can activate complement, thereby inhibiting the growth of G. parasuis.\n"," Compared with the PBS group, the G. parasuis serovar 5 strain incubated with mAb 2D1 was significantly phagocytosed by 3D4/21 cells (p < 0.05), which was not significantly different from the positive control group. In addition, there was no significant difference between the groups treated with PBS and the mAb ApxIV ( Figure 5 ). Repeating this experiment with RAW 264.7 cells with stronger phagocytic ability resulted in more significant results (p < 0.01). These results showed that mAb 2D1 can enhance the phagocytosis of phagocytes by G. parasuis-5 through an opsonizing effect.\n"," The results showed that all mice passively immunized with mAb 2D1 and positive serum were protected, while the survival rate of mice passively immunized with mAb ApxIV was 40% ( Figure 6A ). Consistent with the results of the in vivo protection experiment, the mice passively immunized with the mAb ApxIV showed strong levels of bacteremia at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the challenge ( Figure 6B ). At 48 h, the bacteria in the blood of the mAb 2D1 group and positive serum group were completely eliminated. The above results indicate that mAb 2D1 has the ability to clear G. parasuis and provides protection against G. parasuis-5 infection.\n"," One of the applications of monoclonal antibodies is that they can be utilized to discover predominant immunogens. Since the high purity of immune antigens is a key factor in the preparation of monoclonal antibodies, the traditional preparation method of bacterial-related monoclonal antibodies begins with obtaining the required antigen protein. Because of the structural integrity and immunogenicity of inactivated bacteria, inactivated G. parasuis-5 was used to immunize mice and was used as a coated antigen to screen for positive hybridomas by indirect ELISA. mAb 2D1 that reacted with G. parasuis-5 and other 14 serovars of G. parasuis was screened, so it was used to analyze novel and conserved immunogens of G. parasuis.\n"," Using mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis, we identified Fe(3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding TbpA not only has strong immunogenicity and reactogenicity but can also provide beneficial immune protection against homologous bacteria and different serovar strains in the guinea pig model [16, 17] . Another report showed that the afuA gene, which encodes iron ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, has an 80% protection rate against G. parasuis lethal challenge in mice [18] . Fe(3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein also belongs to the iron ABC transporter substrate-binding protein clusters, but to our knowledge, the protective efficacy of this protein of G. parasuis has not previously been reported. Humoral immunity plays a major role in the host's resistance to G. parasuis [19] , and antibodies are an important part of humoral immunity. IgM, a pentamer with multiple antigen-binding sites, is a high-performance antibody. Its sterilization, lysis, phagocytosis and opsonization are all higher than those of IgG [20] . Because mAb 2D1 is an IgM antibody, its effect on opsonization was assessed. When the complement system is activated by the antigen-antibody complex, the complement CD35 (CR1) receptor on the surface of macrophages binds to IgM, which enhances the phagocytosis of antigens [21] . Passive immunization Figure 4 Complement killing activity of mAb 2D1 in vitro. The G. parasuis serovar 5 strain (diluted to 10 3 CFU/mL with PBS) was incubated with mAb 2D1 (complement-inactivated), positive serum against G. parasuis-5 (prepared by immunizing rabbits and preserved in our laboratory), PBS and mAb ApxIV (mAb against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae preserved in our laboratory) at 37 °C for 2 h. The mixtures were evenly streaked onto TSA agar plates. After growth for 24-48 h, colony numbers were measured (one-way ANOVA; Tukey's post hoc test, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, ns indicates no statistically significant difference). . After seeding 3D4/21 or RAW264.7 cells into a 12-well plate (approximately 4 × 10 5 cells/well), G. parasuis-5 (incubated with mAb 2D1 for 0.5 h at 37 °C) was added to cells at 200 MOI, and 5% (v/v) guinea pig serum was added to each cell well. After incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 2 h, complete growth medium (including 100 U/mL penicillin G and 0.25 mg/mL gentamicin) was added to each cell well. The cell plate was incubated for another 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria. At the same time, positive serum against G. parasuis-5, PBS and mAb ApxIV were used as positive and negative controls. Double-distilled water was used to lyse the cells, and lysates were evenly streaked onto TSA agarose plates. After growth overnight, colony numbers were measured (one-way ANOVA; Tukey's post hoc test, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, ns indicates no statistically significant difference).\n"," Passive immunization of mice. A Mice (n = 5) received mAb 2D1 intraperitoneally 1 h prior to the challenge. Mice were then challenged with a 2 × LD 50 dose of 8.42 × 10 9 CFU of G. parasuis by intraperitoneal inoculation. mAb ApxIV was used as a negative control, and positive serum against G. parasuis-5 was used as the positive control. Mice were observed for 7 days after the challenge, and the survival rate of mice in each group was compared. B Blood bacterial loads of ICR mice after lethal challenge were determined in serial dilutions of 20 µL of blood obtained from the tail vein at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postinfection in a sterile environment. After being diluted with sterile PBS, the blood was applied to TSA solid medium and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and the bacterial load in blood was calculated.\n","Score: 3.583079620102173\n","\n","Title: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) moonlights as an adhesin in Mycoplasma hyorhinis adhesion to epithelial cells as well as a plasminogen receptor mediating extracellular matrix degradation\n","Body Text: The cell wall-less members of the Mycoplasma genus are commensal, opportunistic or pathogenic bacteria that can colonize in humans, animals and plants. Various Mycoplasma species are considered pathogenic to swine, including Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma suis and Mycoplasma hyosynoviae [1] . M. hyorhinis is ubiquitous in the pig population and can be found in the respiratory tract of both healthy animals and those showing clinical signs of M. hyorhinis infection. Most colonized pigs show no apparent clinical manifestation of disease. The occurrence of disease is often related to the systemic invasion of the pathogen. Clinical signs vary greatly from server polyserositis, arthritis and lameness, to mild otitis or conjunctivitis [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . In addition to being a pathogen of pigs, M. hyorhinis has also been reported to be linked with human cancer [2, 3] . M. hyorhinis has been detected in cancerous tissues from gastric, esophageal, lung, breast, glioma and colon cancers by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or immunohistochemical staining (IHC) [2] . Antibodies to M. hyorhinis, specifically targeted to the P37 protein, have also been found to bind circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [4, 5] .\n"," Adhesion factors play a vital role in the process of mycoplasma infection and pathogenicity. At present, there are very limited research reports on the adhesion factors of M. hyorhinis. To date, only two adhesion molecules have been identified, these include variable lipoprotein family (Vlp) [6] and the tumor-associated lipoprotein P37 [7] . However other adhesins, colonization factors and pathogenicity mechanisms are yet to be uncovered. As described for several other species of mycoplasma, many endogenous proteins are also expressed on the surface of the cell membrane due to unknown mechanism, and exert the function as adhesion molecules [8] [9] [10] [11] . Among them, the enzymes in the glycolysis pathway are the most common proteins. Due to the absence of a TCA cycle, mycoplasmas often, but not exclusively derive ATP from glycolysis. Its key enzymes such as enolase, GAPDH, fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase have all been reported to have cell adhesion functions and are processed on the cell surface [8, [12] [13] [14] [15] . In addition, these proteins are often found to bind the components of the ECM [16, 17] , extracellular actin [18] and plasminogen [13, 19, 20] .\n"," On the other hand, a variety of mycoplasmas, including M. hyorhinis, are invasive bacteria [21] [22] [23] . A common feature of invasive processes is the degradation of ECM or basement membrane (BM, specialized ECM), which is required for invasive cells to migrate into adjacent tissues or into circulation [24] . Various invasive bacterial pathogens express plasminogen receptors (PlgR) that immobilize plasminogen on its surface. The bound plasminogen is converted to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and initiate a proteolytic cascade that leads to damage to these tissue barriers [24, 25] . Furthermore, bacterial adherence to ECM (including BM) initiated bacterial uptake via the endosomal pathway [26, 27] and directs bacteriuminduced proteolytic activity onto ECM, which facilitates bacterial dissemination through ECM [24, 28] .\n"," GAPDH, which catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-diphosphoglycerate, is a typical moonlighting enzyme. Surface expression and adhesive function have been confirmed for an increasing number of bacteria, including Streptococcus species [29] , Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae [30] , Lactobacillus reuteri [31] , Mycoplasma pneumoniae [12, 16, 32] . The GAPDH of M. pneumoniae has been proved to bind different types of human cells [12, 32] and interact with human plasminogen, vitronectin, fibronectin and fibrinogen [16, 32] . The role of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae GAPDH in adhesion was also strongly implicated by its interaction with actin and other cell-surface associated components [18] .\n"," In the present study, we identified the participation of M. hyorhinis GAPDH in cytoadherence to swine and human cells, interaction with ECM, and its role in hijacking plasminogen/plasmin system to degrade ECM components.\n"," M. hyorhinis strain HEF16 was isolated in our lab from a pig showing typical clinical signs, and grown in KM2 medium (Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China). Escherichia coli strains DH5α and BL21 (DE3) were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on solid media containing 1.5% agarose supplemented with 30 μg/ mL of kanamycin. The pET-28a ( +) expression vector was obtained from Novagen (Merck, Germany).\n"," PK15 cells, a porcine epithelial cell line derived from a normal pig kidney, and NCI-H292 cells, a human airway epithelial cell line derived from a pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS medium was used for cells culture. The cells were maintained in a humidified air with provision of 5% CO2.\n"," The entire GAPDH gene was generated synthetically based on the sequence of strain HUB-1(GenBank, CP002170.1). The sequence was optimized with E. colipreferred codons and two TGA codons were mutated into TGG. The gene was inserted into the pET-28a ( +) vector between the XhoI and BamHI cleavage sites. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21 by chemical transformation (BL21 Chemically Competent Cells, Sigma, USA), identified by PCR with T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers and verified by DNA sequencing (GenScript, China). E. coli cells at log phase were treated with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) with a final concentration of 1 mM for 6 h at 37 ℃ to induce expression. Recombinant protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography (GenScript, China), dialyzed, freeze-dried and stored at −80 °C before use. Protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). For identification, whole cell lysate of E. coli BL21 carrying recombinant vector pET-28a-gapdh before and after induction by IPTG and purified rGAPDH protein were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBST buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20), the membrane was incubated with mouse anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Boster, China), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000, Boster, China). Finally, filters were developed with Electro-Chemi-Luminescence (ECL) substrate using a ChemiDoc XRS + system (Bio-Rad, USA).\n"," Polyclonal antibodies were raised against rGAPDH by subcutaneously immunizing two 1-month-old New Zealand White rabbits which were obtained from a contract farm. Each rabbit was immunized three times with 1 mg of rGAPDH emulsified in Freund's adjuvant (1:1, v/v, Sigma, USA) at 2-week intervals. Antisera were collected at 1 week after the third immunization, and titers were determined by ELISA. The reactivity and specificity of the prepared polyclonal antibody was assessed by Western blotting (Additional file 1).\n"," Flow cytometry analysis was used to detect if GAPDH was located on the surface of M. hyorhinis. In brief, M. hyorhinis (10 8 color change unit (CCU)) were incubated with anti-rGAPDH serum at a 1:100 dilution (preimmune rabbit serum was used as negative control) for 1 h at 37 °C. The blank control was incubated with PBS instead of antibody. M. hyorhinis cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:500 dilutions (Boster, China) for 1 h at 37 °C. The fluorescence intensity was detected using flow cytometer (BD Accuri ® C6). The level of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of M. hyorhinis incubated with anti-rGAPDH serum was expressed as the percentage of that incubated with preimmune serum.\n"," Alternatively, the colony blot technique was used to detect if GAPDH displayed at the surface of M. hyorhinis colonies. PVDF membranes were gently placed on mycoplasma colonies on the surface of agar plates.\n"," After 5 min, filters were removed, blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with TBST buffer containing 5% skim milk, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBST containing 5% skim milk and anti-rGAPDH serum (1:1000 dilution). Filters were washed four times with TBST with an interval of 15 min and treated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10 000; Boster, China) for 1 h at 37 °C.

Preimmune serum was used as a negative control instead of anti-rGAPDH serum.\n"," Binding ability of rGAPDH to human and swine airway epithelial cells PK-15 or NCI-H292 cells were propagated in a 96-well cell plates for 24-36 h. The original medium was removed, and 100 μg of rGAPDH in medium was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h after washing the cells thrice with PBS. Cells incubated with BSA were used as control. Unbound proteins were washed with PBS. The cells were then fixed with cold ethanol for 30 min at 4 °C, and blocked with PBS containing 5% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. The adherence was evaluated by adding anti-rGAPDH monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) followed by Cy3conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Beyotime Biotechnology, China). The cell nuclei were stained with Hoechest 33,342 (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). After washing, the immunofluorescence was detected under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany).\n"," Micro titer plate adhesion assay (MPAA) was conducted in order to quantitatively detect the binding between rGAPDH and cell membrane protein. For this, cell membrane proteins were prepared by a commercial Membrane and Cytosol Protein Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tiangen Biotech, China). A flat-bottom 96-well ELISA plate was coated with 100 μL cell membrane protein (10 μg/mL) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 5% BSA, the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μL of different concentrations (from 1.5 to 100 μg/mL) of rGAPDH protein. PBS was used as control.

After washing, the substrate containing 3,3' ,5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine and H 2 O 2 -urea was added and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, H 2 SO 4 was added to stop the reaction, absorbance was measured at 450 nm. For the adherence inhibition assay, 50 μg/mL of rGAPDH was mixed rabbit anti-rGAPDH serum (1:100 dilution) and added into the microtiter plate. Experiments were performed in triplicate.\n"," Mycoplasma hyorhinis cells (1 × 10 7 CCU/mL) were washed three times with PBS and pre-incubated with polyclonal antibody raised against rGAPDH or preimmune sera (1:100 dilution) at 37 °C for 30 min. Bacteria suspended in RPMI-1640 medium were added to 96-well cell plates containing confluent PK-15 or NCI-H292 cells and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. After washing with PBS to remove nonadherent mycoplasmas, the cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min, and the CCU of mycoplasma were determined. The sample solution (100 μL) was added into 900 μL of medium, the serial ten-fold dilutions were made until a dilution of 10 -11 was achieved. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 14 days. The highest dilution at which color changes was detected and recorded in CCU/mL.

For ELISA, 96-well micro titer plates were coated with 100 μL rGAPDH solution (30 μg/mL) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 5% BSA, the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μL of human plasminogen (10 μg/mL, Sigma, USA) or BSA. After washing with PBST, binding properties were determined by incubating with rabbit anti-plasminogen polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution; Boster, China) followed by HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:10 000 dilution). After washing, the substrate was added and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm.\n"," For Far-Western blotting, a 20 μg sample of rGAPDH was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk, the membrane was incubated with 10 μg/mL plasminogen, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-plasminogen polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) as the primary antibody, and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10 000 dilution) as the secondary antibody. Finally, the membrane was developed with ECL as described above. BSA was used as negative control.\n"," The 96-well micro titers plates were coated with 100 μL rGAPDH solution (30 μg/mL) overnight at 4 ℃. After blocking with 5% BSA, the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μL of human plasminogen (5 μg/mL, Sigma, USA) in the presence or absence of 200 mM lysine analogue, ε-aminocaproic acid (ε-ACA, Sigma, USA). After washing with PBS, 100 μL of tPA (200 ng/ mL, Sigma, USA) was added and the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The plasmin-specific substrate D-valylleucyl-lysine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride (Sigma, USA) was added at a final concentration of 0.4 mM. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and absorbance was read at 405 nm.\n"," To visualize the ECM degradation by scanning electron microscope, the rGAPDH harboring polystyrene beads were used. Conjugation of rGAPDH protein and BSA with polystyrene beads of 1.1 μm mean particle size (Sigma, USA) was performed essentially as described by the manufacturer using the passive absorption procedure. In brief, 20 μL beads were incubated with 1 mL of rGAPDH or BSA solution of 1.5 mg/mL overnight at 4 °C, followed by blocking with BSA (5%). The binding of rGAPDH was detected by anti-His-tag antibody (Data not shown). After washing with PBS, 10 μg/mL plasminogen was added and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by 200 ng/mL tPA. After washing, the beads were resuspended in 1 mL PBS. Matrigel was diluted in ice-cold PBS (1:3) and pipetted on 3-μm filters in Transwell cell culture chamber inserts (Corning, USA). The Matrigel (Corning, USA), a BM preparation from mouse tumor, was allowed to settle at 4 °C for 30 min and was then gelled at 37 °C overnight. The Matrigel was rehydrated in 70 uL PBS for 1 h at 37 °C before proceeding with the degradation assay. The resuspended beads of 70 uL were added into the upper compartment of the Transwell whereas the lower compartment contained 700 uL PBS. The chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 40 h. The filters were gently washed with PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and exanimated in a Zeiss EVO-LS10 scanning electron microscope (Zeiss, Germany).\n"," The 96-well micro titers plate were coated with 100 μL Matrigel, fibronectin, laminin, collagen IV, or BSA solution (10 μg/mL) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 5% BSA, the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μL of rGAPDH protein (12.5-100 μg/mL) or BSA. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with PBST, and the adherence was evaluated by adding 100 μL of mouse anti-His-tag monoclonal antibodies (1:1000), followed by 100 μL of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10 000). After washing, the substrate was added and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The ELISA system was inverted for detecting the binding of rGAPDH to recombinant vitronectin (containing His-tag). rGAPDH or BSA protein of 10 μg/mL were coated, and then vitronectin (1.25-5 μg/mL) were added. The bound vitronectin was detected by rabbit anti-vitronectin monoclonal antibody (1:2000; Boster, China), followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10 000).\n"," Statistical difference was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. The P-values < 0.05 (*) were considered as statistically significant.\n"," The GAPDH gene is very conserved among different strains of M. hyorhinis. Full-length of GAPDH gene, designed based on the genome sequence of strain HUB-1, was synthesized and cloned into the expression vector pET-28a ( +). The rGAPDH expressed in E. coli BL21 in soluble form was induced by IPTG and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The purified rGAPDH was detected by SDS-PAGE as a band around 40 kDa, which corresponds to the size of GAPDH with a His tag ( Figure 1A, lane 3) . The rGAPDH was further identified by Western blotting with anti-His antibody ( Figure 1B , lane 3). Anti-rGAPDH polyclonal antibody was prepared using the purified rGAPDH protein, with a titer of 1: 204 800 detected by ELISA. The antibody specifically reacted with the GAPDH of M. hyorhinis (Additional file 1).\n"," To investigate the cell surface localization of GAPDH on M. hyorhinis, two approaches were used. A flow cytometry analysis showed a significantly higher fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the M. hyorhinis incubated with anti-rGAPDH serum than the M. hyorhinis incubated with the negative serum of the corresponding rabbits (Figure 2A) , which indicated that the surface GAPDH was accessible to the GAPDH-specific antibody. To further confirm the surface localization of GAPDH, colony blot analysis was carried out with agar cultures incubated with anti-rGAPDH serum. The corresponding pre-immune serum was used as the negative control. The anti-rGAPDH serum reacted strongly with the M. hyorhinis colonies, whereas no signals were obtained after incubating with the negative serum ( Figure 2B ).\n"," rGAPDH protein was analyzed for adherence to swine PK15 cells and human NCI-H292 cells. The direct adhesion of rGAPDH to the cells was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 3 , 100 μg of the rGAPDH indicated with red fluorescence significantly adhered to PK-15 and NCI-H292 cells (Figures 3A and C). No adherence was observed for the BSA control ( Figures 3B and D) . For adherence quantification, binding activity of the rGAPDH protein to the cells was assessed by micro titer plate adhesion assay (MPAA). Various dilutions of the rGAPDH solution were added to ELISA wells coated with cell membrane proteins. As shown in Figure 4A , the rGAPDH bound to PK-15 cell membrane proteins in a dose-dependent manner from 3 μg/mL to 100 μg/mL (P < 0.01). A similar pattern was observed when plates were coated with NCI-H292 cell membrane proteins ( Figure 4C ), from 3 μg/ mL to 100 μg/mL (P < 0.01). The binding was inhibited by using antiserum against rGAPDH, but not the negative serum (Figures 4B and D) . \n"," Antibody inhibition assay was performed to further confirm the function of surface-exposed GAPDH in cytoadhesion of M. hyorhinis. The number of M. hyorhinis attached to PK15 Figure 5A ) and NCI-H292 ( Figure 5B ) cells were greatly reduced after being incubated with anti-rGAPDH serum, compared with those of the M. hyorhinis incubated with negative serum (P < 0.01). It was confirmed that surface-localized GAPDH plays an indispensable role in adherence of M. hyorhinis to host cells.\n"," First, ELISA was used to define the ability of rGAPDH to bind plasminogen. Plasminogen was added into the micro titer plates coated with rGAPDH or BSA. After washing, bound plasminogen was detected with polyclonal anti-plasminogen. As shown in Figure 6A , the wells coated with rGAPDH shown significantly increased OD450nm values than those of the wells coated with BSA (P < 0.05), indicating a binding between rGAPDH and plasminogen. To further characterize the specific interaction between GAPDH and plasminogen, Far-Western bolt analysis was conducted. After rGAPDH or BSA was transferred to PVDF membrane, plasminogen was added. After washing, bound plasminogen could be detected with anti-plasminogen antibody at the site corresponding to the band of purified rGAPDH ( Figure 6B ). No obvious interaction between plasminogen and BSA was observed.\n"," Plasminogen-plasmin system plays an important role in bacteria invasion. After confirmation of binding of rGAPDH to plasminogen, we further detected if rGAPDH-bound plasminogen could be activated to plasmin by the activator tPA. ELISA plates were coated with rGAPDH and blocked. After plasminogen and tPA were added successively, proteolytic activity was quantified using a plasmin-specific chromogenic substrate. As shown in Figure 6C , rGAPDH-bound plasminogen was converted to active plasmin by plasminogen activator tPA. The activity was detected with an OD 405 nm of 0.61, significantly higher than that of BSA-coated wells (P < 0.01) and that of wells in the presence of the lysine analogue, ε-ACA (P < 0.01), which not only indicated that rGAPDH-bound plasminogen can be activated but also hinted that plasminogen probably binds to rGAPDH through the lysine residues of the latter.\n"," ECM degradation is critical in the invasion process of bacteria. The basement membrane under the epithelial cells is assumed to be one of the most important physical barriers that restrict M. hyorhinis from breaking through the respiratory tract. We further performed the proteolytic activity test on Matrigel, a complex ECM preparation composed of laminin, type IV collagen, heparansulfate proteoglycan, etc. Basement membrane was reconstituted by Matrigel on the 3-μm filters in Transwell cell culture chamber inserts. rGAPDH or BSAcoated polystyrene beads treated with plasminogen and tPA were added. The degradation of reconstituted basement membrane was analyzed by electron microscopy. The structure of the reconstituted basement membrane is shown in Figure 7 . With the supplementation of plasminogen and tPA, no degradation was observed for the BSA-coated beads (Figures 7C, D) . While significant damage of the reconstituted basement membrane, forming depressions emerged in the in vitro model of ECM membrane treated with rGAPDH-coated beads. The holes in the filter membrane were exposed in some area, where the beads can fall into ( Figures 7A, B) .\n"," ECM components are common host proteins that interact with mycoplasmas. The combination of mycoplasmas to ECM facilitates the subsequent degradation. Here, we evaluated the interaction between rGAPDH and different ECM components to further study which component of ECM is the main receptor for GAPDH binding. By coating Matrigel, fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type IV on micro titer plates (the system was inverted for detecting the binding of rGAPDH to recombinant vitronectin by coating rGAPDH on wells), concentration-dependent binding of rGAPDH to Matrigel and all of the four ECM components were observed (P < 0.01). The binding of rGAPDH with ECM is multiple guaranteed (Figure 8 ).\n"," Mycoplasma hyorhinis is commonly found in pigs, especially in the respiratory tract. The occurrence of disease is often related to the systemic invasion of the pathogen. M. hyorhinis has also been detected in a variety of human tumor tissues, such as gastric, esophageal, lung, breast, glioma and colon cancers [2] . Adhesion to the host cell is the first step in many mycoplasmas infection. Most mycoplasmas lack the classical bacterial toxins; therefore, adhesion molecules are considered to be important virulence-related factors for mycoplasmas, and are often regarded as the main candidate antigens for vaccine development. To date, the Vlp family and P37 proteins are the well-known identified adhesins of M. hyorhinis, the cytoadhesive function of which have been proven in swine respiratory epithelium cells [6] and human gastric cancer cells [7] . However, the pathogenesis and possible virulence factors of M. hyorhinis are not yet fully known, and the exact mechanism by which it adheres to epithelial cells remain to be understood. In the present study, we demonstrated a novel adhesin of M. hyorhinis, GAPDH. GAPDH is originally one of the key canonical glycolytic enzymes, which functions in the cytoplasm. However, it can also be present at the surface of some pathogens, where it plays other roles, including acting as an adhesion molecule, although it lacks special extracellular targeting motifs [29] [30] [31] . The surface location and cytoadhesion function of GAPDH have been reported in three Mycoplasma species, M. pneumoniae [12, 32] , M. hyopneumoniae [18] and Mycoplasma suis [33, 34] . The present study focuses on GAPDH's role as a non-canonical adhesin in M. hyorhinis. The cell-surface display of GAPDH in M. hyorhinis was determined by flow cytometry and colony blot analyses. This suggested that GAPDH has the possibility to interact directly with host cells or components. Furthermore, we demonstrated the adhesion of the GAPDH of M. hyorhinis to two commonly used cell lines, porcine-derived PK-15 cells and humanderived NCI-H292 cells by recombinant protein adhesion and antibody inhibition tests. The data indicated that the GAPDH moonlights as an adhesin on the M. hyorhinis Figure 6 Binding activity of the rGAPDH protein to plasminogen and the activation of the rGAPDH-bound plasminogen to plasmin. A ELISA was performed to characterize the ability of immobilized rGAPDH binding plasminogen. B Far Western blot analysis of binding activity of rGAPDH to plasminogen. Bound plasminogen was determined by anti-plasminogen antibody. BSA was chosen as negative control for non-specific binding. C Plasminogen bound to the coated rGAPDH in microtiters plate was activated to plasmin by tPA. The presence of lysine analogue, ε-ACA decreased the binding of plasminogen to rGAPDH. Activity of plasmin was evaluated by adding chromogenic substrate, and OD405nm was measured. Data are expressed as mean ± SD of at least three experiments with samples in triplicate. **P < 0.01.\n"," surface. However, in the competitive adhesion inhibition assay, only partial inhibition of GAPDH was observed. Since several other proteins, such as P37 and Vlp have also been verified to contribute to the adhesion process of M. hyorhinis, it can be speculated that when GAPDH is blocked, the adhesion of M. hyorhinis still partly exists.\n"," Mycoplasma hyorhinis is considered to be commensal, colonizing the tonsils and respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity and conducting airways. The occurrence of disease is often related to the systemic invasion of M. hyorhinis. In addition to tonsil, nasal cavity and lung, M. hyorhinis could also be detected or recovered from a variety of other tissues from the infected pigs with clinical symptoms, including heart, pericardium, peritoneum, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, affected joints, spleen, liver, inguinal node, and even from central nervous system [23, [35] [36] [37] [38] . The detection of bacterium in samples collected from affected joints and/or serous membranes is generally required for accurate diagnosis [1] . However, the mechanism of its dissemination is unknown. The plasminogen/plasmin system of the host plays a significant role in several physiological processes, such as degradation of fibrin clots in fibrinolysis and various ECM and connective tissue components, such as laminin and fibronectin [39, 40] . Many bacteria interact with the plasminogen/plasmin system by secreting PAs or, more commonly, by expressing PlgRs on their surface. Binding of plasminogen to bacterial PlgR enhances plasminogen activation by host PAs, and the bacteria consequently turn themselves into proteolytic organisms using the host-derived system [24, 25] . The ability to degrade tissue barriers formed by the ECM, leading to tissue and structure damage, is one of the most important factors in bacterial invasiveness of the host body. Bacteria usually employ multifunctional, highly conserved proteins to capture plasminogen. Members of the glycolytic pathway, chaperones, and other metabolic enzymes have been identified as plasminogen-binding proteins from diverse bacteria [41] . Enolase, a key glycolytic enzyme, is one of the most well-known PlgRs [42, 43] . In addition, GAPDH is another widely studied PlgR. Its plasminogen binding function has been reported in many bacteria, such as streptococci [44, 45] , Escherichia coli [46] , Clostridium perfringens [47] , and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae [30] as well as certain parasites, such as Babesia microti [48] and Dirofilaria immitis [49] , and even mammalian cells [50] . Among Mycoplasma species, the GAPDH of M. pneumoniae is the most studied. Different reports have confirmed that M. pneumoniae GAPDH can bind to plasminogen [12, 16, 20, 32] . However, the activity of the converted plasmin, especially its ability to degrade the ECM, was not significant or consistent in most of the published studies [16, 20] . In the present study, we demonstrated that rGAPDH of M. hyorhinis could bind plasminogen, and the bound plasminogen could be activated by tPA to form the active serine protease plasmin and degrade specific substrates. The binding and activity were markedly inhibited by adding εACA enriched in lysine, indicating the critical role of lysine residues in the interaction between GAPDH and plasminogen. The activity of produced plasmin was further demonstrated using Matrigel degradation analysis. These results indicated the role of the surface located GAPDH as a PlgR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of reconstituted ECM degradation by plasmin in the presence of GAPDH of mycoplasma. Systemic infection is critical for M. hyorhinis to cause disease; therefore, the adhesion molecules that also participate in the plasminogen/plasmin system activation should have more potential as subunit vaccine antigens.\n"," According to current reports, M. hyorhinis has been detected in a variety of tumor tissues, such as gastric cancer and prostate cancer [5, 6] . It is likely that it would disseminate in the human body to form a systemic infection, as it does in pigs [1, 23, 35-38,] , and the exploitation of the plasminogen/plasmin system might also participate in its infection in humans. On the other hand, dysregulation of the plasminogen/ plasmin system is also involved in tumor growth and metastasis formation [51, 52] . Indeed, overexpression of PlgRs, including actin, enolase-1, cytokeratin 8, and annexin II-S100A10, has been associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy in patients with cancer [53] . A number of experiments have shown that M. hyorhinis infection can induce a variety of tumor cells to increase their migration and invasiveness in vitro [54] [55] [56] . Some explanations have been proposed, including the key function of P37 [57, 58] ; however, the precise mechanism by which P37 functions remains unknown. A preliminary test has been carried out, which showed that the amount of plasminogen bound to the surface of M. hyorhinis-infected NCI-H292 cells was higher than that of the uninfected cells [data not shown]. This suggested that M. hyorhinis might act as a bridge to enhance the ability of tumor cells to capture plasminogen to their surface, thereby affecting the subsequent tumor development process.\n"," In addition to binding plasminogen, GAPDH has a variety of other binding activities. The GAPDHs of Clostridium perfringens [47] and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae [30] can also bind to fibronectin. The interaction between M. pneumoniae GAPDH and different ECM components [16, 32] , as well as the interaction between Mycoplasma genitalium GAPDH and mucin [59] , have also been reported. Here, we demonstrated the interaction between rGAPDH of M. hyorhinis and fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV, and vitronectin. Speculatively, in the process of infection, M. hyorhinis first uses adhesion factors such as GAPDH to bind the ECM, facilitating adhesion and colonization. It then recruits plasminogen, and uses activated plasmin to degrade the ECM to help it spread through tissue barriers. The characteristic of one receptor binding to multiple host molecules could help to efficiently direct the plasmin activity to locations where proteolytic activity is required.\n"," GAPDH is a conserved house-keeping enzyme. Among the Mycoplasma species that infect swine, the amino acid sequence identity of the GAPDH protein of M. hyorhinis, M. hyopneumoniae, and Mycoplasma flocculare is above 73%, and the identity between M. hyorhinis and Mycoplasma hyosynoviae is 58.51%. The surface exposure of the GAPDH protein of M. hyopneumoniae, as well as its ability to bind actin, fibronectin, heparin and plasminogen, have been reported [18] . Recently, we demonstrated the hydrolytic activity of its bound plasminogen after activation (non-published results). We speculated that these functions of GAPDH might be universal in swine mycoplasmas.\n"," Present study demonstrated that GAPDH acts as a surface adhesin in M. hyorhinis adhesion to porcine PK-15 cell and human NCI-H292 cell. It also acts as a receptor in the interaction between M. hyorhinis and plasminogen. The activation of the rGAPDH-bound plasminogen has been demonstrated, which resulted in ECM degradation. The binding of rGAPDH to different ECM components has also been proved, and it could help to direct the plasmin activity to locations required.

Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, alone or in combination with each other, are the leading methods for cancer treatment so far. In recent years, the use of cancer vaccines is becoming more and more applicable therapy method due to being a highly successful treatment modality. Many diverse vaccine platforms have been evaluated in clinical trials, among which virus-like particles (VLPs) show great potential in cancer vaccine development. VLPs are multimeric nanostructures with a morphology resembling that of native viruses, but devoid of viral genetic material rendering them non-infectious. Research on the protein-based vaccines against cancer has been carried out for many years. However, it is broadly criticized since protein vaccines generally induce relatively stronger levels of humoral than cellular immunity, while the latter is considered essential for tumour immunotherapy. However, because of their small size (20-100 nm), VLPs can travel in the vessels and can be processed to present the specific epitopes of the carried antigen by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in order to elicit potent specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [1] . VLPs are shown to have the ability to initiate the activation of the immune system and are considered strong activators of dendritic cells (DCs) [2] . VLPs represent pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) primarily localized on immune cells (e.g., DCs, macrophages) [3, 4] . Additionally, VLPs were shown to overcome the immunosuppressive state of the tumor microenvironment to elicit a strong immune response leading to the destruction of cancer cells [5] .\n"," In tumour therapies particular interest is given to the fact that it is possible to induce an immune response in a patient which is directed against his own tumour tissues [6, 7] . From this point of view it is extremely important to be able to identify cancer antigens that are different from the antigens present on healthy cells. Among such antigens, aberrantly glycosylated form of the membranebound mucin 1 (MUC1) expressed in multiple types of cancers is considered an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. Mucins are important glycoproteins which have a protective function for mucosal surfaces [8] [9] [10] [11] expressed mainly in most glandular epithelial cells (e.g., breast lung, pancreas, kidney etc.) [12] . It has been shown that cancer cells contain hypoglycosylated form of MUC1 which is distinct from the normal mucin 1 [13] . The structure and function of the MUC1 glycoprotein encoded by MUC1 gene has been extensively studied confirming the presence of its extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, containing tandemly repeating sequence of 20 amino acids in its extracellular domain [14] . MUC1 is expressed on most epithelial cells and in a healthy tissue negatively charged sugar residues of MUC1 protein create physical barrier to prevent pathogens from colonization [15, 16] . One of the most promising features of MUC1 is its cancer-associated antigenic function due to the presence of tumour-specific antigen epitopes and increased expression in variety of tumour cells [17] . The tumour-associated form of MUC1 is hypoglycosylated [12] in contrast with its heavily glycosylated normal form in healthy, non-cancerous environment which has five potential O-glycosylation sites (because of its PDTRP motif) [18, 19] . Due to such altered glycosylation, new epitopes appear on the cell surface that are absent in normal tissues. As a consequence, tumour-associated MUC1 exposes aberrant tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) in combination with the normal antigens [20] . Because of overexpression and hypoglycosylation in cancer environment MUC1 has lost its polarity. Interestingly, the immune system is not able to recognize the tumour-associated hypoglycosylated MUC1 probably because of self-tolerance mechanisms. It has been shown that synthetic MUC1 glycopeptides do not induce an IgG immune response in humans and mouse models if not conjugated with a T-cell stimulating antigen [21] . So far different types of vaccines have been studied, e.g., cell-, DNA-, RNA-and peptide-based vaccines to deliver the MUC1 antigen [22, 23] , but the future of next generation cancer vaccines is mostly based on bioengineered nanostructures, such as VLPs. Chimeric VLPs presenting the anti-tumour antigens were described for antigens such as: MUC1, survivin [24] , HER-2 [25] , carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) [26] , Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and more [27] [28] [29] . All the developed bioengineered nanoforms were produced in bacterial or insect cells. However, the glycosylation profile of the recombinant proteins and VLPs is very important. Due to the high glycosylation profile of MUC1 and aberrant glycosylation profile of tumour-associated MUC1 it is crucial to choose an expression system supporting the mammalian type of post-translational modification.\n"," Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we present the bioengineered nanostructures based on the Norovirus (NoV) VLPs that present multiple copies of tumourassociated form of MUC1 epitope on their surface. To ensure that the original MUC1 glycosylation profile will be retained, nanostructures were produced in the LEXSY system in Leishmania tarentolae (L. tarentolae) cells. LEXSY system possesses post-translational machinery equipped with enzymes that carry out the glycosylation pattern of mammalian proteins [30] .\n"," Additionally, to further improve the immune response the vaccine preparation was formulated in combination with TLR-independent adjuvant-squalene oil-in-water emulsion MF59 (AddaVax), which is approved to be a safe and effective vaccine adjuvant [31] [32] [33] [34] .\n"," NoV major capsid protein VP1 has an ability to selfassemble into VLPs. By methods of genetic bioengineering a sequence of VP1 gene can be modified by inserting foreign epitopes (antigens) [35] , thus multiple copies of those epitopes are presented on its surface. In this report we introduce tumour-associated MUC1 epitope (PDTR-PAPGSTAPPAHGVTSA) sequence into NoV VP1 gene to produce MUC1 chimeric VLPs (Fig. 1A, B) . The synthetic DNA coding MUC1 epitope was inserted into the second loop of P2 domain of NoV VP1 gene (Fig. 1A) . The expression of the MUC1 chimeric VP1 protein was performed in L. tarentolae cells using a tetracycline inducible LEXSY expression system. Protein expression was analysed by western blotting in reducing conditions. As a negative control unmodified NoV VP1 VLPs described before were used [36] . Obtained results confirmed the presence of MUC1 epitope on chimeric VP1-MUC1 protein but not on empty VP1 platform (Fig. 1C) . Additionally using anti-NoV antibodies we confirmed the higher molecular weight of chimeric VP1-MUC1 (approximately 70 kDa) in comparison to VP1 platform alone (approximately 60 kDa) (Fig. 1C) .\n"," The expression of the chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1 VLPs was performed in high-density L. tarentolae cell cultures (> 10 8 cells/ml) using a tetracycline inducible LEXSY expression system. 72 h after induction cells were harvested and lysed. L. tarentolae cells expressing chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1 were analysed via ELISA assay using anti-MUC1 antibodies to confirm the ability to present MUC1 epitope. For full analysis chimeric VP1-MUC1 lysates were compared with synthetic MUC1 peptide (positive control), NoV VP1 L. tarentolae cell lysates (empty platform) and WT L. tarentolae cell lysates (background). MUC1 epitope was specifically detected only in chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1 cell lysates ( Fig. 2A) .\n"," To determine if the chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1 proteins were in the monomeric, dimeric or multimeric VLP form, we analysed the proteins by OptiPrep (iodixanol) gradient which reported to preserve protein-protein interactions better than concentrated high-osmotic-strength sucrose solutions. Iodixanol gradients have been used with excellent results to purify viral particles whose integrity is sensitive to other separation systems. The lysate containing the chimeric VP1-MUC1 protein from the L. tarentolae was analysed in 30-40% gradient followed by fractionation. Each fraction was then analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting using anti-MUC1 antibody. Obtained results show clear bands of 70 kDa proteins in fractions 6-8 which correspond to 33% gradient band and is in accordance with passing of particles of approximately 40 nm which is the predicted size of chimeric VP1-MUC1 VLPs. While additional protein bands were detected in other fractions, they did not have the required molecular weight and were most likely partially degraded proteins (Fig. 2B ). Purified chimeric VP1-MUC1 VLPs were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The obtained NoV VP1-MUC1 VLPs were about 40 nm, which corresponds to the size of the native NoV platform (Fig. 2C) .\n"," To further analyse the chimeric MUC1 VLPs ELISA assay on plates coated with serial dilutions of L. tarentolae cell lysates was performed. Immuno assay clearly indicated that the NoV VP1-MUC1 protein expressed in L. tarentolae was specifically recognized by anti-MUC1 antibodies (MUC1 was specifically recognized up to 10 3 lysate dilutions) as well as by anti-NoV antibodies confirming the expression of chimeric platform VP1-MUC1. NoV VP1 L. tarentolae cell lysates served as an empty platform control and WT L. tarentolae cell lysates as a background control (Fig. 3) . \n"," To demonstrate the immunogenicity of chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1 VLPs produced in L. tarentolae, three groups of BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously on days: 0, 14, and 28 with chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1 VLPs, NoV VP1 VLPs (empty platform) or PBS. All mice were immunized in presence of a squalene-based oilin-water nanoemulsion adjuvant MF59 (Addavax). Two weeks after the last vaccination, the blood was collected and obtained sera were pooled in each group for further analysis. The humoral response induced by immunization was quantified by ELISA assay on a plate coated with serial dilutions of VLPs (chimeric VP1-MUC, VP1 Analysis of the chimeric VLP-MUC1 presenting platform by ELISA assay with anti-MUC1 and anti-NoV antibodies. ELISA plate was coated with serial dilutions of L. tarentolae NoV VP1-MUC1, NoV VP1 or WT cell lysates. NoV VP1 L. tarentolae cell lysates served as an empty platform control and WT L. tarentolae cell lysates as a background control. The dilution factor is depicted on x-axis. For each ELISA assay, the mean from three independent experiments performed is shown. The mean A450 values and standard deviations are shown on the y-axis empty platform and WT lysates). Sera from mice immunized with 1:1 mix of PBS and MF59 adjuvant served as a negative control. The results confirm the ability of VP1-MUC1 sera to recognize both VP1-MUC1 VLPs as well as an empty platform VP1 with high specificityup to 10 5 dilution (WT L. tarentolae cell lysates served as a background threshold) ( Fig. 4A -C). To fully analyse the strength of MUC1 epitope recognition by obtained MUC1 mouse sera the response to native mucins from pig gastric mucous (Porcine gastric mucin, PGM, Sigma Aldrich) and MUC1 epitope in chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1 expressing L. tarentolae cell lysates was compared to tumour-associated MUC1 peptide serving as a positive control (Fig. 4D) .\n"," The end-point serum titrations show that the chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1 antibody titer reached 10 6 (Fig. 5 ). The antibody titer was estimated as the serum concentration at which the binding was at least 2 times higher than the background.\n"," To identify the type of Ig antibodies produced after vaccination, mouse sera were analysed using Ig Isotyping ELISA test (Invitrogen). The analysis showed high levels of IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgM as well as the presence of both kappa and lambda light chains. Obtained results show strong humoral and cellular response of vaccinated mice to chimeric VLPs presenting tumourassociated MUC1 antigen and the VP1 platform itself. High level of IgG2a suggests the presence of B memory cells. The control group of mice vaccinated with PBS and MF59 adjuvant showed substantial levels of IgG1, IgG2b and IgM confirming immunostimulatory properties of MF59 (Fig. 6) . The IgG antibody subclass distribution elicited after vaccination can be used as an indication of the type of immune response, as cytokines produced by Th1 cells promote a cell-mediated immune response, while cytokines produced by Th2 cells trigger the humoral immune response. In mice, the IgG1 subclass is believed to signal a Th2 response, while IgG2a antibodies are associated with Th1-type responses. As shown in Fig. 6 apart from high levels of IgG1 antibodies, the level of obtained IgG2a antibodies was also significant which leads us to believe that vaccination with chimeric MUC1-VLPs was successful in eliciting the humoral response [37, 38] .\n"," Despite many advances in the field of medicine, cancer is still one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Among many therapies available, cancer immunotherapies which include cell therapies, antibodies, cytokines, oncolytic viruses, and cancer vaccines are one of the most promising. Standard cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation, affect patients body system-wide and cause excessive damage to normal tissue. In contrast, immune responses elicited by vaccines specifically target and destroy cancer cells while preserving healthy tissues. Cancer immunotherapies target all stages of neoplastic process (solid tumours, circulating cancer cells, early stages of cancer progression). Importantly, vaccines generate tumour-specific immune memory that provides long-term protection preventing cancer recurrence. Currently, prophylactic cancer vaccines available on the market target oncoviruses such as human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus. They have successfully prevented cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma [39] . This report 6 Ig isotyping of the pooled mouse sera collected after immunization. Sera from chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1, NoV VP1 or PBS vaccinated mice were analysed on ELISA plates coated with isotype-specific capture antibodies. Tested Ig isotypes are shown on the x-axis. For each ELISA, the mean value from three independent experiments performed is presented. The mean A450 values and standard deviations are shown on the y-axis is the first to describe the possibility of attaining efficient expression of genetically engineered chimeric NoV-based VLPs presenting TAA in the L. tarentolae protozoan. Proposed chimeric VLPs can serve as a possible cancer vaccine candidate and a platform for delivery of tumour associated antigens.\n"," For this study, MUC1 tumour-associated antigen was chosen to be presented on the surface of the chimeric VLPs, as it is considered to be one of the promising targets for cancer vaccines [40] . MUC1 has been shown to be expressed up to tenfold higher on the surface of different human carcinomas than in healthy tissues. Additionally, MUC1-associated antibody production and cellular immune responses have been shown to exert a positive effect on cancer patient outcomes. One of the main features making MUC1 an attractive target for immunotherapies is that in cancer cells, MUC1 is hypoglycosylated, exposing the core epitopes of the extracellular domain that is normally masked by glycans. This exposed VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) region consists multiple copies of 20 amino acids (PDTR-PAPGSTAPPAHGVTSA). Each tandem repeat contains five potential O-glycosylation sites that act as a potential target for antibody-mediated therapy. The aberrant glycosylation in this region was shown to be recognized as antigenically distinct by B cells leading to the production of antibodies specifically recognizing tumour-associated altered glycosylation pattern [41] . Therefore, antibodies against tumour-associated MUC1 are binding to the antigen on the surface of cancer cells, and not to normally glycosylated form of MUC1 on the surface of normal cells. Glycans displayed by tumour cells differ from their normal counterparts both in their expression levels and structure. The main alterations of the tumour-associated glycans include increased branching of N-glycans, truncated O-glycan expression, increased levels of sialylation resulting in an increase in sialyl Lewis x (SLe x ) and Lewisa (SLe a ) antigens, as well as complex core fucosylation [42, 43] . Due to the complex structures of glycans (even when the protein is aberrantly glycosylated) it still requires proper post-translational cellular machinery to preserve the correct pattern of the displayed glycans. To preserve glycosylation pattern specific for the hypoglycosylated MUC1, chimeric MUC1-VLPs were produced in eukaryotic expression system in protozoan parasite L. tarentolae. The major advantage of the LEXSY expression system is its mammalian-type post-translation machinery, which is crucial to preserve specific glycosylation profile of the TAA presented on the nanoparticle. Moreover, LEXSY system allows for easy and cost-efficient scaling up of the cell culture as well as the use of biofermenters. These two features make L. tarentolae-based expression system attractive for industrial-scale tumour associated antigen production [44] . So far, this expression system was used for production of only a small number of viral antigens, e.g., hemagglutinin [45] , human papillomavirus L1 [46] , small surface antigen of hepatitis B virus [47] or NoV VLPs [36] .\n"," Chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1 protein expressed in L. tarentolae cells had higher molecular weight and migrated slower in the reducing SDS-PAGE gel than the NoV VP1 protein (empty platform) which was shown by western blotting analysis. Also, the chimeric VP1-MUC1 protein was specifically recognized by anti-MUC1 antibodies, which was confirmed by ELISA assay. Those results confirm the presence of hypoglycosylated epitope incorporated into NoV VP1 protein. A biophysical analysis of the chimeric NoV MUC1-VLPs performed as an ultracentrifugation in OptiPrep gradient showed that chimeric MUC1 particles were mostly localized in the 33% layer. Moreover, the chimeric VP1-MUC1 protein was properly folded and spontaneously formed VLPs which was confirmed by TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) of collected gradient fractions. NoV MUC1-VLPs were spherical in shape and approximately 40 nm in diameter which is consistent with the previously published data about NoV VLPs expression in yeast [48] , insect [49] and protozoan cells [36] . A dynamic light scattering analysis (DLS) did not reveal any alterations in the quaternary structure of chimeric MUC1-VLPs in comparison to NoV VLPs -empty platform (data not shown). With advances in recombinant technologies allowing VLPs to serve as a delivery tool or platform for foreign antigens, many VLP-based cancer vaccines are entering to the stage of clinical development. VLP-based vaccine candidates show to be efficient in stimulation of the immune system against both pathogens and tumour-associated antigens. VLP-based vaccines have the potential to be used as prophylactic or therapeutic cancer vaccines [50] as they can induce both humoral and cellular responses as well as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which allows effector cells to recognize and kill antibody-coated cells expressing tumour-or pathogenderived antigens on their surface.\n"," Here, we provide strong evidence of the immunogenic potential of chimeric MUC1-VLPs formed by modified full-length NoV VP1 protein produced in L. tarentolae. For mice immunization a formulation of purified chimeric MUC1-VLPs with TLR-independent adjuvantsqualene oil-in-water emulsion MF59 (AddaVax) was used to further boost the immune response to the potential cancer vaccine [51] . Oil-in-water emulsions have been previously shown to increase the efficacy, immunogenicity, and cross-protection of human vaccines as well as enhanced antigen uptake [52] [53] [54] .\n"," Sera of the mice immunized with chimeric NoV VP1-MUC1 VLPs were able to recognize the protozoan parasite-derived antigens of both chimeric MUC1-VLPs and the empty platform (NoV VP1) while having low reactivity with native mucins. Despite many researchers focus on chimeric VLPs as a delivery platform for foreign antigens, there is no other study showing TAA epitopes presented on the surface of the modified nanoparticles. Additionally, here we present a significantly higher level of obtained anti-MUC1 antibodies which coincides to the results obtained by other research groups [55] [56] [57] . Our results demonstrate that immunization with the formulation of chimeric MUC1-VLPs and squalene oil-inwater emulsion MF59 is able to induce a strong immune response and leads to the efficient production of IgG and IgM antibodies. The end-point titration of anti-MUC1 sera showed that antibody titer reached 10^6 and the response to MUC1 antigen was highly specific. The use of VLPs which are naturally occurring conserved PAMPs can stimulate the immune system responses against the delivered antigen. Using this strategy it will be possible to improve the immune response to low immunogenic epitopes such as TAAs [58] , thus giving new possibilities for the development of next-generation cancer vaccines.\n"," Presented results show successful expression of the chimeric MUC1 particles in L. tarentolae that leads to the production of high titers of tumour-associated MUC1 antibodies. Our findings could be of great importance in the search for an alternative solution serving large-scale nanoparticles and tumour-associated recombinant protein production for pharmaceutical purposes.\n"," DNA coding sequence of MUC1 epitope (PDTRPAPG-STAPPAHGVTSA) was synthesized by Gene Art Gene Synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The nanostructure, presenting multiple copies of MUC1 epitope, was based on VP1 capsid protein of human NoV. The GII.4 NoV 2012 pandemic variant (Hu/GII.4/Sydney /NSW0514/2012/AU) Vp1 DNA coding sequence (1637 bp) was modified by addition of cloning sites for XbaI and MspCI restriction enzymes in second loop of P2 domain of VP1 protein, between 371 and 374 amino acids. The sequence was optimized using L. tarentolae-adapted codon and synthesized by Gene Art Gene Synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The synthetized gene was ligated into BglII-NotI restriction sites in the pLEXSY_I-blecherry vector (Jena Bioscience) resulting in platform vector: pLEXSY_I-blecherry3_VP1. The synthetic epitope was cloned as a XbaI/MspCI fragment into platform vector pLEXSY_I-blecherry3_VP1. Resulting plasmid pLEXSY_I-blecherry3_VP1_MUC1 was used for protein expression in LEXSY expression system. As a control VP1 gen was cloned into BglII-NotI restriction sites in the pLEXSY_I-blecherry vector resulting in vector: pLEXSY_I-blecherry3_cVP1.\n"," The inducible LEXSY expression system (Jena Bioscience) was used for NoV VP1-MUC1 protein expression according to the manufacturer's instructions Briefly, the pLEXSY_I-blecherry3_VP1_MUC1 plasmid was delivered into L. tarentolae cells by electroporation. The electroporated cells were grown in a suspension culture in BHI medium supplemented with bleomycin (100 µg/ml). Subsequently, the recombinant cell line was cultivated in 25 cm 2 tissue culture flasks filled with the selective medium containing bleomycin at 26 °C and kept in the dark. The T7 promoter-driven transcription was induced by adding tetracycline at the final concentration of 15 µg/ ml.\n"," NoV VP1-MUC1, NoV VP1 and WT L. tarentolae cell lysates were loaded on 10-20% precast WedgeWell Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and run at the constant voltage of 165 V. After electrophoresis, semi-dry electrotransfer of proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was performed. Membranes were then blocked for 1 h in a 5% semi-skimmed milk solution (5%milk/TBS/0,01%Tween20) and incubated overnight with primary antibodies solution: Armenian hamster anti-MUC1 antibody (MA5-11,202, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:100 in 5%milk/TBS/0,01%Tween20) or rabbit anti-N terminal capsid protein of NoV antibodies (ab92976, Abcam; 1:1000 in 5%milk/ TBS/0,01%Tween20).

A reaction was developed with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n"," Tetracycline-induced L. tarentolae cell culture was grown in shake flasks for 72 h, at 26 °C, in agitated culture to the final optical density of 4-5 at OD600. Cells were then centrifuged for 15 min, 8000 rpm, at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS/0,6%Tween-20) and sonicated (for 40 min, 40% amplitude, 10 s time on, 15 s time off ).

One of the natural reservoirs of EHEC strains is the intestinal tract of ruminants, especially cattle, where they can survive in the presence of mucus-derived carbohydrates (Aperce et al., 2014; Bertin et al., 2013; Fox et al., 2009 ). EHEC O157:H7 strains have caused numerous cases and outbreaks during the last decades (Page and Liles, 2013) Most strains of this serotype express Shiga toxin (Stx) 1 and/or Stx2 with their different variants and the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), encoding a type III secretion system (Scheutz et al., 2011; Stevens and Frankel, 2014) . The first reported EHEC O157:H7 outbreak occurred in 1982 where at least 47 people developed diarrhea in Michigan and Oregon after consuming contaminated meat in a fast-food restaurant (Riley et al., 1983) . One of the strains that have been isolated during this outbreak was EDL933 (O'Brien et al., 1993) . Up to now, this is one of the bestcharacterized EHEC O157:H7 strains worldwide and was therefore used in the current study. The primary site of infection in the human body is the large intestine, where EHEC cells adhere to the intestinal epithelium, damage this cellular barrier by the action of type III effector proteins and translocate Stx into the blood system (Nguyen and Sperandio, 2012) . Infecting EHEC strains may evade host defence, gain access to growth substrates and overcome colonization resistance mechanisms (Stecher and Hardt, 2011) . They replicate in the colon during the course of infection, but up to now, the mechanisms of competition with the microbiota and carbon nutrition are only poorly understood. An important carbon source for EHEC are breakdown products of the gastrointestinal mucus that are produced by the host in high amounts each day . Many commensal gut microorganisms attain required C-and N-sources from mucin glycoproteins (Johansson et al., 2009 (Johansson et al., , 2011 Marcobal et al., 2013) . Endowed with various glycoside hydrolases and exploiting synergistic mechanisms between them they are well adapted to grow in the mucus environment (Marcobal et al., 2013) .\n"," A number of EHEC O157:H7 virulence factors seems to play primary roles in penetration of mucus or adhesion to the mucus-coated colonic epithelium such as the mucinase StcE (Hews et al., 2017) or the H7 flagella (Erdem et al., 2007) . To get access to the limited nutrients in large intestine, replication of EHEC strains depends on mechanisms to compete at least for one of the mucus-derived carbohydrates or to be otherwise metabolically flexible (Conway and Cohen, 2015) . Commensal non-pathogenic E. coli represent presumably the major competitors in the gut, because they exhibit a similar genetic background as EHEC do. Thus, the expression of additional genes involved in sugar catabolism, which are located on genetic mobile elements in EHEC, is imperative for the assertiveness of EHEC towards commensal E. coli. Mucus-derived sugars as fucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, Nacetylgalactosamine or N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) can be utilized by EHEC as well as by commensal E. coli (Aperce et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2004; Fabich et al., 2008) .\n"," Neu5Ac is an α-keto sugar with a nine-carbon backbone, typically found terminally linked to glycan chains of mammalian mucins. Neu5Ac is highly abundant in glycans of the large intestine (Robbe et al., 2003) , where E. coli preferentially colonizes, compared to the small intestine ( Barnett Foster, 2013; Torres et al., 2005) . N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is the hydroxylated derivative of Neu5Ac carrying an OH-group in the N-acetyl chain at carbon C5. Neu5Gc is generated by the enzyme CMP-Neu5Ac-hydroxylase, which is expressed as functional enzyme in all mammals except humans, who produce an inactive enzyme due a deletion in the corresponding chromosome (Peri et al., 2018) . Although humans lack a functioning CMP-Neu5Ac-hydroxylase, Neu5Gc has been found in low quantities in human mucins most likely due to catabolic incorporation from nutritional Neu5Gc derived from red meat (Varki and Schauer, 2009 ). Furthermore, neuraminic acids exhibit a large heterogeneity in the gut with respect to structural modifications of their hydroxyl groups. A very common modification is the O-acetylation with up to four O-acetyl residues at carbon atoms C4, C7, C8 and C9 (Varki and Schauer, 2009; Vimr, 2013) . Neu5Ac is the major sialic acid present in mucin, followed by the mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac-variants Neu5,9Ac 2 , Neu5,7Ac 2 and Neu5,8Ac 2 . Less common are the di-O-acetylated Neu5Ac-species Neu5,8,9Ac 3 and Neu5,7,9Ac 3 (Robbe et al., 2003) .\n"," Nonpathogenic and pathogenic E. coli strains can encode the three chromosomal operons nanATEK-yhcH, nanCMS (formerly yjhATS), and yjhBC, which are involved in sialic acid metabolism. Neu5Ac inactivates the repressor NanR, whereby the nan-operons are activated and sialic acids are catabolized (Rangarajan et al., 2011) . While Neu5Ac is directly taken up by the transporter NanT, O-acetylated sialic acids have to be deacetylated first (Steenbergen et al., 2009) . NanS is an N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid esterase, which deacetylates mono-O-acetylated Neu5,9Ac 2 to Neu5Ac, which is then transported by NanT and utilized as an energy source. It has been shown that NanS is also able to deacetylate mono-O-acetylated Neu5,8Ac 2 , but not the Neu5,7Ac 2 or Neu5,4 Ac 2 isomeric structures (Steenbergen et al., 2009) .\n"," Expressing NanS, commensal non-pathogenic E. coli are able to utilize O-acetylated sialic acids as carbon sources. NanS belongs to the large family of SGNH serine proteases, which are not only found in commensal bacteria, but also in a number of pathogens that produce sialate O-acetylesterases (Corfield et al., 1992 (Corfield et al., , 1993 Phansopa et al., 2015) . Vimr (2013) have extensively reviewed the bacterial sialometabolism and reported that many enteropathogenic E. coli strains harbor further nanS-homologs.\n"," The pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 strain EDL933 encodes several nanS-homologous alleles (nanS-p), which are localized in prophage genomes in the region of late gene expression (Saile et al., 2016) . Recently, the enzymatic characteristics of recombinantly expressed NanS-p1, NanS-p2, and NanS-p4 of strain EDL933 were determined and an Nacetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid esterase activity was detected for the three enzymes. The three variants were investigated as representatives of the EDL933 NanS-p and were selected due to phylogenetic reasons (Saile et al., 2016) . For analysis of the role of NanS-p, several nanS and nanS-p deletion mutants have been constructed up to a supermutant that did not contain any nanS or nanS-p genes, and their role in substrate utilization has been demonstrated (Saile et al., 2016) . Compared to nanS, the nanS-p genes harbour additional nucleotides downstream of the SGNH hydrolase-like domain and a DUF1737 domain. The function of the DUF1737 domain is still unknown (Rangel et al., 2016; Saile et al., 2016) .\n"," In the human large intestine, commensal mucin-degrading species of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia can cleave bound sialic acids from glycans by intrinsic sialidases, providing free nutritional sialic acids for sialidase-negative E. coli (Robinson et al., 2017; Tailford et al., 2015; Vimr et al., 2004) . Sialidases are substrate-specific and the decoration of sialic acids with one or more O-acetyl residues prevents sialidases from enzymatic cleavage. The activity of sialidases increases upon removal of O-acetyl groups from sialic acids by sialate O-acetylesterases (Phansopa et al., 2015) . B. thetaiotaomicron, for example, represents a commensal of the gut, that produces a number of glycoside hydrolases such as the B. thetaiotaomicron sialidase BTSA (Park et al., 2013) , enabling this microorganism to release terminally bound sialic acids from mucin.\n"," The aim of the current study was to further characterize the enzymatic properties of recombinant NanS and NanS-p derivatives to cleave O-acetyl residues from O-acetylated neuraminic acids and BSM, also in combination with recombinant BTSA. Moreover, growth experiments with EHEC wildtype strains and nanS-p mutants were performed to study the influence of the enzymes in vitro.\n"," Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .\n"," E. coli O157:H7 strain EDL933 was grown on LB agar (1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7) at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm.

NanoESI MS analysis of O-acetylesterase-treated BSM revealed enzymatic de-O-acetylation of mucin-bound mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids\n"," In a next step, we wanted to determine the specificity of recombinant NanS and NanS-p O-acetylesterases more precisely, since O-acetyl groups do not only occur at positions C4 or C9, but also at C7 or C8 of sialic acids. Additionally, di-and tri-O-acetylated derivatives exist and unravelling NanS-or NanS-p-mediated de-O-acetylation of such sialic acids was also in the focus of our investigation. Consequently, we used BSM as a source for mucin-bound Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc and their diverse O-acetylated derivates, which are components of highly sialylated O-glycans of BSM as proposed in the manufacturer's data sheet (Merck, Darmstadt) . Moreover, in recent work we could already demonstrate NanS-p activity in BSM (Saile et al., 2016) .\n"," In the initial experiment, BSM-derived sialic acids, obtained by mild acid treatment, were analyzed by nanoESI MS. The obtained mass spectrum demonstrated the presence of Neu5Ac as well as the corresponding mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac derivatives ( Fig. 2A) . In addition, mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Gc variants were detected. All detected sialic acid derivatives, which were chemically released from BSM O-glycans, are listed together with their m/z values Neu5,4 Ac 2 incubated with NanS-p EHEC O-acetylesterases. Three μl of 1 mg/ mL Neu5Ac (Fig. 1A,B, lanes 1,8) , Neu5,9Ac 2 (Fig. 1A, lanes 2,9) and Neu5,4 Ac 2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 2,9) preparations each, were applied onto HPTLC plates as controls. In addition, three μl of 1 mg/ml Neu5,9Ac 2 (Fig. 1A, lane 3) , and Neu5,4 Ac 2 (Fig. 1B, lane 3) containing reaction buffer without enzymes were applied as buffer controls. Neu5,9Ac 2 was digested with NanS-His (Fig.1A , lane 4), NanS-p1-His (Fig.1A, lane 5) , NanS-p2-His (Fig.1A, lane 6) and NanS-p4-His (Fig.1A, lane 7) . Neu5,4 Ac 2 was digested with NanS-His (Fig.1B, lane  4) , NanS-p1-His (Fig. 1B, lane 5) , NanS-p2-His (Fig. 1B, lane 6) , and NanS-p4-His (Fig. 1B, lane 7) . Ions corresponding to Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, Neu5Ac(OAc), Neu5Gc(OAc), Neu5Ac(OAc) 2 and Neu5Gc(OAc) 2 were detected in the spectrum BSM-derived sialic acids after treatment with NanS-His.

The numbered ions in the mass spectra depicted in panel A, B, and C, are listed in Table 2A -C, respectively.\n"," in Table 2A .\n"," In order to clarify, whether NanS-His and NanS-p-His O-acetylesterases are able to deacetylate mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc species detected in BSM, we incubated BSM with either NanS-His, NanS-p1-His, NanS-p2-His or NanS-p4-His. Afterwards, the chemically released sialic acids were identified by nanoESI MS. Mass spectra of sialic acids obtained after exposure of BSM to the recombinant O-acetylesterases are exemplarily shown for NanS-His and NanS-p1-His in Fig. 2B and 2C, respectively. Identified sialic acids with the corresponding ion species and their m/z values are listed in Table 2B and C, respectively. Spectra of BSM-derived sialic acids upon exposure to NanS-His or NanS-p1-His evidenced predominant Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc core structures, accompanied by weaker signals, which could be assigned to mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc(OAc) species and the di-O-acetylated Neu5Ac(OAc) 2 derivative. Importantly, Neu5Ac(OAc) 3 and Neu5Gc(OAc) 3 variants, which appear in the spectra at m/z 458.13 and m/z 474.13, respectively, were undetectable after O-acetylesterase treatment. Similar results were obtained with recombinant NanS-p2-His and NanS-p4-His (data not shown). Our results show that NanS as well as NanS-p are able to release acetyl residues not only from mono-O-acetylated sialic acids, but also from di-and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids as demonstrated for Neu5Ac(OAc) 2 , Neu5Ac(OAc) 3 , and their di-and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Gc counterparts. Furthermore, we could show that NanS and NanS-p have the ability to deacetylate O-acetylated sialic acids in soluble form and linked to O-glycans of mammalian mucin.\n"," To explore the general accessibility of mucin-derived Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc as a substrate for commensal sialidases like BTSA from B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, we exposed BTSA-His and NanS-His or its homologs simultaneously to BSM, suggesting that de-O-acetylated sialic acids are convenient substrates for the sialidase. For this purpose, we incubated BSM with either sialidase BTSA-His, or coincubated BSM with sialidase BTSA-His and either NanS-His, NanS-p1-His, NanS-p2-His or NanS-p4-His. After an exposure time of 4 h, we determined the sialic acids released from BSM first by means of HPTLC. The results of the enzymatic digestions of BSM using BTSA-His alone and combined with NanS-His, NanS-p1-His, NanS-p2-His or NanS-p4-His are shown in Fig. 3 . One mg/mL Neu5Ac (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 9) or Neu5,9Ac 2 (Fig. 3,  lanes 2, 10) were used as standards. Due to its higher polarity, Neu5,9Ac 2 clearly separates beyond Neu5Ac allowing for unequivocal distinction of the two compounds. BSM incubated in buffer only without enzymes served as negative control (Fig. 3, lane 3) .\n"," The HPTLC analysis of enzymatically released sialic acids from BSM after incubation with BTSA-His alone (Fig. 3, lane 4) revealed two clearly DAPA-stained bands indicating the presence of enzymatically cleaved de-O-acetylated and mono-O-acetylated sialic acids. On the other hand, the combination of BTSA-His with NanS-His (Fig. 3, lane 5) , NanS-p1-His (Fig. 3, lane 6) , NanS-p2-His (Fig. 3, lane 7) or NanS-p4-His (Fig. 3, lane 8 ) revealed a single strong band, which separates at the position of Neu5Ac in the chromatogram as deduced from standard Neu5Ac (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 9) .\n"," Collectively, our experimental data gave evidence that BTSA-His is able to cleave Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac 2 from BSM. The enzyme seems not to exhibit any specificity for Neu5Ac or the O-acetylated derivative. Coincubation of BSM with BTSA-His and O-acetylesterases revealed Neu5Ac only, while Neu5,9Ac 2 could not be detected. Due to the suggested capability of NanS-His and its homologs to deacetylate mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids, the above described digests were repeated and the released sialic acids were detected using mass spectrometry. For this purpose, proteins of the digests were precipitated with methanol and the supernatants were directly applied to nanoESI MS. Mass spectra of sialic acids obtained from digests of BSM using BTSA-His alone, BTSA-His combined with NanS-His and BTSA-His combined with NanS-p1-His are shown in Fig. 4A , 4B and 4C, respectively. Identified sialic acids with the m/z values of the corresponding ions are listed in Table 3A -C, respectively. The mass spectrum obtained from BSM exposed to BTSA-His alone (Fig. 4A) shows ions derived from Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc basic structures and Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc (OAc) (listed in Table 3A ). Thus, BTSA-His was capable to cleave off Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc as well as the mono-O-acetylated counterparts from glycans. Di-and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids were not detected and Neu5Ac (lanes 1, 9) , and Neu5,9Ac 2 (lanes 2, 10) served as standards.\n"," hence not released by BTSA-His. The combination of BTSA-His with the O-acetylesterases NanS-His or NanS-p1-His revealed ions indicating liberated Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc as shown in the mass spectra of Fig. 4B (listed in Table 3B ) and Fig. 4C (listed in Table 3C ), respectively. Both combined approaches revealed Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc but no O-acetylated sialic acids. The combination of BTSA-His and NanS-p2-His or NanS-p4-His gave the same results (data not shown).\n"," In conclusion, the results demonstrate that the combination of both BTSA-His with NanS-His or NanS-p1-His, respectively, enhances the release of de-O-acetylated core Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from mammalian mucin O-glycans, which might serve as a carbon and/or nitrogen source for EHEC.\n"," 4. Recombinant BTSA supports the growth of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 on BSM dependent on the presence of NanS-p\n"," We compared the growth behaviour (OD 600 values) of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 (NZ_CP015855) (Saile et al., 2016) , EDL933ΔnanS, and EDL933ΔnanSΔnanS-p1a-p7 for 24 h in growth medium containing BSM with or without BTSA-His. Despite an expected trend of the OD 600 values, which decreased from 0.88, 0.8 to 0.76 for EDL933, EDL933ΔnanS and EDL933ΔnanSΔnanS-p1a-p7, respectively, the differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 7) . However, if BTSA-His was added to the medium, significant differences in the OD 600 between EDL933ΔnanSΔnanS-p1a-p7 and EDL933 or EDL933ΔnanS was detected with values of 0.91, 1.32 or 1.24, respectively (Fig. 5) . For all strains, an increased OD 600 was observed when BTSA-His was added, compared to the cultivation without BTSA-His. An explanation for this phenomenon is that both, Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac 2 , terminally bound to the mucin, were released by BTSA-His, whereby the degradation of Neu5Ac was unaffected by the deletions. Thus, Neu5,9Ac 2 may be additionally utilized by EDL933 or EDL933ΔnanS. As a control a culture of EDL933ΔnanSΔnanS-p1a-p7 was supplemented with NanS-p4-His, resulting in an OD 600 comparable to that of a wildtype EDL933 culture.\n"," The results of this study showed for the first time, that NanS-p Oacetylesterases are active in a mucin environment and can de-O- Fig. 4 . nanoESI mass spectra of sialic acids obtained from digests of BSM treated with BTSA-His alone (A), BTSA-His combined with NanS-His (B), and BTSA-His combined with NanS-p1-His (C).

Ac, Neu5Ac; Ac(OAc), Neu5Ac (OAc); Gc, Neu5Gc; Gc(OAc), Neu5Gc(OAc). The numbered ions in the mass spectra depicted in panel A, B, and C, are listed in Table 3A -C, respectively.\n"," Detected ions assigned to sialic acids obtained by treatment of BSM with BTSA-His alone (A), BTSA-His combined with NanS-His (B), and BTSA-His combined with NanS-p1-His (C) and corresponding m/z values.\n"," Sialic acid species m/z acetylate mucin-derived sialic acids in vitro, in combination with sialidase treatment.\n"," According to current concepts, EHEC have to outcompete the gut microbiota for access to energy sources for a successful infection process. Sialic acids are highly abundant in the large intestine, where they decorate the mucus layer(s) in terminally exposed positions on the mucin O-glycans. Sialic acids can be modified by up to three acetic acid esters at the positions of the hydroxyl groups of the sialic acid core including Neu5Gc species, whereby Neu5Gc and its derivatives do exist in all mammals except humans (Robbe et al., 2003; Varki and Schauer, 2009; Vimr, 2013) . While pure Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc are readily cleavable by bacterial sialidases, O-acetylation protects them from enzymatic hydrolysis (Juge et al., 2016) . The intestinal E. coli strains are generally considered competitors for EHEC strains owing to their similar genetic background. Both groups harbor genes for sialic acid metabolism and are able to utilize free sialic acids as carbon and nitrogen sources. Compared to commensal nonpathogenic E. coli, EHEC harbor several phage-encoded NanS homologs (NanS-p) (Saile et al., 2016 (Saile et al., , 2018 . These enzymes catalyze de-O-acetylation of Neu5,9Ac 2 to Neu5Ac, which after sialidase action can be taken up and metabolized by both, commensal and pathogenic E. coli (Saile et al., 2016 (Saile et al., , 2018 . Currently, it is not known, why EHEC strains contain a chromosomal nanS gene and multiple prophage-associated nanS-p genes. One hypothesis is that multiple nanS-p genes confer a gene dose effect to ensure substrate utilization and to outcompete commensal E. coli in the gut (Saile et al., 2016) .\n"," In this study, we demonstrated that recombinant NanS and NanS-p O-acetylesterases of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 were able to de-Oacetylate sialic acids using BSM as a source for glycan-bound sialic acids. NanoESI MS spectra of chemically released sialic acids from BSM revealed ion signals of mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc derivatives. NanS and NanS-p were capable to de-O-acetylate such O-acetylated sialic acids of BSM as determined by nanoESI MS analysis. Since various of the known microbial 9-O-acetylesterases are unable to de-O-acetylate Neu5,4 Ac 2 , we probed the specificity of NanS and the NanS-p esterases with respect to cleavage of the acetyl ester at C4 of Neu5Ac. HPTLC analysis revealed that neither NanS nor the NanS-p esterases are able to split off the O-acetyl group from this position. Mass spectra of NanS-or NanS-p-treated mucin still exhibited ion signals of O-acetylated sialic acids. Since O-acetyl groups are mostly located at position C4 and/or C9, it is tempting to speculate that the detected mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac-species represent the Neu5,4 Ac 2 isomer. Otherwise, an incomplete digestion or inactivation of the enzymes due to long-lasting incubation at elevated temperature could be the reason.\n"," Furthermore, we could show that NanS and the NanS-p esterases deacetylate not only free sialic acids, but also glycosidically bound sialic acid of BSM. Although EHEC does not encode a sialidase, de-Oacetylation of bound sialic acids leads to liberation of acetate, which in turn can be readily used as an additional carbon source. However, de-Oacetylation results in sialidase-accessible Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc basic structures, which are common substrates of commensal sialidases, e.g., BTSA of B. thetaiotaomicron. In order to verify this hypothesis, we probed the removal of BSM-bound sialic acids with BTSA-His. This sialidase hydrolyzes pure Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc and also the mono-Oacetylated counterparts Neu5Ac(OAc) and Neu5Gc(OAc). Di-and tri-Oacetylated sialic acids were resistant towards BTSA giving evidence for a protective effect of O-acetylated sialic acids from degradation.\n"," Combined exposure of BTSA with NanS or NanS-p resulted in release of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from BSM, which can then be metabolized in soluble form by EHEC. Even though B. thetaiotaomicron encodes sialidases, this bacterium lacks the nan operon and is unable to utilize released sialic acids as a nutrient. Therefore, the complementary action of both enzymes may result in a higher content of free sialic acids in the gut. In order to assess the growth-promoting effect of a mixed enzyme treatment, we cultivated the EHEC O157:H7 wildtype strain EDL933, and its mutant strains EDL933ΔnanS and EDL933ΔnanSΔnanS-p1a-p7 on mucin, mucin supplemented with BTSA-His and mucin exposed to BTSA-His combined with NanS-p-His. The combination revealed a significantly enhanced bacterial growth suggesting that EHEC exploits sialidases of commensal gut bacteria, and is supported by own Oacetylesterases to get access to O-glycan-derived sialic acids of intestinal mucus. On principle, sialic acids per se and particularly the Oacetylated species prevent from subsequent digest of desialylated glycans by glycosidases (Phansopa et al., 2015) . Collectively, the sialidasemediated release of sialic acids combined with complementary saponification of acetic acid side chains allows for ensuing stepwise digest of desialylated glycans by glycosidases such as galactosidases, N-acetylhexosaminidases or fucosidases. It can be speculated that the primary role of NanS-p esterases during infection could be the perturbation of the mucus layer integrity and initiation of commensal degradation, which may enable or at least facilitate EHEC strains crossing of the mucus barrier and getting access to the epithelial cells in the colon.\n"," Interestingly, a number of viruses do exist, e.g., human coronavirus OC43 or mouse hepatitis virus, encoding for O-acetylesterases that may play a comparative role like the bacterial esterases during infection. These enzymes are mostly specific for Neu5,9Ac 2 (human coronavirus OC43) or Neu5,4 Ac 2 (mouse hepatitis virus) (Strasser et al., 2004) . The influenza C virus encodes for an O-acetylesterase being capable to hydrolyze glycosidically bound Neu5,9Ac 2 , Neu5,7(8),9Ac 3 and Neu5Gc9Ac of BSM in a similar manner like NanS-p-His (Strasser et al., 2004) . This O-acetylesterase enables the virus to attach to the host membrane, destroys receptors accompanied with altered signal transduction in the host cell and enables viral entry (Ayora-Talavera, 2018; Matrosovich et al., 2015; Strasser et al., 2004) .\n"," We propose that NanS-p esterases might have an important complementary role during mixed viral and bacterial infections due to their broad specificity compared to that of the influenza C virus esterase. Thus, EHEC NanS-p esterases, which have the potency to de-O-acetylate mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated receptor-bound sialic acids, might have a yet underestimated functional role throughout initial infection and immune evasion of EHEC. Further work is necessary to clarify the role of NanS-p O-acetylesterases with regard to their involvement in maintenance and successful colonization of EHEC strains.\n","Score: 3.5185674579298367\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof ACE2 internalization induced by a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein is modulated by angiotensin II type 1 and bradykinin 2 receptors ACE2 internalization induced by a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein is modulated by angiotensin II type 1 and bradykinin 2 receptors\n","Body Text: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key counterbalancing enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that catalyzes the conversion of the pressor hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) into the protective angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) [1] . Ang II acts through the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and causes vasoconstriction, apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis. In contrast, Ang1-7 acts via the Mas receptor (MasR) and causes vasodilation as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects [2] [3] [4] . The interest on ACE2 research was renewed with the outbreak of the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) since this cell surface enzyme was identified as the main receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entrance into host alveolar type II epithelial cells [5] [6] [7] . Similar to other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 takes advantage of the cellular endocytic machinery to initiate the infection [8] . The spike protein (S protein) anchored to the viral envelope binds to of GPCRs functionality by interaction with other receptors or membrane proteins, such as ACE2.\n"," Here we explored the role of AT1R and B2R as well as the effect of their ligands on the internalization of GFP-tagged ACE2 (ACE2-GFP) induced by a recombinant RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in a heterologous expression system. Moreover, we monitored changes in AT1R and B2R functionality upon ACE2 coexpression by assaying their effect on Ca V 2.2 currents. Our results unmask a role for AT1R and B2R on RBD-induced ACE2 internalization, and provide new insights into the modulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection with an ultimate therapeutic purpose.\n"," We first assessed whether RBD induces internalization of ACE2 in our experimental model. We incubated HEK293T cells transfected with ACE2-GFP with recombinant RBD for 40 minutes and stained the plasma membrane with a live-cell labeling compound previously used by our group [52, 53, 55] . After the incubation, in RBD-treated cultures a fraction of cells showed clustered GFP signal at the plasma membrane or in intracellular compartments, whereas in vehicle-treated cultures cells only displayed GFP signal uniformly distributed at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A ).\n"," Next, we performed an immunostaining against RBD in HEK293T cells expressing ACE2-GFP incubated with RBD for 40 minutes to assess RBD internalization (Fig. 1B) .\n"," Consistent with our previous observations, in vehicle-treated cultures we only found cells with GFP signal uniformly distributed at the plasma membrane, whereas in RBDtreated cultures we mostly found cells with GFP signal clustered in spots in the plasma membrane or inside the cell. As expected, red fluorescent signal indicating RBD immunoreactivity was only observed in transfected cells (ACE2-GFP positive) of RBDtreated cultures. Importantly, RBD-immunoreactive signal was distributed in discrete clusters at the plasma membrane and the intracellular compartment and colocalized with GFP signal, suggesting an RBD-ACE2 joint internalization. These observations indicate that RBD induces ACE2-GFP internalization in our experimental system. follows: GFP uniformly distributed in the plasma membrane (PMU GFP), GFP clustered in the plasma membrane (PMC GFP), and GFP clustered in intracellular compartments with or without clustered GFP in the plasma membrane (Internalized GFP). In vehicletreated cultures, all cells corresponded to the PMU GFP group, whereas in RBDtreated cultures a significant number of cells with PMC GFP or internalized GFP was observed (Fig. 2B) . After 5 and 10 minutes of RBD incubation, the majority of the cells (~65-70%) showed PMC GFP signal, with a small proportion showing internalized GFP at 10 minutes. Notably, the percentage of cells displaying internalized GFP increased (~60%) and the percentage of cells with PMC GFP (~30%) decreased at 40 minutes of incubation. In order to statistically compare this observation, we arranged the different GFP signal patterns into degrees of internalization (PMU GFP-degree 0, PMC GFPdegree 1, and Internalized GFP-degree 2) and tested the association between RBD incubation time and the frequency of cells with different ACE2-GFP internalization degree. We found a strong positive association between these two variables (χ 2 = 190.03, P chi < 0.0001; Somers´ D = 0.57, directional coefficient for the association between RBD incubation time and ACE2-GFP internalization degree). These results suggest that RBD induces ACE2 internalization in a time-dependent manner, and allow us to propose that the different patterns of GFP signal discriminated in our system correspond to different degrees of ACE2-GFP internalization.\n"," In order to test if AT1R affects RBD-induced ACE2 internalization, we transfected HEK293T cells with ACE2-GFP alone or with ACE2-GFP plus AT1R and incubated them with RBD for 40 minutes (Fig. 3A) . We found that the coexpression of AT1R failed to change the distribution of cells with different GFP signal patterns in both vehicle-and RBD-treated conditions in comparison with cultures only expressing ACE2-GFP. To assess the effect of AT1R ligands on RBD-induced ACE2-GFP internalization, we next incubated cells coexpressing ACE2-GFP and AT1R with vehicle or RBD plus vehicle, an AT1R agonist (Ang II) or an AT1R antagonist internalization degree. In particular, we considered AT1R activity levels as 0 in telmisartan-coincubated cells, 1 in vehicle-coincubated cells and 2 in Ang IIcoincubated cells, and the internalization degrees as done above (PMU GFP-degree 0, PMC GFP-degree 1, and Internalized GFP-degree 2). We found a significant positive correlation between AT1R activity levels and the frequency of cells displaying the different ACE2-GFP internalization degrees (χ 2 = 17.89, P chi < 0.01; Somers´ D = 0.24).\n"," These data indicate that RBD induced-ACE2 internalization depends on AT1R activity.\n"," In order to test if B2R affects RBD-induced ACE2 internalization, we incubated HEK293T cells transfected with ACE2-GFP alone or plus B2R with RBD for 40 minutes (Fig. 4) . In RBD-treated cultures, we found that B2R coexpression dramatically reduced \n"," Increasing evidence indicates that AT1R and B2R form heteromers whose properties differ from the individual receptors [36, 43, 61, 62] . To test if AT1R and B2R coexpression affects RBD-induced ACE2-GFP internalization, we incubated HEK293T cells co-transfected with ACE2-GFP and AT1R or ACE2-GFP, AT1R and B2R with increase in the frequency of cells with internalized GFP concomitant with a decrease in the frequency of cells with PMC GFP compared with the other conditions indicating a partial rescue of RBD-induced ACE2-GFP internalization. Taken together, these experiments suggest that Ang II has a pro-internalizing effect that overcomes B2R inhibitory action on RBD-induced ACE2 internalization.\n"," 6. ACE2-GFP coexpression modifies AT1R-, but not B2R-ligand evoked inhibition of Ca V 2.2 currents.\n"," Since AT1R and B2R modulated RBD-induced ACE2-GFP internalization, we then explored if conversely ACE2-GFP affects AT1R and B2R ligand-evoked action on Ca V 2.2, a well-established GPCRs target [46] . First, we tested the effect of ACE2-GFP coexpression on BK-evoked B2R activity in HEK293T cells expressing Ca V 2.2 (plus its auxiliary subunits) and B2R in presence or absence of ACE2-GFP. As shown before [50] , BK-evoked B2R activity inhibited Ca V 2.2 currents. Similar percentages of Ca V 2.2 current inhibition were detected in cells coexpressing ACE2-GFP in presence of BK ( Fig. 6A) . Interestingly, AT1R co-expression reduced BK-induced Ca V 2.2 current inhibition, and such effect was restored to control levels (+ B2R) in cells coexpressing B2R, AT1R and ACE2-GFP. Next, in order to test the effect of ACE2-GFP coexpression on Ang II-evoked AT1R activity we measured calcium currents in HEK293T cells expressing Ca V 2.2 (plus its auxiliary subunits) and AT1R in presence or absence of ACE2-GFP. As previously shown [49, 57] , Ang II-evoked AT1R activity inhibited Ca V 2.2 currents (Fig. 6B) . Notably, the coexpression of AT1R with either ACE2-GFP, B2R or ACE2-GFP plus B2R decreased Ang II-mediated Ca V 2.2 currents inhibition. Thus, ACE2-GFP coexpression impacts on Ang-evoked AT1R action on Ca V 2.2 currents but does not affect BK-evoked B2R effect on these currents.\n"," To study if ACE2-GFP coexpression modifies the ligand-independent activities of B2R and AT1R, we then assessed Ca V 2.2 currents in HEK293T cells expressing B2R, AT1R or both receptors in presence or absence of ACE2-GFP. We found that ACE2-GFP coexpression did not change basal Ca V 2.2 macroscopic currents in AT1Rexpressing cells but significantly reduced them in B2R-expressing cells, in comparison with cells expressing only the respective GPCR ( Fig. 7A and B) . Strikingly, ACE2-GFP coexpression increased the Ca V 2.2 currents in HEK293T cells expressing B2R and AT1R (Fig. 7C) . Thus, ACE2-GFP coexpression has opposite effects on basal Ca V 2.2 currents in B2R and B2R-AT1R expressing cells.\n"," Journal Pre-proof DISCUSSION ACE2 is a transmembrane enzyme important for the regulation of the RAS that has regained interest because it was recently identified as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the study of the factors and mechanisms that regulate ACE2 internalization would provide new insights into the modulation of coronavirus infection. Here, we not only confirmed that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein induces ACE2 internalization, but also demonstrated for the first time that this process is modulated by GPCRs involved in the RAS. Using the AT1R agonist Ang II and the AT1R antagonist telmisartan, we revealed that the activity of AT1R positively correlates with the degree of RBD-induced ACE2 internalization. We also uncover a novel and strong inhibitory effect of B2R on RBD-induced ACE2 internalization that persists in the presence of AT1R and is mildly modified by its endogenous ligand BK. Notably, the inhibitory action of B2R coexpression on ACE2 internalization was reversed by Ang II in the presence of AT1R, which positions this hormone as a pro-internalizing factor. Complementary, we found that ACE2 modifies the capability of AT1R and B2R to inhibit Ca V 2.2 calcium currents likely due to an interaction with these receptors.\n"," Current results indicate that RBD rapidly induces ACE2-GFP internalization in a time-dependent fashion. ACE2 internalization is induced by SARS-CoV-2 and other related viruses such as HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV [7, 9, 63, 64] . RBD is the minimal receptor-binding domain of the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 and its predecessor SARS-CoV, and has been previously used as a model to study viral infections [65] . In cell cultures incubated with RBD, we observed clear signs of ACE2-GFP internalization with cells displaying clustered GFP signal at the cytoplasm or the plasma membrane that colocalized with RBD signal. A similar ACE2 signal pattern denoting internalization has been previously shown by other authors studying SARS-CoV infections. In those reports, nearly all HEK293T cells expressing ACE2-GFP incubated for 3 hours with a recombinant RBD, S protein, or lentiviruses pseudotyped with S protein exhibited punctuated cytoplasmic GFP signal [65, 66] . However, cells with clustered GFP signal at the plasma membrane (PMC GFP) were not reported presumably due to the longer incubation time tested (3 hours) [65, 66] in comparison with ours (40 min), which may allow a complete internalization of ACE2. We hypothesize that the prevalence of cells with PMC GFP at short time points indicates an initial stage in the internalization of the ACE2-RBD complex. Further supporting this notion, a similar distribution of clustered signal at the plasma membrane was shown for other membrane proteins endocyted via clathrin-mediated pathways [67] and upon inhibition of membrane receptors internalization [68] . Notably, the kinetics of ACE2-GFP internalization observed in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof current study is in agreement with recent observations showing SARS-CoV-2 S protein uptake as early as 5 minutes, and higher uptake at 30 minutes of exposure [10] .\n"," Here we reveal a novel inhibitory action of B2R on RBD-induced ACE2-GFP internalization. Previous studies have reported effects of B2R retaining receptors at the cell membrane by heteromerization. In this regard, B2R coexpression was shown to delay Ang1-7-induced sequestration of MasR from the plasma membrane [69] , and to stabilize B1R at the cell surface in the absence of its ligand [70] . Thus, it is likely that B2R prevents RBD-induced ACE2-GFP internalization due to a direct interaction with ACE2. Further supporting this possibility, we found that ACE2 coexpression alters basal calcium currents in cells expressing B2R alone or plus AT1R. Besides, the formation of complexes between ACE2 and other receptors of the RAS (AT1R, AT2R, MasR) has been extensively demonstrated [21, 22, 69] . Interestingly, we also observed that neither AT1R coexpression, a GPCR known to heteromerize with B2R [43, 61, 62] , nor BK application were able to unlock the B2R inhibition of ACE2 internalization suggesting that the functional crosstalk between B2R and ACE2 is strong. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, our findings indicate that B2R is a protective factor that acts interrupting or delaying viral entry. Further protective effects of B2R might emerge from the retention of ACE2 on the plasma membrane that could avoid Ang II accumulation and promote the Ang 1-7/MasR axis counteracting Ang II detrimental effects in the infection and inflammation [16] .\n"," We found that RBD-induced ACE2-GFP internalization is modulated by AT1R.\n"," Previous studies have shown that Ang II triggers AT1R and ACE2 co-internalization [22] , and ACE2 coexpression downregulates Ang II induced-AT1R signaling [21] as a consequence of an interaction between ACE2 and AT1R. Further supporting this, in our electrophysiological experiments ACE2 coexpression dramatically impaired Ang IIinduced AT1R inhibitory action on Ca V 2.2 calcium currents. Thus, it is likely that Ang II enhances ACE2 internalization trough the AT1R-ACE2 complex increasing the percentage of cells with internalized ACE2-GFP. Conversely, telmisartan binding to AT1R would modify the conformation of the ACE2-AT1R complex and prevent the interaction of RBD with ACE2 leading to a reduction in the percentage of cells with internalized ACE2-GFP. Interestingly, Ang II not only increased ACE2-GPF internalization in presence of AT1R, but also in cells coexpressing AT1R and B2R, unlocking the strong B2R inhibition of RBD-induced ACE2 internalization. This observation indicates a stronger influence of AT1R on ACE2 than B2R. In summary, our findings show that Ang II is a potent pro-internalizing factor that might promote SARS-CoV-2 entry, while telmisartan has opposite effects and might act as an infection Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a hallmark of severe cases of and is the result of a systemic inflammatory response known as the cytokine storm [71] . It has been suggested that accumulation of Ang II due to the reduction in plasma membrane ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to such pro-inflammatory state [1, 13, 18] . AT1R blockers have been proposed to avoid the detrimental effects of Ang II accumulation [19, 20] . In this regard, in a recent clinical trial in COVID-19 patients telmisartan showed potent anti-inflammatory actions as well as a reduction in the morbidity and mortality of the disease [72] . The modulation of RBD-induced ACE2 internalization by AT1R ligands described here demonstrates an effect of these compounds in the infection per se, besides the previously shown in the inflammatory state of patients suffering from COVID-19. This suggests a dual role of AT1R ligands in the disease: Ang II might act as a pro-inflammatory and pro-internalizing factor, whereas telmisartan might act as an anti-inflammatory and an infection-delaying agent.\n"," The pro-internalizing action of Ang II found here extends the knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of hypertension as a risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 [28] [29] [30] 73] . On the other hand, the anti-internalizing action of telmisartan supports the use of AT1R blockers to avoid or counteract Ang II detrimental effects and could explain in part the reduced severity and mortality of the disease in hypertensive patients chronically treated with AT1R [74] [75] [76] .\n"," In summary, our study demonstrates that AT1R and B2R modulate the internalization of ACE2 induced by a SARS-CoV-2 surface protein, and inversely, ACE2 modifies AT1R and B2R functionality. Altogether, the current findings contribute to understand the role of RAS components in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the severity of COVID-19, and pave the way through the development of drugs aimed to limit infections caused by viruses using ACE2 as membrane receptor. \n"," The RBD of spike protein 1 from SARS-CoV-2 was synthesized as described before [77] . Angiotensin II was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (A9525). Bradykinin was with CsOH).

[1] [2] [3] Among them, SARS-CoV was first reported in Guangdong, China in 2002. 4 SARS-CoV caused human-to-human transmission and resulted in the 2003 outbreak with about 10% case fatality rate (CFR), 1 while MERS-CoV was reported in Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 5 Even though with its limited human-tohuman transmission, MERS-CoV showed a CFR of about 34.4%. 2 The 2019-nCoV was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 from patients with pneumonia, 6 and it has exceeded both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in its rate of transmission among humans. 7 2019-nCoV was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), 8 while it was renamed HCoV-19, as a common virus name, by a group of virologists in China. 9 The disease and the virus causing it were named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) and the virus responsible for COVID-19 or the COVID-19 virus, respectively, by WHO. 3 As of March 5, 2020, a total of 95,333 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported, including 3,282 deaths, in China and at least 85 other countries and/or territories. 7 Currently, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown, and no effective prophylactics or therapeutics are available. This calls for the immediate development of vaccines and antiviral drugs for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.\n"," A coronavirus contains four structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. 2, 10, 11 Among them, S protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and it serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. 1, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The S protein mediates viral entry into host cells by first binding to a host receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit and then fusing the viral and host membranes through the S2 subunit. 16, 18, 19 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBDs recognize different receptors. SARS-CoV recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor, whereas MERS-CoV recognizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as its receptor. 20, 21 Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also recognizes ACE2 as its host receptor binding to viral S protein. 22 Therefore, it is critical to define the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 S protein as the most likely target for the development of virus attachment inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and vaccines.\n"," In this study, we identified the RBD fragment in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the recombinant RBD protein bound strongly to human ACE2 (hACE2) and bat ACE2 (bACE2) receptors. In addition, it blocked the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV into their respective hACE2-expressing cells, suggesting that it may serve as a viral attachment inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV RBDspecific polyclonal antibodies cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry into hACE2-expressing cells. We have also shown that SARS-CoV RBD-specific polyclonal antibodies could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccine for prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.\n"," By alignment of the RBD sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we identified the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD at residues 331 to 524 of S protein (Fig. 1a) . We then constructed a recombinant RBD protein containing codon-optimized RBD sequences with a Cterminal Fc of human IgG1 (hFc) using pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 expression vector, expressed the protein in mammalian cell 293T, and purified it from cell culture supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBD protein controls, SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein had high expression with strong purity (Fig. 1b) . Notably, only SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs were recognized by SARS-CoV RBD-specific, but not MERS-CoV RBD-specific, polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1c) , whereas only MERS-CoV RBD was recognized by MERS-CoV RBD-immunized polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1d ), suggesting the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein.\n"," Four experiments were performed to detect the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 receptor. First, we tested if stably transfected hACE2/293T cells expressed hACE2 by flow cytometry analysis. Since 293T cells alone did not express either hACE2 or hDPP4, they could not be recognized by anti-hACE2 or anti-hDPP4 antibodies ( Fig. 2a (left panel) ). Only hACE2/293T cells, but not hDPP4/293T cells, expressed hACE2, which was recognized by an anti-hACE2 antibody ( Fig. 2a (middle panel) ), whereas only hDPP4/293T cells, but not hACE2/293T cells, expressed hDPP4 and was, correspondingly, recognized by an anti-hDPP4 antibody ( Fig. 2a (right panel) ). These data confirmed the expression of hACE2 in hACE2/293T cells and the expression of hDPP4 in hDPP4/293T cells. Second, we used these hACE2/ 293T cells to detect the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein to cellassociated hACE2 by flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Similar to SARS-CoV RBD, SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to hACE2/293T cells expressing hACE2 (Fig. 2b (left and middle panels)), but not to hDPP4/293T cells expressing hDPP4 ( Fig. 2c (left and middle panels) ). Furthermore, the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2-expressing 293T cells was much stronger than the binding between SARS-CoV RBD and hACE2-expressing 293T cells (Fig. 2b (left and middle panels) ). MERS-CoV RBD did not bind to hACE2-expressing 293T cells ( Fig. 2b (right panel) ), but rather bound to hDPP4-expressing 293T cells (Fig. 2c (right panel) ). The results from immunofluorescence staining revealed positive signals for both hACE2 and hFc on hACE2/293T cells treated with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD, both of which contained a C-terminal hFc tag, whereas hACE2/293T cells treated with MERS-CoV RBD (containing a Cterminal hFc tag) showed positive signals for hACE2, but not for hFc, indicating that there is no binding of MERS-CoV RBD to the 4) . b, c Flow cytometry analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to cell-associated hACE2 receptor in hACE2/293T stable cell lines. SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein bound strongly to hACE2/293T cells (b (left panel, red line)), but not to hDPP4/293T cells (c (left panel, violet line)). SARS-CoV RBD protein bound to hACE2/293T cells (b (middle panel, red line)), but not to hDPP4/293T cells (c (middle panel, violet line)). MERS-CoV RBD protein did not bind to hACE2/293T cells (b (right panel, red line)), but rather bound to hDPP4/293T cells (c (right panel, violet line)). Human IgG Fc (hIgG-Fc, hereinafter hFc) protein-incubated cells (blue line) and mock-incubated cells (gray shading) were included as controls (b, c). Representative images and MFI ± s.e.m. were shown (n = 4). d Immunofluorescence detection of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to cell-associated hACE2 receptor in hACE2/293T cells. SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (green) and SARS-CoV RBD protein (green), each of which was fused with a C-terminal hFc, were stained with FITC-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody (1:500). hACE2 was stained with a goat-anti-hACE2 antibody (5 μg/ml) and Alexa-Fluor 647-labeled anti-goat antibody (red) (1:200). Fc-fused MERS-CoV RBD protein did not bind to hACE2, so only hACE2 (red), but not RBD (green), was detected in hACE2/293T cells. Nuclei were stained with 4' ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). Scale bar: 10 μm. Representative images are shown. e Detection of dose-dependent binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein to soluble hACE2 (sACE2) receptor by ELISA. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to soluble hDPP4 (sDPP4) receptor (f), and the binding of both SARS-CoV RBD and MERS-CoV RBD proteins to sACE2 (e), or sDPP4 (f), were tested. Control: hFc protein. Data are presented as mean A450 ± s.e.m. (n = 4). 50% effective dose (EC 50 ) was calculated for the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD (black) or SARS-CoV RBD (red) and hACE2 protein (e, sACE2), or the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and hDPP4 protein (sDPP4, green) (f). g-i Flow cytometry analysis of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein binding to hACE2/293T cells by sACE2. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to hACE2/293T cells (g, h, green line) was blocked by sACE2 (g, black line), but not by sDPP4 (h, red line). hFc protein-incubated cells (blue line) and mock-incubated cells (gray shading) were included as controls (g, h). Representative images are shown. i The blocking ability of sACE2 or sDPP4, as described above, was expressed as MFI ± s.e.m. (n = 4). Low MFI correlates with high blockage. Experiments were repeated twice and yielded similar results hACE2-expressing cells (Fig. 2d) . These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD can bind to cell-associated hACE2, but not to hDPP4. Third, we detected the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to soluble hACE2 protein (sACE2) by ELISA. The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to sACE2 in a dosedependent manner and that the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and sACE2 with 50% effective dose (EC 50 ) of 1.07 μg/ml was stronger than that between SARS-CoV RBD and sACE2 (EC 50 : 1.66 μg/ml). In contrast, MERS-CoV RBD did not bind to sACE2 (Fig. 2e) . While neither SARS-CoV-2 RBD nor SARS-CoV RBD bound to sDPP4, MERS-CoV RBD strongly bound to sDPP4 (EC 50 : 0.92 μg/ml) (Fig. 2f) . These data suggest that both SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD could bind to hACE2 in solution, but not to hDPP4 in solution. Fourth, flow cytometry analysis further indicated that the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and cell-associated hACE2 receptor could be significantly blocked by sACE2 protein (Fig. 2g , i), but not by sDPP4 protein (Fig. 2h, i) . Taken together, the above results confirm that the identified SARS-CoV-2 RBD could bind to both cell-associated and soluble hACE2 proteins.\n"," Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also originates from bats. [22] [23] [24] Next, we detected the binding affinity of the identified SARS-CoV-2 RBD to bat ACE2 (bACE2) and compared this binding with that of SARS-CoV RBD. We transiently transfected a bACE2expressing plasmid into 293T cells and included a hACE2expressing plasmid as a control, followed by detection of fluorescence intensity 48 h later. Results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound strongly to 293T-expressed bACE2 with intensity similar to that of its binding to 293T-expressed hACE2 (Fig. 3a, c) , and that this binding occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3e, f) . In addition, the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 293T-expressed bACE2 (EC 50 : 0.08 μg/ml) or hACE2 (EC 50 : 0.14 μg/ml) was significantly higher than that between SARS-CoV RBD and 293T-expressed bACE2 (EC 50 : 0.96 μg/ml) or hACE2 (EC 50 : 1.32 μg/ml) (Fig. 3b, d-f ). Nevertheless, MERS-CoV RBD bound neither bACE2-nor hACE2-expressing 293T cells (Fig. 3) . These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RBD can bind to both bACE2 and hACE2 with significantly stronger binding than that of SARS-CoV RBD to either bACE2 or hACE2, supporting the bat origin of SARS-CoV-2. These results may partially explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than SARS-CoV.\n"," We then evaluated the potential of the identified SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein as an inhibitor of viral entry. To accomplish this, we first generated a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 by cotransfection of a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and a plasmid expressing S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into 293T cells, followed by collection of pseudovirus-containing supernatants. We then incubated serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein with hACE2/293T target cells, followed by the addition of pseudovirus and detection of inhibitory activity of infection. With the capacity for only one-cycle infection, S protein-expressing pseudovirus cannot replicate in the target cells. 25, 26 Therefore, the inhibition of pseudovirus infection represents inhibition of viral entry, as mediated by viral S protein. As expected, SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into hACE2expressing 293T cells in a dose-dependent manner with 50% inhibition concentration (IC 50 ) as low as 1.35 µg/ml. Interestingly, it also blocked the entry of SARS-CoV pseudovirus into hACE2expressing 293T cells with IC 50 of 5.47 µg/ml (Fig. 4a) . Similarly, SARS-CoV RBD protein blocked the entry of both SARS-CoV pseudovirus and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into hACE2-expressing 293T cells with IC 50 of 4.1 and 11.63 µg/ml, respectively (Fig. 4b) .\n"," In addition, neither SARS-CoV-2 RBD nor SARS-CoV RBD blocked the entry of MERS-CoV pseudovirus into hDPP4-expressing 293T cells (Fig. 4c) . MERS-CoV RBD did not block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus or SARS-CoV pseudovirus into hACE2-expressing 293T cells, but it did block the entry of MERS-CoV pseudovirus into hDPP4-expressing 293T cells (IC 50 : 22.25 µg/ml) (Fig. 4a-c) .\n"," These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein could be developed as an effective therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.\n"," Since SARS-CoV-2 is more phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, 22 we further detected the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and crossneutralizing activity of SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. First, we performed an ELISA to detect the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV RBD-immunized mouse sera with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 RBD reacted strongly with anti-SARS-CoV RBD IgG with antibody titer of 1:2.4 × 10 4 (Fig. 4d) , but it did not react with anti-MERS-CoV RBD IgG (Fig. 4e) . As expected, SARS-CoV RBD reacted strongly with anti-SARS-CoV RBD IgG (antibody titer: 1:1.4 × 10 5 ) (Fig. 4d ), but not with anti-MERS-CoV RBD IgG (Fig. 4e) . MERS-CoV RBD did not react with anti-SARS-CoV RBD IgG (Fig. 4d) , but instead reacted with anti-MERS-CoV RBD IgG (antibody titer: 1:1.3 × 10 5 ) (Fig. 4e) . Second, we performed a pseudovirus neutralization assay to detect the cross-neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV RBD-immunized mouse sera against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Results revealed that SARS-CoV RBD-specific antisera could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection with a neutralizing antibody titer of 1:323, while these antisera could neutralize SARS-CoV pseudovirus infection with higher neutralizing antibody titer (1:1.2 × 10 4 ) (Fig. 4f) . MERS-CoV RBD-inducing mouse sera only neutralized MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection in hDPP4-expressing cells with a neutralizing antibody titer of 1:4 × 10 4 (Fig. 4g) , but failed to neutralize infection by either SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus or SARS-CoV pseudovirus (Fig. 4f) . These data suggest that SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection.\n"," In summary, we have characterized the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein which exhibits strong binding to its cell-associated and soluble ACE2 receptors with human and bat origin. This RBD protein also demonstrated significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 than SARS-CoV RBD. SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein could block S proteinmediated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and SARS-CoV pseudovirus entry into their respective ACE2 receptor-expressing target cells, suggesting the potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein as a viral attachment or entry inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV RBD-induced antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, indicating that SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies may be used for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and that either SARS-CoV RBD protein or SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein may be used as a candidate vaccine to induce cross-reactive or cross-neutralizing antibodies for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV infection. Taken together, this study provides an essential foundation for the design and development of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-based vaccines and therapeutics.\n"," The construction, expression, and purification of recombinant RBD proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV were performed as previously described with some modifications. 27, 28 Briefly, genes encoding residues 331-524 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, residues 318-510 of SARS-CoV S protein, or residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV S proteins, were amplified by PCR using codonoptimized SARS-CoV-2 S protein (GenBank accession number: QHR63250.1), SARS-CoV S protein (GenBank accession number: AY278488.2), or MERS-CoV S protein (GenBank accession number: AFS88936.1), as respective template, and fused into pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 expression vector (hereinafter named hFc; InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). The RBD proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells, secreted into cell culture supernatants, and purified by protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA).\n"," The purified RBD proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as previously described. 27, 29 Briefly, proteins were separated by 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% fat-free milk in PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST) for 2 h at 37°C and further incubated with SARS-CoV RBD-specific polyclonal antibody (mouse sera, 1:3,000), 30 or MERS-CoV RBD-specific antibody (mouse sera, 1:3,000), 31 overnight at 4°C. The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 1 h at room temperature and then visualized with ECL Western blot substrate reagents and Amersham Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare).\n"," Flow cytometry analysis Flow cytometry analysis was performed to detect the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein to hACE2 receptor in 293T cells stably expressing hACE2 (hACE2/293T). 26, 32 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBDs, as well as 293T cells stably expressing hDPP4 receptor (hDPP4/293T), were used as controls.

PEDV belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus, the family of Coronaviridae and the subfamily of Coronavirinae [3] . PEDV encodes several structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N) [4] [5] [6] . PEDV infection causes 80 to 100% fatality rates in suckling piglets [7] . It was originally reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom [8] . PEDV outbreaks emerged in the United States in 2013 [9] [10] [11] . In 2014, PEDV swept through three farms in South-Western Germany [12] . More importantly, PEDV has been proposed to be a potential threat to other species, especially humans [13] . Currently, no antiviral drugs are available to control the infection of PEDV.\n"," Glycyrrhizin (GLY) is the major component of licorice root extracts, which is the most intensively investigated bioactive compound in licorice root (Glycyrrhiza Radix) [14] . GLY is a glycosylated saponin, containing one molecule of glycyrretinic acid and two molecules of glucuronic acid [15, 16] . It has been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal herb for treating hepatitis because of its anti-inflammatory properties [17] . GLY possesses several beneficial activities including expectorant, anti-ulcer, antiallergy, anti-coagulative, anti-oxidative, antiviral, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory activities [18] [19] [20] [21] . The mechanism of how GLY exerts these diverse effects remains largely unclear.\n"," The antiviral effect of GLY has been reported previously on various viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus [22] , influenza virus [23] , severe acute respiratory syndrome [24] , herpes simplex type 1 [25] , hepatitis A [16] and B virus [26] . However, an antiviral effect of GLY against PEDV has not yet been reported.\n"," GLY is a competitive inhibitor of high mobility group box1 (HMGB1) that can inhibit the cytokine activity of HMGB1 [27] . Extracellular HMGB1 functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and activates proinflammatory signaling pathways by activating pattern recognition receptors including Toll-like receptors-2, -4 [28, 29] and the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) [30, 31] . HMGB1 is a unique mediator of innate immune responses and inflammation-associated events [32] [33] [34] [35] . In addition, extracellular HMGB1 contributes to the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] .\n"," In our studies, we first explored the antiviral effect of GLY against PEDV infection. Next, we revealed that GLY inhibited entry and replication of PEDV. In addition, we demonstrated that GLY also decreased the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines. We also confirmed that TLR4 and RAGE (receptors for HMGB1) might be associated with PEDV infection-related pathogenesis.\n"," The African green monkey kidney cell line (Vero) was cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (16010-159, GiBCO).

The infected cells were further incubated for 24 h in the presence of GLY before western blotting analysis, which showed that PEDV-N protein expression was moderately reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A) , demonstrating the antiviral activity of GLY against PEDV infection in Vero cells. The antiviral activity of GLY was further confirmed by qRT-PCR assay, which showed that GLY treatment resulted in, approximately, a 70% reduction of viral ORF3 gene expression at a concentration of 0.8 mM (Fig. 1B) . A similar dose-dependent inhibition of virus infection was observed in the plaque formation assay (Fig. 1C) . The cytotoxicity experiment showed GLY did not cause significant cytotoxic effects in Vero cells (at concentrations up to 0.8 mM for 24 h) (Fig. 1D ).

The un-internalized PEDV was washed away with the citric acid solution. The cells were immediately subjected to western blot analysis of PEDV-N protein. The result revealed that PEDV-N protein levels were decreased in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2A) .

PEDV-N protein levels in the infected cells were analyzed at 4, 8 and 12 hpi by western blot (Fig. 2B) . The result showed PEDV-N expression was inhibited by GLY. In addition, viral ORF3 RNA levels were also decreased after GLY treatment, as demonstrated by qRT-PCR analysis at 4 hpi (*25%), 8 hpi (*33.3%) and 12 hpi (54.5%) (Fig. 2C) . The results suggested that GLY inhibited the replication of PEDV.\n"," To study the effect of GLY on virus assembly, we analyzed RNA levels of the PEDV-ORF3 gene in supernatant and in cells. Vero cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 h with different concentrations of GLY after Vero cells had been infected with PEDV (1 h). The supernatant and the cells were collected for qRT-PCR analysis. The ratio between ORF3 RNA levels in the supernatant and in the cells was similar between GLY-treated and mock-treated samples (data not shown), indicating that GLY might not affect PEDV assembly.\n"," To determine whether GLY affected virus release, virus titers in the supernatant and in cells were determined using a plaque formation assay. Vero cells were incubated with different concentrations of GLY after Vero cells had already been infected. The cells were freeze-thawed three times after PBS washing. The plaque formation assay revealed the virus titer ratio between supernatant and cells was similar between GLY-treated and mock-treated cells (data not shown), suggesting that GLY might not affect virus release either.\n"," Low amounts of proinflammatory cytokines may be protective against viral invasion. However, overproduced cytokines will sabotage the host immune responses [44] . It is reported that host cells initiate immune responses by producing various proinflammatory cytokines during the infection of various viruses, including West Nile virus [45] , SARS-CoV [46] [47] [48] , and hepatitis (A, B, C) viruses [49] . Therefore, we studied whether GLY treatment affected the levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs during PEDV infection. Our data showed that PEDV infection increased the mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, while GLY treatment decreased the mRNA levels of these cytokines at 6, 12 and 24 hpi: IL-1b (20%, 49%, 75%), IL-6 (39%, 53%, 80%), IL-8 (46%, 47%, 94%), and TNF-a (51%, 56%, 91%) (Fig. 3A, B and C) .\n"," Since we had previously found that GLY treatment affected PEDV entry, we performed another experiment to rule out the possibility that the effect of GLY on proinflammatory cytokines might be caused by a decrease in the MOI. The cells were first infected with PEDV for 1 h to enable virus entry. Unbound viruses were then removed using the citric acid solution. The infected cells were then incubated with GLY before the first round of virus release into the extracellular environment (6 h). We analyzed the levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs at 4 hpi by qRT-PCR, and revealed that GLY indeed decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs: namely IL-1b (12%), IL-6 (34%), IL-8 (33%), and TNF-a (41%) (Fig. 3D ). All these results suggest that GLY treatment attenuated the proinflammatory responses of the cells during virus infection.\n"," GLY is a competitive inhibitor of High Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB1). Many studies have found that HMGB1 induces proinflammatory cytokine expression through the TLR4 signal pathway. When HMGB1 exerts its effect through TLR4, a disulfide bond forms between Cys23 and Cys45 [50] and a reduced Cys106 in HMGB1 is required [51] . We therefore constructed three HMGB1 mutants to investigate their effects on virus infection. Vero cells were transfected for 12 h with HMGB1 mutant plasmids HMGB1-C45S, HMGB1-C106S, HMGB1-C45S/C106S or control plasmid pCAGGS-HA (PCA) before PEDV infection (MOI=0.1). The cells were collected at 24 hpi for western blot analysis. The expression of HMGB1-C45S, C106S and C45S/C106S was confirmed (shown in Fig. 4A ). PEDV-N protein expression levels decreased about 29%, 20%, and 48% in HMGB1-C45S, C106S, and C45S/C106S over-expressing cells, respectively (Fig. 4A) . The RNA levels of the viral ORF3 gene were also decreased by approximately 51%, 20%, and 65% in HMGB1-C45S, C106S, and C45S/C106S over-expressing cells, respectively (Fig. 4B ). In addition, the effect of the double mutant on mRNA levels of IL-1b, IL-8, and TNF-a was more significant when compared to the single mutants (Fig. 4C) .\n"," RAGE is one of the main receptors of HMGB1 [52] . We knocked down RAGE expression by siRNA to determine the influence of RAGE on PEDV infection. As expected, a decline in PEDV-N expression and PEDV ORF3 RNA levels (62%) was observed after RAGE knockdown (85% knockdown efficiency) (Fig. 5A, B, C) . We determined the effect of RAGE knockdown on infection using the plaque formation assay, which showed that the virus titer in the supernatant was decreased (Fig. 5D) . Furthermore, siRAGE treatment significantly reduced the levels of IL-1b (23%), IL-6 (22%), IL-8 (25%), and TNF-a (52%) mRNA, when compared to NC-treated cells (Fig. 5E ). Based on these experiments, we concluded that HMGB1 might exert its biological function through TLR4 and RAGE during PEDV infection in Vero cells.\n"," Glycyrrhizin (GLY), the main component of licorice root extracts, inhibits the infection of many viruses. In our studies, we revealed that GLY could moderately inhibit PEDV infection in Vero cells (Fig. 1) . It was reported previously that GLY affects porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) entry [53] and inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV in vitro [24] . In our studies, we also demonstrated that GLY inhibited the entry and replication of PEDV, but had no effects on virus assembly and release.\n"," GLY is a competitive inhibitor of high mobility group box1 (HMGB1) that can inhibit the cytokine activity of HMGB1. Our previous studies show that PEDV infection results in the acetylation and release of HMGB1, which would promote the release of proinflammatory cytokines [54] . In this study, we demonstrated that GLY inhibited the increase in proinflammatory cytokines induced by PEDV infection (at the mRNA level) (Fig. 3A, B, C) . A similar result was observed in infected cells which were treated with GLY after virus internalization (Fig. 3D) .\n"," HMGB1 binding to TLR4 to trigger cytokine release requires the reduced C106, and a disulfide bond between C23 and C45 in HMGB1 [55] . Our studies on HMGB1 mutants (C45S, C106S, and C45S/106S) corroborates that extracellular HMGB1 binding to TLR4 promotes inflammatory responses (Fig. 4) , implying that the correct redox state of HMGB1 is essential for its cytokine activity. We also confirmed the involvement of RAGE in PEDV pathogenesis using a RAGE knockdown experiment (Fig. 5) .\n"," Our studies suggest GLY could be used as an immunomodulatory agent against PEDV infection because our in vitro experiments showed that PEDV infection results in a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines, whereas GLY treatment attenuated the production of these cytokines accompanied by a decrease in virus infectivity. An animal experiment shows that suckling pigs and weaned pigs infected by PEDV release a large amount of TNF-a at different time points, while serum IL-8 levels were, remarkably, higher in infected weaned pigs when compared to infected suckling pigs [56] . Although the study did not determine the expression levels of other proinflammatory cytokines, we suspect PEDV infection might cause the un-controlled release of cytokines in pigs. The aberrant release of cytokines has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. Proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production locally, or in other organs, induces inflammation and cellular infiltration in to the lamina propria and other layers of the intestinal wall, which subsequently causes diarrhea and finally dehydration [57] . Therefore, we propose that manipulation of the proinflammatory responses by a chemical agent such as GLY will attenuate the severe impact of PEDV infection on animals.\n"," GLY has been shown to protect vital organs against porcine endotoxemia through modulation of systemic inflammatory responses, by reducing the protein and mRNA levels of HMGB1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines [58] . It is known that administration of large amount of GLY (licorice extract) causes hypokalemia and serious hypertension in both animals and humans [59, 60] , but these effects are reversible after GLY withdrawal [61] . Hence, short-term administration of GLY or its derivatives might not lead to significant harm to animals.\n"," Collectively speaking, our study suggested GLY might be used as an immunomodulatory agent

Charadriformes, are thought to be the principal natural reservoir of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses [1, 2] , as well as the source of influenza A viruses infecting all other animals [3] . Indeed, LPAI includes nearly all influenza subtypes, and wild bird migration can bring viruses to new areas and species [1, 4] . The LPAI A(H7N9) virus was first identified in humans in China in early 2013 [5] . As at 15 October 2015, 678 confirmed human infections have been documented, with a case fatality rate of ca 40% [6] . The virus most probably originated in wild bird populations [7, 8] , was introduced into domestic ducks and chickens and has since become well established in poultry populations in south-eastern China [6] . Transmission to humans occurs primarily at live bird markets (LBMs), where direct contact between humans and infected poultry leads to spillover transmission [9] .\n"," Human influenza A(H7N9) infections have been well documented by the Chinese government and public health authorities. Outbreaks of human influenza A(H7N9) cases peak in winter months [10] and geographical diffusion from the eastern to the southern region of China has been observed [11] . As is true for most LPAI viruses, influenza A(H7N9) does not produce significant illness in domestic poultry, implying that poultry can be infected asymptomatically [6] . Consequently, poultry infections are likely to be under-reported even though LBMs are being closely and actively monitored [12, 13] . This limited, partial observation of influenza A(H7N9) infection in poultry poses a challenge to the study and quantification of the transmission potential of H7N9 viruses in poultry populations, as well as spillover transmission from poultry to humans. However, owing to the transmission link between influenza A(H7N9) infection in poultry and human infection through LBMs [9] , and because human influenza A(H7N9) cases have been well documented, these human cases serve as a sentinel proxy for infection rates among domestic poultry.\n"," Mathematical approaches can be used to infer critical epidemiological processes and parameters. Traditional methods of epidemic curve fitting regard the increase in cumulative cases as an exponential with set doubling times [14] . This approach uses surveillance data during the early exponential growth period of an outbreak to provide retrospective estimates of R0 [15, 16] . However, these estimates rely on specific assumptions, such as the initial susceptibility of the population and the infectious period. In contrast, a Bayesian approach [17] can provide continuous estimation of all system parameters without specific assumptions and is therefore more suitable for nonlinear epidemic modelling. In previous work, we used Bayesian inference methods to infer disease transmission dynamics, estimate critical epidemiological parameters, and generate forecasts of seasonal and pandemic human influenza (i.e. H1N1, H3N2, B) in both temperate [18] [19] [20] and subtropical regions [21] .\n"," Here we used human case data and a combined framework of mathematical model and Bayesian inference to simulate influenza A(H7N9) virus transmission among poultry and generate retrospective forecasts of influenza A(H7N9) incidence for both poultry and humans in the eastern and southern regions of China ( Figure 1 ).\n"," Specifically, human influenza A(H7N9) case data in the period from 2013 to 2015 were used in conjunction with a model-inference framework that combines a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model of influenza A(H7N9) virus transmission among poultry and the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) to simulate influenza A(H7N9) virus transmission among poultry, estimate critical epidemiological parameters,\n"," Spatial distribution of human influenza A(H7N9) cases and classification of study regions, China, 19 February 2013-19 September 2015 (n = 526) \n"," The human influenza A(H7N9) cases (black dots indicate case locations) in the study area are grouped into the eastern region (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui provinces: pink) and the southern region (Guangdong, Fujian and Hunan provinces: blue). These cases are shown in the whole map of China and the enlarged map of the study area. Also shown is the South Sea but with no human cases. and generate forecasts of influenza A(H7N9) infections for both humans and poultry. From 19 February 2013 until 19 September 2015, a total of 526 human influenza A(H7N9) cases were extracted from official reports of the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) in China. Associated record attributes included location, observation and reporting date, and descriptive information including age, sex and contact history.\n"," These records were processed into biweekly counts during the 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons and aggregated into two spatial regions, the southern region (Guangdong, Fujian and Hunan provinces) and the eastern region (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui provinces). This spatial grouping was based on the geographical location, common sources for poultry and virus spatial transmission patterns among the provinces. Specifically, provinces in the same region are geographically conjoined, and influenza A(H7N9) virus appeared to diffuse from the eastern region, where chicken farming and consumption occur locally, to the southern region where chickens are imported from northern China (e.g. Hebei and Shandong provinces).\n"," The epidemical model used for this study simulates the transmission of influenza A(H7N9) among poultry as well as spillover transmission from poultry to humans. The model is described by the following equations:\n"," where S is the number of susceptible poultry, Ic and Ih are the number of infectious poultry and humans, respectively, N is chicken population size, β is the contact rate among poultry, D is the mean infectious period, and γ is the scaling factor linking the number of infected poultry with human infections. The basic reproductive rate, R0, is calculated from the infection rate and mean infectious period as R0 = β D, while the effective reproductive rate is also determined from susceptibility as Re = R0 S / N. This modelling framework was implemented with the assumption of homogenous mixing among chicken and human populations, indicating that spillover transmission from poultry to human was constant through time and that no transmission among humans occurred. In essence, we used human influenza A(H7N9) case data as a proxy for infection among poultry. We took this approach because infections among poultry are likely to be greatly under-reported and human influenza A(H7N9) incidence data are much more reliable.\n"," The EAKF is a sequential Monte Carlo, or data assimilation, method that is used to iteratively update the model state variables and parameters with each new observation [22] . This update follows Bayes' rule:\n"," where Zt is the system state, including model variables and parameters S, Ic, Ih, D, R0, and yt is the observation at time t. Formula 4 shows that the updated (i.e. posterior) probability distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood of the occurrence of new observations given the current system state and the prior probability distribution of the system state. The EAKF uses an assumption of normality for the likelihood and prior distribution. In doing so, only the first two statistical moments are needed to characterise the distributions on the right hand side of Formula 4.\n"," The EAKF was selected for iterative Bayesian inference in this work because it was already being used for state space estimation in the geosciences (e.g. climate and weather simulation and prediction) and also in conjunction with influenza state space models to generate seasonal influenza forecasts [18, 19, 21] .\n"," All simulations of influenza A(H7N9) transmission and incidence among poultry and spillover transmission to humans with the model-inference system (i.e. the SIR dynamic model and EAKF inference) were run using a 300-member ensemble of simulations. These simulations were run simultaneously and linked through the EAKF. Before integration with the model equations, each simulation (i.e. ensemble member) was randomly assigned an initial combination of state variables and parameters from specified uniform distributions (see below). These comprised the initial conditions, or 'initial prior', for each simulation before integration. Each initialised ensemble member was then integrated through time using the equations of the model; as each simulation has a different initial array of state variables and parameters, the trajectory of each simulation differs. The ensemble was integrated until the time point of the first observation at which the run was halted and the EAKF algorithm and observation were used to update the ensemble mean and variance of the observed state variable (here incidence) according to Formula 4, as well as all the unobserved variables and parameters [19, 22] . The conditions upon halting before the EAKF update are termed the 'prior'; the conditions after the EAKF update are termed the 'posterior'. The mean prior and posterior are averages across the ensemble; for example, the mean prior and posterior of susceptibility (S) is simply the ensemble average value of S before and after EAKF updating at a particular point in time.\n"," The use of an ensemble of simulations provided an easy means of estimating credible intervals and uncertainties, both for parameter estimates and forecasts. Indeed, for the EAKF, the prior and posterior moments (i.e. mean and variance) can be calculated directly from the average prior and posterior estimates of all the 300 ensemble members. Time series of 300-member ensemble mean posterior (red) and prior (blue) for key epidemiological variables (susceptibility (S) and the number of infections in chicken (Ic)), and for parameters (the infectious period (D), chicken-to-chicken contact rate (β) and the effective and basic reproductive rate (Re and R0)), during different seasons and regions. In each season, variables and parameters were adjusted from the beginning of the season to the two-week period with the last recorded case. Both the prior and posterior mean estimates are shown; EAKF adjustment at a given time is the difference of the mean posterior minus the mean prior.\n"," The described cycle of integration and adjustment was repeated for each successive observation, i.e. after updating, the posterior was integrated through time until the next observation, at which point it became the prior. Then the EAKF and observation were used to generate a new posterior. Through this iterative updating process, the estimates of the state variables and parameters converge to a combination capable of simulating the outbreak as observed up to that point. The intention was that by optimising the model to simulate conditions as observed from the past to present, a better forecast of the future can be generated using that optimised ensemble of simulation.\n"," The state variable-parameter vector of the SIR-EAKF framework included optimisation of three variables (S, Ic and Ih) and two parameters (D and R0). At the beginning of each outbreak, we initialised each simulation (i.e. each ensemble member) using a random selection from uniform ranges of the parameters and variables (2 < D < 10 days, 0.01 < R0 < 2.0, 0.5 < S0 < 0.6, 0 < Ic0 < 250). These initial uniform ranges were based on prior modelling efforts simulating and forecasting human seasonal influenza [18, 20] . In addition, as the transmission potential of influenza A(H7N9) virus among poultry is not well described, a broad initial prior range for R0 was used; however, note that the EAKF in the presence of observations can adjust the model parameters and variables to values outside these initial ranges. A Latin hypercube sampling approach was used to generate a near-random initial prior sample across this multidimensional distribution of parameter and variable values.\n"," Multiplicative inflation was used to increase the ensemble variance of all model variables and parameters by 2% before EAKF adjustment. Inflation is commonly applied to ensemble Kalman filters in order to avoid 'filter divergence', the situation in which the variance across the ensemble of simulations has contracted so much that the EAKF updating algorithm \n"," Top panels: Accuracy was measured as the percentage of ensembles predicting (A) the week with the most human influenza A(H7N9) cases within one week of the observed peak week and (B) the peak magnitude of human influenza A(H7N9) cases within 25% of the observed peak magnitude. It is presented as a function of the forecast week relative to observed (blue) and predicted (green) peak timing.\n"," Bottom panels: Forecasts initiated (C) 4 weeks, (D) 2 weeks and (E) 0 weeks ahead of the observed peak week for the southern region during the 2013/14 season. The SIR model was recursively optimised up to the week of forecast initiation using observations (black x) and the EAKF; the red x are future observations which were not used in the model optimisation. The black and green lines are the mean trajectory of the ensemble and areas shaded grey and green are the 5th and 95th percentiles of the ensemble posterior for simulation and forecast periods, respectively. effectively ignores the observations and model simulations diverge from the truth [22] . The 300-member ensemble simulations were repeated 10 times each season to account for stochastic effects due to the random selection of initial conditions. The average of the 10 repeated runs, each made up of a 300-member ensemble simulation, was used to derive mean posterior estimates of the model parameters.\n"," Several epidemiological parameters are critical for characterising the transmission potential of infectious diseases. The basic reproductive number R0, defined as the number of secondary infections an infectious host would produce in a completely susceptible population, signals the potential of an infectious agent to start an outbreak as well as the transmissibility of a virus in the absence of intervention. The effective reproductive number Re quantifies the transmission force during the actual outbreak and can be used to monitor the impact of control strategies. An Re > 1 indicates epidemic growth, while an Re < 1 indicates that sustained transmission cannot persist and that an outbreak will subside.\n"," Epidemiological parameters, namely β, D, R0 and Re, were estimated for each of three seasons and two regions from the start of the season to the last twoweek period with a recorded case. In a given season, the posterior mean and interquartile range of Ic, Ih, β, D, R0 and Re were estimated at the time of maximal epidemic forcing or the time point of highest transmission potential, i.e. the two-week period with the highest effective reproductive number. The level of initial susceptibility, however, was defined as and estimated for the two-week period with maximal susceptibility. We have previously presented parameter estimates at these key time points in studies of seasonal influenza [18, 20] . The prior and posterior means during each outbreak for each variable and parameter were also recorded ( Figure 2 ).\n"," Parameter estimate changes during the entirety of an outbreak were used to inspect filter adjustment. Such parameter changes over time may reflect changes in the estimation or actual changes to the parameter values. For the former, the observations contain noise and the estimation of the parameters by the EAKF is neither perfect nor instantaneous; consequently, the parameter estimates move through time. For the latter, actual shifts in parameter value can occur, e.g. representing changing contact rates and control measures, as the pathogen moves through different subpopulations and/or geographical areas.\n"," The parameter estimates were inferred using a scaling γ, representing a rate of spillover transmission from chicken to human, equal to 300. This value was selected following tests with γ ranging from 100 to 1,000 in increments of 100. For each value of γ, mean human case forecast error was used to calculate total outbreak root mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation, as well as attack rate error, peak weak error and peak magnitude error between observations and the predicted estimates. A ranking approach was used to identify the scaling with the lowest error. Specifically, for each metric (RMSE, correlation, attack rate error, peak weak error and peak magnitude error), the scaling levels were ranked. The scaling with the highest overall rank, i.e. γ = 300, was selected and used in all simulations and forecasts presented here.\n"," Retrospective forecasts were run for the seasons 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15 for the eastern region and for the last two seasons for the southern region. The model-inference system was again implemented IQR: interquartile range. The posterior means and IQR of the number of chicken infections (I c ), chicken-to-chicken contact rate (β), the infectious period (D) and the basic reproductive rate (R 0 ) were estimated at maximal epidemic forcing (maximal R e ). The level of initial susceptibility (S) was defined and estimated in the two-week period with maximal susceptibility.\n"," using 300-member ensembles and reinitialised with randomly selected variable and parameter combinations at the beginning of each season. All simulations and forecasts were repeated 10 times for each outbreak and were initialised with a random selection of parameter and variable values, as described above. Forecasts were generated beginning with the two-week period of the first recorded case and repeated every 2 weeks following the generation of a new posterior. Specifically, for the eastern region, separate ensemble forecasts were run from the 4th to 9th, 2nd to 17th and 3rd to 9th two-week period for the 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons, respectively; for the southern region, forecasts were generated from the 3rd to 19th and 5th to 12th two-week period for the last two seasons.\n"," To evaluate the accuracy of our SIR-EAKF system, we determined two measurements: the peak week and peak magnitude, or the percentage of ensemble mean trajectories predicting human influenza A(H7N9) case peak timing within ± 1 week of the observed peak week, and peak magnitude within ± 25% of the observed peak magnitude. These two indices were then plotted as a function of the relative forecast week, i.e. the week of forecast generation minus either the observed or predicted peak week, to show the relationship between predictive skill and lead time.\n"," The combined SIR-EAKF system was coded in R. These codes are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n"," The mean posterior estimates of human influenza A(H7N9) incidence produced by the model-inference system matched the observed influenza A(H7N9) human case counts well (Figure 3 ).\n"," These simulations captured the timing and magnitude of the epidemic. Mean posterior estimates of R0 ranged from 1.327 to 1.941 (Table 1) The susceptibility of the chicken population was high in earlier outbreaks and dropped to around 65% in more recent outbreaks. For the effective transmission number Re, which quantifies the transmission force during the outbreak, the mean posterior estimates were greater than 1 during four of the five outbreaks analysed here, indicating a clear transmission potential among LBM poultry. The Re estimate was highest during the initial outbreak in 2012/13 when the two associated parameters, R0 and susceptibility, were also highest. The scaling factor γ, selected by the rank correlation approach (see Methods) mapped the observed human cases to simulated poultry infections and indicated that the daily poultry-to-human spillover transmission rate was low, around 3.3 × 10-3 per infected LBM chicken.\n"," Estimates of all parameters remained stable during the seasons 2013/14 and 2014/15 in the southern region where outbreaks were of similar severity in both epidemic waves. However, there was an apparent decrease in R0, Re, β and susceptibility from the first to the third outbreak in the eastern region, which was in accordance with the change of outbreak severity in this region.\n"," The accuracy of the forecast for peak timing and magnitude increased as the week of forecast initiation got closer to the observed and predicted peak ( Figure 4 ). Accuracy was measured as the percentage of ensembles predicting the week with the most human cases of influenza A(H7N9) within ± 1 week of the observed peak week and the peak magnitude of human H7N9 influenza cases within ± 25% of observed peak magnitude. The values are the same as those in Figure 4 and presented as a function of the forecast lead time from 10 weeks before to 10 weeks after the observed and predicted peak timing.\n"," Specifically, the percentage of forecasts predicting the peak week within ± 1 week increased sharply from 6 weeks ahead of the observed peak week and reached 90% when a forecast was generated at the observed peak. For peak magnitude, the percentage of forecasts predicting the peak magnitude within ± 25% of the observed magnitude increased from 8 weeks before the observed peak, and almost all forecasts were accurate when predicting at the observed peak. However, as knowledge of the observed peak was unavailable for real-time forecasting, we also present overall accuracy as a function of predicted lead time. Here, the accuracy was 43% and 63% at 2 weeks lead time and 61% and 98% at 0 weeks lead time for peak timing and magnitude, respectively ( Table 2 ). Example forecasts are also presented in Figure 4 .\n"," Our findings indicate that data assimilation methods and a simple epidemic model can be combined to infer the transmission dynamics of H7N9 influenza in both chicken and human populations using only human infection data. Moreover, the model-inference system can produce accurate predictions of the peak timing and magnitude of human infections.\n"," The estimated potential of chicken-to-human spillover transmission was low, even with the high transmission rate among poultry. Specifically, estimates of R0 were greater than 1 and the mean contact rate among poultry was 0.326 across all seasons and regions, whereas the daily chicken-to-human infection rate reflected by the linkage parameter γ indicated that the mean number of human infections per infectious chicken was 3.3 × 10-3. Our estimates of R0, among poultry were similar to those of past pandemic influenza viruses in humans (e.g. 1.2-2.3 for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) [23] , which implies that influenza A(H7N9) has the potential to cause pandemics in chicken populations. This result is similar to earlier findings [24] ; however, our estimates for three other parameters, the mean infectious period, the basic reproductive rate and the chicken-to-human infection rate, were smaller, which may be due to the finer spatial and longer temporal scales used in this study, as well as the difference in modelling approach. Specifically, our study used a dynamic model, Bayesian inference framework and regional bi-weekly counts of human infections, covering three epidemic waves. Our findings thus represent more detailed, localised and long-term patterns of transmission dynamic than earlier work using least-square methods in conjunction with daily human infection data at the beginning of the outbreak at a national scale [24] .\n"," The dynamic patterns of influenza A(H7N9) differed in the two regions studied here, although with the limited number of outbreaks available for validation, these differences must be interpreted with caution. The transmission potential among chicken flocks and initial susceptibility decreased across three seasons in the eastern region, but remained stable in the southern region. These differences were dynamically consistent with observed outbreak severity in both regions and may have been caused by a difference in control methods implemented by the government. In the eastern region, approaches such as closing of LBMs [25, 26] and halting live poultry trade were implemented during the early stages of the outbreaks. This probably reduced chicken-to-human exposure and chicken-tochicken mixing and consequently may have attenuated the severity of the outbreak. On the other hand, for southern provinces such as Guangdong (where LBM closure was implemented later, in the second half of February 2014), co-circulation of a diverse array of avian influenza subtypes as well as multiple strains of H7N9 and H9N2 influenza viruses has been documented. This abundance of viruses creates an environment primed for influenza reassortment, resulting in diversified and more adaptive genotypes and a higher risk of infections in both poultry and humans [27, 28] and may therefore keep susceptibility high and stable across seasons.\n"," The mean estimate of D, the mean infectious period, for the 2012/13 outbreak in the eastern provinces was lower (3.95) than for the later outbreaks, which ranged from 5.29 to 5.94. Given the limited number of total outbreaks investigated, the exact causes for this difference are difficult to pinpoint; however, factors could include actual changes to the virus between the first and later outbreaks, errors in the observed number of cases or errors in the estimation process. That the 2013/14 and 2014/15 outbreaks yielded consistent estimates, including similar values for D and β, and decreasing maximal S over time suggests that these findings are credible.\n"," Our inference and forecasting framework was implemented with a simple SIR model and the assumption of homogeneous mixing among human and chicken populations, i.e. a constant chicken-to-human transmission rate. Our model only simulated chicken-to-chicken and chicken-to-human transmission (Formulas 1-3) and did not consider environmental transmission. Given the limited data on infection and transmission among poultry, inferred distinctions of alternate transmission modes, i.e. chicken-to-chicken vs environment-to-chicken, are likely to be poorly constrained. Further, prior attempts to simulate these different pathways suggest that the rates of chicken-to-environment shedding are low [29] . Loss of immunity was not modelled either, as birds are either slaughtered or, when infection is suspected, culled, as required by the Chinese government [30] .\n"," Despite these shortcomings, the combined modelinference system matched the observations well, and provided sensible estimates of key epidemiological parameters, including rates of chicken-to-human spillover infection. The analyses revealed the transmission potential of H7N9 influenza among poultry, the stability and changes of that transmission potential over time, and that real-time forecasting of influenza A(H7N9) incidence in both human and poultry is possible. In the future, such methods could be applied in real time to newly emerged avian influenza subtypes.\n","Score: 7.058602003216221\n","\n","Title: Influenza-and Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Morbidity and Mortality in the Nursing Home Population\n","Body Text: utbreaks of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated illness are common in nursing home settings. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] In temperate climates like the United States, these two viruses are usually confined to winter and typically cause seasonal outbreaks of respiratory illness. [9] [10] [11] Nursing home residents are confined in close contact with one another and staff, presenting easy opportunity for viral spread. In addition, the high prevalence of comorbid conditions increases the risk of serious morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and RSV infections.\n"," The effect of influenza and RSV in the nursing home population is incompletely described despite the fact that institutional outbreaks of influenza and RSV are well documented. Winter outbreaks result in attack rates of 10% to 40% for both viruses, RSV case-fatality rates of 2% to 20%, and influenza case-fatality rates of up to 55%. 2, 5, 8, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] One prospective study in a single nursing home over the 1989-90 winter season identified RSV as the most common viral cause of acute respiratory illness in residents. It was documented in 27% of respiratory illnesses and was more common than influenza. 18 To date, studies of nursing home patients have included only a small number of homes, usually over fewer than three winter seasons. Thus, such information about the effects of influenza and RSV may not be typical of morbidity in most nursing home residents during most years.\n"," This study describes the first population-based study of the effect of influenza and RSV specifically in the nursing home population. A retrospective cohort study of all per-sons residing in Tennessee nursing homes enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program was performed to determine rates of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, antibiotic use, and deaths during 4 consecutive years, August 1995 through July 1999. The rates of these events due to influenza and RSV were estimated using active viral surveillance to determine times these viruses were circulating in Tennessee. Tennessee Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that insures approximately 80% of persons residing in the 381 nursing homes in the state. Computerized medical data on this large population allowed quantifying the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and RSV in the statewide nursing home population.\n"," Linked Tennessee Medicaid files were used to define the cohort and identify outcomes of interest as previously described. 19 The enrollment file included age, sex, race, dates of enrollment, and date of death. The nursing home file included name and location of nursing home, defined as urban (Tennessee's four largest cities), other standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA), or rural (non-SMSA), and dates of nursing home use. Pharmacy files provided records of all filled prescriptions. Inpatient files provided dates of all hospitalizations and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition with Clinical Modifications (ICD-9-CM)-coded discharge diagnoses.\n"," The study population included all persons enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program for at least 1 year from August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1999, who were nursing home residents. Persons younger than 65 were excluded because this population was small (16% of eligible persontime) and demographically different (54% male, 39% in mental health facilities, 65% with no comorbid condition) from older residents. Persons entered the study on the first day after August 1, 1995, on which they were enrolled in Medicaid for at least 1 year and a nursing home resident. Persons were followed until loss of enrollment, movement out of the nursing home, or death or until July 31, 1999.\n"," The exposure, or season of viral activity, was defined based on active viral surveillance in middle Tennessee. Two sources of viral surveillance were used: all positive antigen tests and cultures for influenza, RSV, or parainfluenza viruses from the Vanderbilt University Hospital laboratory were identified, and a cohort of about 150 children, aged 5 and younger, were followed annually in the Vanderbilt Vaccine Clinic and cultured for these three viruses whenever they developed fever or respiratory symptoms. This hospital serves as a referral hospital for middle Tennessee for adults and children. By protocol, all children hospitalized for respiratory symptoms are cultured for RSV; cultures for other viruses are not consistently collected. Thus these data may not accurately reflect the actual level of individual viral activity.\n"," Influenza season began the first day of 2 consecutive weeks with at least two influenza isolates per week and ended the last day of the 2 consecutive weeks with at least two influenza isolates per week. RSV season was similarly defined but excluded those dates classified as influenza season. In each of the 4 years, the dates of influenza season were completely encompassed by RSV season. Thus, all person time and events in the study occurred in one of three exposure periods: RSV season, when only RSV was circulating; influenza season, when both influenza and RSV were circulating; and non-winter-viral season, when neither RSV nor influenza was circulating.\n"," All person-time and events after a medical encounter with diagnostic or procedure codes or filled prescriptions indicating selected comorbid conditions were classified as high risk, including (1) asthma or chronic lung disease (ICD-9-CM codes 277.0, 770.7, 491-496) or prescriptions filled for ␤ -agonists, theophylline, inhaled corticosteroids, ipratropium, cromolyn sodium, or leukotriene inhibitors; (2) diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM codes 250) or prescriptions filled for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents; (3) chronic heart disease (ICD-9-CM codes 393-398, 402-404, 410-414, 415-417, 425, 428, 429, 745-747, except 747.5-747.9); (4) cancer/immunosuppressed (ICD-9-CM codes 140-208.9, except 173) or prescriptions filled for chemotherapeutic agents or 60 days of oral corticosteroids; (5) chronic renal or liver disease (ICD-9-CM codes 581-583, 585, 587, 571, 303 or dialysis procedure codes); and (6) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (ICD-9-CM code 042) or prescriptions filled for HIV medications. These comorbid conditions were chosen based on the current recommendations for influenza immunization. All other person-time and events were classified as not high risk.\n"," Study outcomes were cardiopulmonary hospitalizations (ICD-9-CM-coded discharge diagnoses of pneumonia (480-486), influenza (487), acute respiratory conditions (460-466), other respiratory conditions (490-519), heart failure or myocarditis (422, 427, 428)); the number of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions filled; and death. Mortality data were obtained from linkage of Medicaid files to State of Tennessee death certificates for those deaths that occurred between 1995 and 1998. Mortality data for deaths in 1999 were not yet available from Tennessee and thus were obtained from the Medicaid database. During 3 years, 1995-98, when death certificates were available, Medicaid files captured 96% of the deaths that were linked to Tennessee death certificates each of the 3 years.\n"," The total person-time and number of hospitalizations due to cardiopulmonary events were tabulated during influenza, RSV, and nonwinter seasons. All person-time was grouped into strata based on risk status (no high-risk and high-risk condition). Within each risk group, rates of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations were calculated by dividing the risk-group-specific sum of all hospitalizations due to cardiopulmonary events by the risk-group-specific total person-years during influenza, RSV, and non-winter-viral seasons. These and all other rates were expressed per 1,000 person-years and were adjusted for the proportion of the year in each of the three specific seasons. Differences in hospitalization rates during influenza and RSV seasons were calculated as measures of influenza-attributable risk. Similarly, the RSV-attributable risk was calculated as the difference between these rates during the RSV and non-winterviral seasons. Standardized rate differences were calculated as the weighted average of the strata-specific differences in rates. Confidence intervals were computed based on large sample properties. 20 Similar analyses were performed for antibiotic courses and death rates.\n"," Residents in Tennessee's 381 nursing homes contributed 81,885 person-years of follow-up during the 4 study years. Twenty-three percent of total person-years occurred during influenza seasons when RSV was also circulating, 26% occurred during RSV seasons when only RSV was circulating, and 51% occurred during the remaining non-winterviral seasons. Demographic characteristics of residents reflected a typical nursing home population; 73% were in intermediate care facilities, and 48% were in homes in rural locations ( Table 1 ). The residents were predominantly women (79%) and white (83%), and 63% had at least one high-risk condition. There were 402 cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, 2,416 courses of antibiotics, and 296 deaths per 1,000 person-years.\n"," The two viral surveillance systems detected 1,105 RSV culture or antigen-positive tests and 235 influenza culture or antigen-positive tests and 77 parainfluenza-positive cultures during the 4 study years. The onset of RSV season ranged from mid-September to early November and averaged 26 weeks in length. The onset of influenza season ranged from late November to early January and averaged 12 weeks in length. Influenza A H3N2 viruses circulated in all 4 years; in addition, influenza A H1N1 virus circulated in the first year, and influenza B viruses were detected in every year except 1997-98. There was a mean of 4.8 positive influenza tests per week during the influenza season. Only four ( Ͻ 2%) positive tests occurred outside this time. The average number of positive RSV tests was slightly higher in influenza season (11.2 per week) than in RSV season (9.6 per week). There were few positive RSV tests in non-winter-viral season (0.3 per week). Values are weighted averages of annual excess events for a population of 1,000 persons within the specified age and risk group. The influenza excess events were calculated by multiplying the event rate difference between influenza and RSV by the proportion of overall study days in influenza season. The RSV excess events were calculated by multiplying the event rate difference between RSV and non-winter-viral season by the proportion of overall study days in RSV or influenza season (RSV circulated during both of these seasons). The weighted average difference in rates between influenza and RSV season and RSV season and non-winter-viral season were calculated with stratumspecific person-years in all seasons as weights; strata were defined by study year, race, sex, and nursing home location. † Percentage values are calculated by dividing the annual excess events attributable to influenza or RSV by the age and risk-group specific total event rate.\n"," Cardiopulmonary hospitalization rates were consistently higher in influenza seasons than in non-winter-viral season and, except for the first year, higher in RSV seasons (Figure 1A) . For the 4 years combined (Table 2) , residents without and with identified high-risk conditions both experienced similar seasonal increases in hospitalizations, with the peak during the portion of the year when both influenza and RSV were present. Influenza was associated with an estimated seven and 28 cardiopulmonary hospitalizations per 1,000 person-years in those without and with high-risk conditions, respectively. RSV was associated with an annual excess of six and 11 hospitalizations per 1,000 person-years in these two strata. Together, influenza and RSV were responsible for 15% of hospitalizations in residents with no other defined high-risk conditions and 7% in those in the high-risk group.\n"," There was a consistent winter excess of antibiotic courses in both risk groups; the greatest antibiotic prescribing rate occurred when both influenza and RSV were circulating ( Figure 1B , Table 3 ). The estimated numbers of excess antibiotic prescriptions during influenza season were 99 and 147 per 1,000 person-years, for those without and with high-risk conditions, respectively. RSV season was associated with an annual excess of 62 and 76 courses of antibiotics in those without and with high-risk conditions. In both risk groups, 8% to 9% of all antibiotic courses were attributable to these two viruses.\n"," Seasonal death rates in the influenza and RSV seasons were consistently higher than death rates in non-winterviral seasons and consistently peaked during influenza seasons ( Figure 1C) . It was estimated that influenza caused six and 15 deaths per 1,000 residents without and with high-risk conditions, respectively (Table 4 ). Estimated mortality due to RSV was higher, 16 and 17 deaths per 1,000 in those without and with identified high-risk conditions, respectively. In addition, these two winter viruses accounted for 14% and 9% of all deaths in nursing home residents in the two risk groups.\n"," This is the first population-based study to quantify the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza virus or RSV in a statewide nursing home population. Previous population-based studies did not specifically examine the nursing home population, and earlier studies based entirely on nursing homes evaluated only one or a few homes. Morbidity and mortality from influenza and RSV vary from year to year, from community to community, and from institution to institution, and an accurate estimate of disease burden requires temporal, geographic, and institutional breadth. These data, which included all nursing homes, more accurately reflect average risk over time; in any given year, a single nursing home could experience a large outbreak or no illness at all due to either of these viruses. Cardiopulmonary hospitalizations are high in nursing home residents. Among the majority of residents who had at least one high-risk condition, there was one hospitaliza- Values are weighted averages of annual excess events for a population of 1,000 persons within the specified age and risk group. The influenza excess events were calculated by multiplying the event rate difference between influenza and RSV by the proportion of overall study days in influenza season. The RSV excess events were calculated by multiplying the event rate difference between RSV and non-winter-viral season by the proportion of overall study days in RSV or influenza season (RSV circulated during both of these seasons). The weighted average difference in rates between influenza and RSV season and RSV season and non-winter-viral season were calculated with stratumspecific person-years in all seasons as weights; strata were defined by study year, race, sex, and nursing home location. † Percentage values are calculated by dividing the annual excess events attributable to influenza or RSV by the age and risk-group specific total event rate.

Although rates of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations were more than six times higher in residents with high-risk conditions, the percentage of hospitalizations attributable to winter viruses was similar in both risk groups, at 5% to 15%. The absolute hospitalization rates and the approximately equal etiological contribution of RSV and influenza validate what others have found in national studies of the general population, using hospital discharge data, and prospective studies in single nursing homes or communities. 7, 17, 18, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Recent surveillance data in communities confirm that influenza and RSV cause substantial morbidity in all age groups, with the contribution of each varying from year to year. 11 Nursing home residents were prescribed an average of 2.4 antibiotic courses per year. Influenza and RSV are important contributors to the large number of prescriptions filled, with the two viruses responsible for more than 8% of all courses of antibiotics in both risk groups. Perhaps most remarkably, between 9% and 14% of all deaths in persons residing in nursing homes were associated with the circulation of these two viruses. The etiological role of each virus in these deaths was virtually identical.\n"," Another notable finding in this study was the overwhelming hospitalization, antibiotic use, and death rates of persons with chronic medical problems. Others have reported that persons with chronic illnesses are at significantly greater risk for influenza infection and its complications. 30, 31 This study substantiates the finding and demonstrates the increase in hospitalization, antibiotic use, and death rates in high-risk elderly during RSV season as well.\n"," Regional viral surveillance was used for the middle Tennessee region, primarily in children, to define influenza and RSV seasons for all nursing homes in the state. Thus, these definitions are only approximate estimates of when the viruses were circulating in the state, but strong correlations between the timing of national and regional influenza viral activity and morbidity and mortality are well recognized. 10, 30 National data indicate that RSV typically peaks in winter months, with widespread activity for up to 6 months, and that there are distinct regional patterns. 32 Thus, use of regional viral surveillance data in a largely pediatric population to define statewide viral activity is reasonable but likely results in some misclassification of seasons.\n"," It was also assumed that influenza and RSV caused all excess cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, antibiotic courses, and deaths occurring during their respective seasons. This assumption requires that other viruses that cause respiratory illnesses, such as parainfluenza, coronavirus, and rhinovirus, were evenly divided throughout the three defined seasons and thus would not contribute to the seasonal differences in rates. This assumption is reasonable because influenza and RSV are the two main respiratory viruses with strong seasonal variations. 9 In addition, the surveillance data indicated that parainfluenza was most active in non-winter-viral months, which would result in an underestimation of the \"excess\" winter events when using non-winter viral as the baseline. Neither coronavirus nor rhinovirus was included in the surveillance, and a differential distribution of these viruses could result in an over-or underestimation of the effects of influenza and RSV. Other winter factors, such as cold temperature and increased time indoors, would presumably not be important because nursing home residents encounter little seasonal environmental change.\n"," The winter-viral-associated increase in hospitalization, antibiotic use, and death rates found in this study are particularly troublesome in light of the high rate of influenza vaccination in the nursing home population. During the time period of this study, estimates of influenza vaccination rates in nursing home residents were 64% to 83%. 33, 34 Although continuing to improve vaccination rates may be helpful, future research efforts should focus on additional methods of reducing influenza disease such as increasing staff vaccination rates, improving detection and treatment of influenza outbreaks, and appropriate use of prophylactic measures.\n"," In adults, RSV is difficult to diagnose, and treatment is largely supportive. There is currently no RSV vaccine licensed, although several RSV candidate vaccines are in human trials. Efforts at RSV prevention and detection are hindered by a low degree of suspicion for this illness in elderly adults. This lack of awareness may prove to be the greatest challenge to decreasing the effect of this illness.\n"," The findings of this study have strong implications for future research efforts. The data reflect the need for continued study of influenza vaccine coverage, efficacy, and effectiveness and development and testing of candidate RSV vaccines in adults and children. Also, additional studies are needed to assess the role of education and other methods of prevention and treatment of illness due to both of these winter viruses in the nursing home population.\n","Score: 6.980442869352452\n","\n","Title: Household transmission of seasonal coronavirus infections: Results from the Flu Watch cohort study [version 1; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]\n","Body Text: Understanding household transmission parameters is important for outbreak modelling and response as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) becomes established in communities worldwide. While studies are currently underway, developing robust estimates for household transmission parameters will take some time. Evidence from other human coronaviruses may therefore be useful, given similar routes of transmission 1, 2 .\n"," Outbreaks of other emerging coronaviruses, i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), appear to be primarily based in health care settings without substantial community transmission and household transmission studies are limited. Estimates of transmission risk to at least one other household member following a SARS index case range from 12.3%-13.5%, with estimated secondary household attack risks between 4.6%-10.2% 3-5 . In index cases, younger age and healthcare worker status were associated with lower risk of household transmission. A single study of MERS found that 44% of households with an index case experienced onwards transmission, with a secondary attack risk of 24% and risk factors for developing secondary infection in contacts including being adult, male, and having long-term conditions 6 .\n"," Seasonal coronavirus infections also appear to cluster within households 7 , with proportions of onwards transmission to at least one household member following child index cases ranging between 8% and 33% 8, 9 . A recent community cohort study based in Michigan 10 found secondary attack risks ranging from 7.2%-12.6% for circulating seasonal coronavirus strains and clinical-onset serial intervals between 3.2-3.6 days.\n"," Here we aimed to report key characteristics of seasonal coronavirus household transmission in a population-based UK cohort, using data from the Flu Watch study 11 . We present the proportion of laboratory-confirmed seasonal coronavirus infections acquired within and outside the household, the household transmission risk and secondary attack risk for symptomatic cases, the clinical-onset serial interval, and transmission risk stratified by demographic household features.\n"," Study design and procedures Data were drawn from the Flu Watch prospective cohort study of acute respiratory infections in English households 11 . We included the three winter seasons (2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009) , during which all samples were systematically tested for coronaviruses. The Flu Watch study methodology and cohort profile are described in detail elsewhere 11,12 .\n"," Whole households were recruited annually to the study following random selection of a household member from GP practice lists. From 2008-2009, participants from the previous cohort were also re-invited to participate. Inclusion criteria were that all household members agreed to participate, and all members over 16 agreed to provide blood samples for other Flu Watch research. Exclusion criteria were household size >6 members, severely incapacitating or terminal illness in any household member, and heavy involvement in other research 12 .\n"," Participants provided demographic data at seasonal baseline following recruitment, and were followed-up weekly via telephone or online throughout each season to report any symptoms of acute respiratory infection. If participants experienced any symptoms, they were requested to provide a nasal swab on the second day of illness and to provide a daily diary of symptoms from the first day of illness until the symptoms resolved. Realtime PCR was carried out to screen nasal swabs for a panel of viruses, including three circulating seasonal coronavirus strains (229-E, NL63, and OC43) 11 .\n"," Guided by an estimated incubation period of 2-5 days and further 2-18 days of symptomatic illness with viral shedding for seasonal coronaviruses 13,14 , we defined index cases as the first PCR-confirmed infection in a household or >23-days following a prior case, co-primary cases as potential index cases of the same strain arising within ≤2 days, and secondary cases as infections with the same strain occurring >2 days and ≤23 days from exposure to the index case(s). We assumed that household transmission to any secondary cases had occurred if the strain was unknown, but criteria for transmission were otherwise met.\n"," We estimated the proportions of total PCR-confirmed coronavirus cases in the study likely acquired in the community (i.e. index, co-primary, or single-person household cases) and acquired in the household (i.e. secondary cases). The proportions were weighted to the English national structure of age and region 11 .\n"," For households in which secondary transmission was possible (i.e. excluding single-person households and episodes of co-primary infection affecting all household members), we calculated the symptomatic household transmission risk-the proportion of households that experienced at least one secondary case -and the household secondary attack risk -the proportion of total exposed participants who became secondary cases. To avoid multiple inclusions of the same episode where there were co-primary cases, transmission risk and secondary attack risk were estimated based on a randomly-selected single index case. Due to the testing protocol, it was not possible to detect asymptomatic primary or secondary cases. We calculated the clinical-onset serial interval as the time in days from onset of reported symptoms in the index case(s) to onset of reported symptoms of the secondary case(s). All co-primary or multiple secondary cases in this cohort reported symptom onset on the same day.\n"," We stratified the household symptomatic transmission risk by the following household features potentially relevant to transmission: the age structure of the household (adults between 16-64 only, older adult(s), adult(s) and children), age of index case (child <16, adult 16-64, older adult 65+) for households with children (not stratified for other household structures due to limited variation), the number of people and number of children in the household, whether the household contained current smoker(s), index of multiple deprivation, long-term health conditions in household contact(s), and the index sex, index healthcare worker status and index transmission-preventive hygiene behaviour. Index case hygiene behaviour was classified as a binary variable according to adherence to prevention guidelines 15,16 i.e. covering the mouth while coughing or sneezing, using a single-use tissue, and washing the hands habitually after coughing or sneezing and at least moderately-frequently throughout the day (>=5 times according to median split and previous literature 17 ). Due to the small number of household transmissions, we present descriptive stratified analyses only and do not describe by strain sub-groups. Where features of the index case or index-exposed dyads were investigated, we included only those households where there was a clear index case rather than co-primary cases. Any instances of missing demographic data are noted in Table 1 . 7.0 (6.0-21.0, 5.0-21.0) 7.0 (6.0-7.5, 6.0-8.0) 6.5 (6-8.75, 6.0-14.0) 7.0 (6.0-9.5, 5.0-21.0) *All strains include cases where strain was unknown (n=3); **due to unknown index strain, n=5 exposed contacts were included with no outbreak strain recorded.\n"," To estimate potential non-detection of household transmissions due to non-adherence to swabbing protocol, we measured the proportion of exposed participants who reported symptoms within one month of an index case but did not submit a nasal swab. Analyses were performed in Stata Version 15. . Due to unknown index strain, outbreak strain was unavailable for five exposed participants.\n"," The median clinical-onset serial interval was 7 days (IQR = 6-9.5 days, range 5-21 days). This median value was consistent for 229E and NL63, with some between-strain variation in range, and similar to the OC43 median serial interval of 6.5 days. There were two households for which the exact date of symptom onset of the exposed case could not be traced (only the beginning date of the week of illness), which were excluded from the serial interval calculation. Adherence to swabbing protocol during household outbreaks Among the 275 exposed household members, there were 75 distinct episodes of respiratory symptoms within 23 days of a household coronavirus index case. For 4 of these episodes (5.33%), the participant did not provide a swab at any point during their illness.\n"," The study describes a range of important characteristics of seasonal coronavirus transmission that have not previously been reported. The great majority of infections (91%) were acquired outside the household. Following a symptomatic index case within the household, onward transmission to at least one other household member occurred in 14.9% of households, with a secondary attack risk of 8.0%. Risk of onwards household transmission fell within previous estimates for seasonal coronaviruses 8,9 and were higher than the limited literature suggests for SARS 3-5 , but lower than for MERS 6 . The secondary attack risk fell within the range identified for seasonal coronavirus strains in a recent US-based longitudinal cohort study 10 and was somewhat lower than preliminary estimates of the household secondary attack risk for COVID-19 -ranging between 10.5% in USA 18 , 13.6% in Taiwan Demographic and health-related characteristics with the highest point estimates for symptomatic transmission risk overlapped with risk groups for susceptibility and/or poor outcomes in COVID-19, namely households comprising older adults, current smokers, exposed members with chronic illness, and those in deprived areas 29-31 . Although children had a higher point estimate for transmission risk, index cases were distributed relatively evenly across age groups, in contrast with a Michigan community cohort study in which children comprised the majority of index cases for most strains 10 . Good hand and respiratory hygiene by index cases may be helpful for disrupting transmission, possibly overlapping with the lack onwards transmission from healthcare workers. The findings should be interpreted with caution given relatively small numbers of positive transmissions and, related, wide confidence intervals for transmission risk estimates. We were underpowered to conduct multivariate analysis required to disentangle the interrelationships between potential demographic and health-related risk factors and this is a relevant area for further research concerning seasonal and pandemic coronaviruses.\n"," This study had a number of limitations. Data were limited to winter seasons. Only symptomatic cases were swabbed and detected. While there appeared to be good adherence to the swabbing protocol among household members exposed to an index case, five percent of those who developed symptoms following exposure failing to provide a swab so secondary transmission may be underestimated. It is possible that the nasal swabbing protocol, which was developed primarily for influenza detection, did not provide ideal sensitivity for these strains of coronavirus. We also cannot exclude that index cases in the initial weeks of the study could have acquired the case through undetected household transmission. The analyses did not account for background rate of infection in the community and consequently some apparent secondary cases may have been acquired incidentally outside of the household. All risk factor analyses were limited by a relatively small number of onward transmissions.\n"," To our knowledge, this study presents the first investigation into household transmission in seasonal coronaviruses in a population-based UK sample. In typical winter seasons with individuals freely able to continue typical activities and social contacts, household transmission appears to be lower than in COVID-19. However, this difference may reflect different levels of population immunity and behaviours rather than intrinsic differences in the transmissibility of seasonal coronaviruses and the pandemic strain. This project contains the following underlying data: -Household_CoV_acquired.csv (data required to compute the proportion of cases presumably acquired outside of the household versus and the proportion acquired from household transmission. Each row represents an anonymised PCR-confirmed seasonal coronavirus case) -Household_CoV_acquired.dta (above data file in .dta format)\n"," -Household_CoV_TransmissionRisk.csv (data required to compute the risk of symptomatic onward household transmission following a seasonal coronavirus index case, and perform stratified descriptive analyses) -Household_CoV_TransmissionRisk.csv (above data file in .dta format) -Household_CoV_SAR.csv (data required to compute the seasonal coronavirus secondary attack risk overall and by strain. Each row represents an anonymised exposed-index pair from a given outbreak) -Household_CoV_SAR.dta (above data file in .dta format)\n"," -HH Transmission Serial Interval.csv (presents available, anonymised data required to compute the median clinicalonset serial interval overall and by strain for each household outbreak) This is a well-written and timely article on household transmission of seasonal coronaviruses with implications for the current pandemic. This presents original work using a population-based cohort in England which has previously been described. This prospective cohort was contacted weekly during the winter season, which is when seasonal coronaviruses circulate. Symptomatic participants in each household kept a daily log of symptoms allowing for granular data collection. PCR and strain level characterization of coronavirus diagnoses were included which was a major strength. Household transmission risk is presented and stratified by relevant characteristics including household structure, number of children, smoking, and hygiene. The findings include description of clinical serial interval, secondary attack risk, and household transmission risk stratified by strain type. The comparison of this study's household attack rates to other coronaviruses (including SARS and MERS) is very valuable and adds to the cogwheel of data informing household transmission of COVID-19. The authors do a good job of noting caution in interpretation of results given that the risk factor section is underpowered with overlapping confidence intervals.\n"," A particularly interesting result is the increased risk of transmission among males, households with older adults, smokers, and chronic illnesses which is also seen as risk factors for severe disease in COVID-19. But looking at Table 1 , it is difficult to know if these trends are statistically significant given the overlapping confidence intervals. Additionally, for \"older adults in the household\" it is unclear whether this may simply be a proxy for more individuals in a household or for having children in the household (such as a multigenerational family). The limitation of wide confidence intervals is raised in the discussion section, but this potential relationship also appears in the abstract conclusion as a major finding. Given that there are so many caveats and need for further work in this area, I suggest removing the finding from the abstract and keep it described with all the caveats in the discussion section. The fact that there were no household transmission when the index case followed hand and respiratory hygiene protocols seems to be a really important data point and finding of the study to highlight.\n"," Please define \"deprived areas\" or IMD (indices of multiple deprivation) used in Table 1 and comments in the discussion (bottom left paragraph) in the methods section.\n"," 1.\n"," In the methods section, the inability to identify asymptomatic primary or secondary cases is raised. It would be helpful to include this limitation in the discussion section and provide any underlying literature on asymptomatic transmission of seasonal coronaviruses. This is an important piece in how such data is linked to transmission of the current pandemic strain.\n"," One of the strengths of the paper is the description of strains, but the discussion does not include any background on known differences or comments/hypotheses regarding whether strain type may play a role in household transmission risk.\n"," When discussing \"households with older adults\", does this also include children and could this simply be a proxy for more people in the household?\n"," It may be valuable to discuss possible background immunity to common hCoVs a bit more in the discussion, and its possible impact on household transmission findings. This is where there is also a big difference between the common hCoVs and SARS-CoV-2. Authors allude to this throughout, but it may benefit from some attention in the discussion section.\n"," Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?

This is important work for the public health community, grappling with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; however, one limitation of the Flu Watch study, and its conclusions and relevance for the current pandemic, are that all detected infections were symptomatic because only symptomatic participants contributed nasal swab specimens for PCR testing. I look forward to further studies that can build on this study design to innovatively capture asymptomatic seasonal respiratory virus infections to better understand the drivers behind onward transmission.\n"," Specific comments that I hope the authors can address in the next version are below.\n"," Major comments Please include further description of the weekly telephone/internet survey, including the list of symptoms that were asked about.

It spread quickly to other continents and struck Europe with a spring and summer wave, affecting several countries. The rate of transmission subsided as the summer progressed but accelerated again during the autumn season, this time in all European countries. The spread followed a west to east progression, a typical pattern for seasonal influenza 1 .\n"," The first cases in Sweden appeared late in April, and local transmission followed mainly in the major cities. In late September and early October, a nationwide outbreak started, peaking in November. From mid-May, the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control required mandatory reporting of individual cases, which later changed to hospitalized patients supplemented by laboratory notification of positive samples 2 . WHO declared the end of the pandemic on 10 August 2010. However, the mandatory reporting of the H1N1 pandemic strain continued in Sweden during the following five seasons, providing a detailed and thorough collection of epidemic data on a fine spatial resolution.\n"," The spatial component of many infectious diseases is crucial for the understanding of epidemic transmission. Recent years have seen a surge in mathematical modeling to describe the geographic transmission of infectious diseases [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Specifically, with the increasing availability of geo-tagged epidemiological data, the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza has been studied using spatially explicit models. For example, studies in the US have revealed how important human mobility patterns are for explaining influenza epidemic transmission [8] [9] [10] [11] . A previous geographic study of the pandemic spread over Sweden indicated a progression from the north to the south during 2009 12 . Morris et al. 13 investigated the relationship between the spatio-temporal spreading of seasonal influenza and demographic, geographic and climatic factors. However, their study focused on Norway and only conducted a joint analysis of the other Nordic countries on the county level.\n"," Meteorological factors associated with the rate of influenza transmission among individuals include precipitation, humidity, temperature, and sun radiation 12, [14] [15] [16] . However, uncertainties in the data remain, and meteorological drivers may play more significant roles in some geographic regions than others. The role of population size and density in cities is also known to affect the dynamics of influenza transmission and the weight of environmental factors 8, 16 . Apart from the importance of schoolchildren for influenza transmission 17 , socioeconomic factors important for influenza spread remain sparsely studied 18 .\n"," Our analysis covers Sweden on the geographical level of its 290 municipalities. Almost all the data sources are domestic and are available either on the municipality level (only the cities of Stockholm and Göteborg comprise more than one municipality) or the DeSo (demographic statistical areas) 25 level, a subdivision of the municipality level. The only exception is the weather-station based meteorological data, which we have converted from specific geographic coordinates to the municipality level. Because Sweden covers a large geographical area with significant variance in features, climate, and population, the selected indicators may vary significantly.\n"," Maps and geographical data. We Travel data. Travel patterns in the Swedish population have been recorded since the mid-1990s by interviewing representative selections of several thousand 6-84-year-old inhabitants. As part of this study, we obtained complete questionnaire data for the years 2011-2016 27 . The data contains posts on individuals' daily commuting habits with partial and whole trips and the geographic origin and target at the DeSo level. Since DeSos are subdivisions of municipalities, we converted them to the municipality level.\n"," Since this study considers the years from 2009 to 2015, we have used the 2011-2016 period to define the travel patterns for all parts of the analysis, including the years 2009 and 2010. We assume travel patterns did not change significantly between the years 2009 and 2011. Furthermore, while the sample size of the survey is adequate to calculate general statistics, it is too sparse to construct a travel network with temporal dynamics, even on a yearly level. Instead, we constructed an aggregated static network containing all feasible routes of infection. To partially compensate for the survey's inadequacies, we made sure that the travel network represents all air and rail travel routes and connects all neighboring municipalities.\n"," In order to include a variable representing travel frequency between the municipalities, we implemented the radiation model of Simini et al. 28 . This model uses the population size of areas and the distance between them to estimate the population movement between these areas. Epidemiological data. Our data set consists of all laboratory-verified cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 between May 2009 and December 2015, extracted from the SmiNet register of notifiable diseases, held by the Public Health Agency of Sweden. While the number of flu cases is regularly under-reported, the SmiNet database contains 16000 records, a reasonably large sample compared to other notifiable diseases. Due to confidentiality reasons, cases are anonymized, and addresses are aggregated at the DeSo level together with the date of diagnosis, age, and gender. To make sure the addresses represent the habitation at the time of diagnosis, Statistics Sweden (SCB) cross-referenced the register with a historical address register before anonymization. We obtained ethical approval for the data acquisition.\n"," Consequently, the epidemiological data contains the number of daily reported cases at the DeSo level, which we converted to the municipality level. Socioeconomic data. One of our main goals is to establish a relationship between socioeconomic factors and epidemic spreading. Since this study only considers Sweden, high-quality data is readily available from Sta- Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of indicators 1, 2, 3 and the population sizes of the municipalities of Sweden. Both population density and population size have been used before to model epidemic spreading 16 . In a geographical setting, population density is preferred due to its independence from inequalities in the size of geographical areas. In contrast, using population size can be misleading if differences are more than minimal. However, the fine geographical resolution of the municipalities of Sweden and the lack of huge population centers (except Stockholm and Göteborg) allow us to use population size as a variable. We experimented with both density and size in our study. We found that density only has a small contribution to the timing of the epidemic events, while population size is a significant factor. Therefore, we chose to include population size.\n"," Meteorological data. Even though the exact mechanisms are unknown, the relationship between environmental temperature and humidity and seasonal influenza is well established in the literature [14] [15] [16] 30 . As such, it is one of the key factors used in this study. Due to Sweden's geographical position and the Gulf Stream effect, the country's climate ranges from an oceanic climate in the far south to a subarctic climate in the far north, while central Sweden has a humid continental climate.\n"," We obtained detailed meteorological data from the European Climate Assessment Dataset 31 . This database contains daily meteorological station observations covering Europe. Of the elements available in the database, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ we included mean temperature and relative humidity converted to absolute humidity as factors in this study. We show the averaged mean temperatures and absolute humidity of a few select municipalities on Fig. 1C ,D.\n"," The GIIM method uses a network to represent the geographical areas involved in the outbreak. The nodes of the network are the geographical areas themselves, while the links represent possible routes of infection. In the GIIM model, attributes (or weights) can be assigned to both the nodes and the edges of the network; these are important parts of the model and usually represent factors or determinants potentially related to disease spreading. The last and most important input of the model is a set of reference observations from an actual outbreak, which take the form of a time series of values on the same geographical resolution as the nodes of the network. The goal of GIIM is to identify the transmission risks on the links of the network defined as a function of known attributes, and return the parameters of this function. The parameters are estimated with an iterative refinement approach. Starting from an initially random set of parameters, the method constructs a simulated outbreak and calculates a set of observations. These simulated observations are then compared to the reference observations and an error value is computed. Depending on the size of the error, the method either stops and returns set of edge infection probabilities, or it updates the set of parameters using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. In latter case, the process is repeated until the error between the simulated and reference observations is minimal. Fig. 3 shows a flowchart of the method.\n"," The GIIM method has been successfully applied to real-world problems 32 , including the modeling of the geographical spread and transmission of Zika in the Americas 23 . GIIM brings a novel approach to epidemic modeling because instead of merely simulating an outbreak, the method estimates an infection process's parameters and properties using observations from an actual outbreak. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Inputs. The GIIM method requires three inputs: an underlying network structure, attributes assigned to the nodes and edges of the network, and a set of observations on a real-life transmission process. The underlying network structure in this study represents the municipalities of Sweden. We denote graph G as G(V, E), where V G is a set containing all the vertices of the graph, while E G contains all the edges of the graph. We denote the edges of G as e uv ∈ E G with u as the origin and v as the destination of the edge, where u and v are nodes of the network and edge e uv links node u to v. The nodes of the network represent the 290 municipalities of Sweden, and we define the edges of the network based on the travel survey introduced in the data section. We created a directed edge between two municipalities A and B if at least one individual traveled from A to B. To ensure that we represented all feasible travel paths in the network, we connected all neighboring municipalities. In this way, the edges indicate significant recorded travel between the pair of municipalities they connect. We denote this network G S and illustrate it in Fig. 1A .\n"," Attributes. We represent the previously defined socioeconomic, travel, and meteorological factors as attributes assigned to the edges. All attributes are real values normalized between zero and one. The following attributes are assigned to each edge e uv :\n"," 1. F uv the estimated amount of travel between municipalities u and v according to the radiation model. Attribute function. To reconstruct the observed outbreak using the network and its attributes, GIIM repeatedly runs a simulated infection process. The infection process requires transmission probabilities (also called edge infection probabilities) w t uv ∈ [0, 1], e uv ∈ E G S assigned to the edges of the network. The flexibility of the GIIM model allows us to define these values as a function of known attributes. In this paper, we define the functions with the attributes listed above.\n"," The variables in Eq. (1) cover the attributes listed previously, while A denotes a constant. The optimization algorithm of GIIM estimates the coefficients of these functions. Note, that some of the attributes received a zero or close to zero weight during the optimization process. We left out these attributes from the final model. See the results section for a discussion of the final set of attributes and their coefficients.\n"," Reference outbreak. The GIIM method seeks to estimate the parameters of an actual outbreak. Information about this outbreak comes in the form of reference observations. While observations can take different forms 20 , here we define the reference observations as a set of binary column vectors, where each row corresponds to a municipality, i.e. a node in the network, while each vector represents a given time period. The goal in this paper is to estimate the timing of the epidemic onset, therefore each value in these binary vectors indicates if the onset has already happened in the corresponding municipality in the corresponding time period. A value of 1 indicates that the epidemic onset already happened, while a 0 indicates that it has not happened yet. The week of the onset has a value of 1. We identified the week in which the epidemic onset happened in each municipality manually, by marking the week when the number of confirmed cases doubled compared to the previous week.\n"," An example of a set of reference observations can be seen as follows.\n"," Each row corresponds to a municipality, t indicates a time period and there are t e time periods in total. The epidemic onset happened at t = 2 in municipality 2 and 3 and sometime later in municipality 1. Municipality 4 avoided the outbreak.\n"," We model the spreading of influenza on a weekly basis, therefore each time period (and each binary vector) references a specific epidemic week. However, the timing of the epidemic seasons varies depending on the year. Table 1 lists the weeks in each season when there was a significant number of flu cases. We used these weeks to In this study, we adopt the SI compartmental infection model defined for networks 20, 37 , which was successfully used to model the first occurrence of Zika 23 and the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic 24 . Part of the more general SEIR infection model family, the SI model only has two states: susceptible (S) and infected (I), representing infectious nodes, which continuously try to infect their healthy neighbors, and susceptible nodes prone to infection. Each node of the network has a state during the process, which may change over time. We assign edge infection probabilities w t uv ∈ [0, 1] to all edges of the network. The t time index indicates that these probabilities may change their values depending on the discrete time scale of the process. However, w t uv is strictly an input of the model and does not depend on the spreading process in any way. The infection process is iterative and takes place in a finite number of discrete time steps. In each iteration, a node may change its state depending on the state of its neighbors and the edge infection probabilities assigned to the edges connecting it to them. Nodes may change their states from susceptible to infected, but infected nodes stay infected until the end of the process. The total number of discrete time steps the process takes is limited to the number of weeks with reported new flu cases.\n"," As in Ref. 20, 23 , we define the SI infection model using a graph G(V, E) with edge infection probabilities w t uv assigned to all of its edges and the initial set of infected nodes A 0 . The rest of the nodes are in the susceptible state at the beginning of the process. Let A t ⊆ V G be the set of infected nodes in iteration t. In each iteration t each infected node u ∈ A t tries to infect all its susceptible neighbors v ∈ V G \\ A t depending on the edge infection probability w t uv of the edge connecting them. If the attempt is successful, v joins the set of infected nodes in the following iteration. If more than one node is trying to infect v in the same iteration, the attempts are made independently of each other in an arbitrary order within the same iteration. The process terminates naturally if all nodes reachable from the initially infected nodes with nonzero edge infection probabilities adopt the infected state, or when there are no more reported new flu cases.\n"," The above process defines a single instance of an outbreak. Instead of binary values, GIIM requires for each node the likelihood of being in an infectious state for all time steps. To estimate the likelihood of infection for each node at each time step, we run the SI model k times and compute for each time step the fraction of instances where the nodes were infected. This approach is similar to the ones used in 38, 39 . Following the observations in 39 and our previous experiences in 23 , we set k = 5000 . This setting provides good accuracy while reducing the overall runtime of the simulations. When we refer to the infection model's output, we refer to the estimated likelihood values as opposed to the binary outputs of a single instance.\n"," The GIIM method. The GIIM method 20 defines the problem of estimating edge infection probabilities as an optimization task. Its inputs include a network, several attributes on the nodes and the edges of the network, and a set of reference observations of an actual outbreak. GIIM provides an estimation of the observed outbreak by simulating one. Apart from the result of the simulation (which may be more detailed than the original), its output provides an assignment of edge infection probabilities and the relative importance of the attributes according to Eq. (1).\n"," To define GIIM's inputs, let o t denote a vector containing observations on an infection process. Let o t assign a value to all v ∈ V G . Let t ∈ T denote a discrete time stamp indicating the week in which the observation was taken, and T be the set of all time stamps. Let O denote the set of all observations � o t ∈ O for all t ∈ T . Let I denote the SI infection model introduced in the previous subsection, and W G : E G � → [0, 1] be the initially unknown assignment of edge weights to the edges of the graph. Finally, let Inf be a procedure, which makes www.nature.com/scientificreports/ observations on infection process I at sample times T, taking place on graph G with assigned edge weights w uv ∈ W, e uv ∈ E(G) . We denote Inf as O = Inf (G, W, I , T for all t ∈ T , calculating the AUC value for each pair and averaging over all pairs. The GIIM method uses an iterative refinement algorithm to solve the optimization task above. Starting from an initially random edge weight assignment, GIIM simulates an outbreak and compares the output with reference observations. Then it updates the edge weight assignments and repeats the process. The search algorithm uses the Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization method 21 , a multi-agent iterative optimization algorithm, which was previously shown to perform well with GIIM 20,23 . Algorithm 1 and Fig. 3 summarizes the GIIM algorithm.\n"," Estimating individual edges is difficult due to the size of most networks. To avoid this problem, GIIM defines the edge weights as a function of known attributes on the nodes or edges. This way, the goal of the optimization task is to find the coefficients of this function. GIIM also makes it possible to define dynamic attributes or edge weights, indicating that their value changes in time. In practice, this means that the edge weight or attribute is a function of t, a discrete time stamp corresponding to the actual iteration of the infection model.\n"," The general form of the edge function can b e written as w t uv = g(f 1 (a t 1 (e uv ), � c 1 ), f 2 (a t 2 (e uv ), c 2 ), . . . , f ℓ (a t ℓ (e uv ), c ℓ ), c g ) for all e uv ∈ E G A , where a t i (e uv ) represents the i-th attribute on edge e uv ∈ E G at iteration t of the infection process, ℓ denotes the number of available attributes, f 1 , . . . , f ℓ and g are functions and c 1 , . . . , c ℓ , c g are coefficients of functions f 1 , . . . , f ℓ , g . This formulation is easy to implement and allows us to assign different functions to different attributes, while the role of function g is to aggregate and normalize the results of the individual attribute functions to ensure they fall between 0 and 1. The value w t uv denotes the edge weights and C the set of all coefficient vectors. Using the function-based alternative greatly simplifies the optimization task, reducing the number of values we have to estimate from |W| = |E G | to |C|. However, its main advantage is that instead of providing a single individual value for each edge, it allows us to explore the relationship between the factors potentially related to the outbreak and the outbreak itself.\n"," Equation (1) defines the edge functions used in this study. We trim the weighted sums above 1 and below 0 by\n"," . To reduce the solution space of the PSO method and to make the results of individual test runs comparable, we bound all parameters between −0.5 and 0.5, except A, which we bound between −1 and 1.\n"," Ethics approval and consent to participate. All data were anonymized to be not retraceable to individuals by the Public Health Agency of Sweden before being accessed by the research team. Approval was granted by the Regional Ethical Committee in Umeå on 2015-10-20.\n"," We start our analysis by studying the spreading of H1N1 in the autumn of 2009 between weeks 37 and 50, corresponding to a period from mid-September to mid-December. We model the outbreak on a weekly basis and set up the input files of GIIM as described in the Inputs section. To partially account for the summer wave of infections in 2009, we select the municipalities of Stockholm, Malmo and Gothenburg as infected in the starting week of the analysis because these municipalities contained the most infected individuals during the summer wave. We use the attribute function defined in Eq. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ tions and functions. While we started our analysis with the function shown in Eq. (1), several of our input attributes received a coefficient close to zero. These were travel frequency ( F uv ), household income ( I v ) and social aid ( S v ). We excluded these variables from the final model in Eq. (2) . Figure 4 shows the mean of the coefficients assigned to the remaining risk factors, while Table 2 shows the mean, the minimum, the maximum and the standard deviation of these factors.\n"," The weights in Eq. (2) represent each risk factor's relative contribution to the transmission risk between the municipalities. The standard deviation of the coefficients across test runs is small except for absolute humidity. More importantly, the relative importance of the risk factors remains robust.\n"," The most significant factor in the timing of the epidemic onset is the population size of the municipalities, indicating that the disease reaches large population centers first and then spreads to the countryside. This result is in line with observations in the US and UK, where both population size and the more commonly used population density were already established as important contributors to this phenomenon 8 . Our results indicate that the importance of large population centers is far greater than identified in 13 , possibly because of the higher spatial resolution of our model in Sweden.\n"," Another significant risk factor is the incidence of H1N1 cases in the municipalities on the origin of the links. This coefficient is closely tied to the network-based structure of our model, which is similar to agentbased approaches 6, 7 and underlines the spatial structure of the spreading process, which we discuss in the next subsection.\n"," The contribution of the amount of travel between municipalities was close to zero in our initial model, thus the parameter was omitted from Eq. (2). This result is in line with the observations in 13 . The exact role of this indicator is debated in the literature. Some studies identify it as a minor factor 5,16,23 , while others emphasize its effect in local or global transmission 7, 8 . One possible explanation for its lack of importance here, is that our study only considers a relatively small geographical area, a single country having a well developed transportation infrastructure. Our results are also in line with the conclusions in 12, 23 , which states that the presence of a few infected travelers is enough to spread the disease to different regions.\n"," Meteorological factors such as temperature and humidity are known to play a critical role in the appearance of influenza 12, 16 . According to our model, a decrease in absolute humidity is one of the main driving factors in H1N1 spreading, while a drop in temperature provides a smaller contribution. This result confirms the findings of Skog et al. 12 , but contradicts the findings of Morris et al. 13 , which identified no such relationship. We provide www.nature.com/scientificreports/ two explanations for this: First, our model offers a much higher spatial resolution for Sweden than the model in 13 . Second, the high-resolution results of Morris et al. apply to Norway, which has a different climate closer to the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Current with the Scandinavian Mountains separating the two countries. Perhaps due to the relative homogeneity of a single country, we found that the effect of the socioeconomic variables on the transmission risk between municipalities to be minimal. The average number of school-age children per household, which is a well-known risk factor 17 , showed the most significant influence. The influence of both income and social aid is close to zero in our model. However, median income and social aid at the municipality level might not be sufficiently sensitive indicators to measure the inequalities in Swedish society.\n"," We conclude that the three variables that influence the timing of the epidemic onset the most are population size, the number of cases in neighboring municipalities and a decrease in the absolute humidity of the environment. This result is in line with the spreading mechanism of agent-based simulations where the outbreak travels from region to region after infecting a certain amount of people locally, favoring population centers 6, 7 . Temperature also has a small negative effect, while school-aged children have a small positive effect. Exportation, importation and route level risk. The edge infection or transmission probabilities between the municipalities of Sweden are among the outputs of GIIM. It is possible to define a node-based import and export risk weight by aggregating the edge-based risk values on the in-and out-edges of each node. This value is also known as node strength. These values are not probabilities but risk indicators of importing or exporting the disease from or to a municipality. They represent a relative weight that allows us to rank the municipalities. Figure 5 shows exportation, importation and route level risk for a few select municipalities, while Fig. 5A shows their location in Sweden. Figure 5B illustrates the time-dependent exportation risk values for some of the highest risk municipalities in onset estimation. Large population centers appear at the top of the list. While Göteborg and Stockholm remain at the top, Malmö only stays in the top 20 exporters during the initial weeks, with its relevance decreasing even more later in the outbreak. Other larger cities include Linköping, Jönköping and Uppsala, although their relevance fades in time except for Uppsala. Several of the larger cities of northern Sweden, such as Skellefteå, Umeå, and Gävle, are top exporters until mid-November, partially confirming the observations in 12 . Figure 5C illustrates the time-dependent importation risk values for some high-risk municipalities in onset estimation. This ranking is more static than the export ranking, with large population centers remaining high risk until the end of the outbreak. These cities include Linköping, Jönköping, Norrköping, Uppsala, Örebro and Västerås, together with a few northern municipalities such as Umeå, Gävle and Sundsvall. In contrast to the export risk ranking, Stockholm county and Västra Götaland are not top-import municipalities. However, our model only considers domestic travel patterns in Sweden, therefore the risk of importation from international travellers is not included in our analysis. This fact may explain the seemingly low risk of importation in Stockholm.\n"," Due to a large number of edges in the graph, it is difficult to highlight the individual links most important to the outbreak. Figure 5D shows some of these links. For example, early in the outbreak, links connecting to Uppsala appear most prominently among links to Umeå, Linköping, Örebro and Västerås. This pattern remains until the end of the outbreak. Starting from mid-October, links connecting the municipalities of Northern Sweden appear at the top of the edge-based risk ranking and stay there for several weeks until mid-November. At the end of our observation period, links connecting larger population centers in South and Central Sweden dominate the top of the ranking.\n"," Our observations on the timing of the epidemic onset of H1N1 in the fall of 2009 follow a loose geographical pattern. Following the smaller summer wave of infections, the disease stays in the largest cities. From September, it begins slowly spreading to the other larger population centers of South and Central Sweden and a few cities in Northern Sweden. A massive burst of the outbreak happens in mid-October, reaching the countryside in South and Central Sweden and moving north along the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, infecting the larger population centers on its way. After peaking in most of the country in early and mid-November, the outbreak first ends in the north and finally in the largest cities where it began.\n"," Model accuracy. We evaluated the accuracy of our model by independently computing the ROC AUC value for each week of the estimation process. The averaged AUC value for all 14 weeks of the observation period was 0.875, indicating a good fit. Figure 6 shows individual AUC values for all weeks. The estimation is easy during the first weeks due to the small number of positive examples. In most municipalities, the fall H1N1 outbreak started and peaked in weeks 42-45. In these weeks, the accuracy of the estimation process drops to around 0.82, indicating some uncertainty in the exact timing of the onset, stabilizing around 0.85 in the second half of the observation period.\n"," Model predictability. To demonstrate the robustness of our approach, we use the attribute function with estimated coefficients from the 2009 outbreak in conjunction with the infection model to predict the timing of the epidemic onset in the influenza outbreaks in epidemic seasons 10/11, 12/13, 13/14, 14/15. We omitted season 11/12 from our analysis due to the small number of H1N1 cases in that season. We updated our dynamic input attributes to match the actual temperature and humidity values in the periods. We also defined the infection sources for each of the target seasons and estimation types by selecting the three municipalities with the earliest appearance of the disease.\n"," To test the accuracy of our predictions, we set up the reference observations for our four target seasons in the same way as for the 09/10 season (for observation periods of these seasons, see Table 1 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ infection model for each season, we compared their output with the corresponding reference observations by computing the ROC AUC metric. As shown in Fig. 7 , the average AUC values for all successive seasons stay close or even exceed the accuracy we have seen in the 2009 pandemic. The individual AUC values present a similar picture, although the trends inside epidemic seasons differ somewhat from those in Fig. 6 , with accuracy slowly decreasing as the outbreak progresses but stabilizing well above 0.8. The predictive accuracy is higher in the 13/14 and 14/15 seasons than in the first two. While the weakening immunity granted to the population by the 09/10 pandemic may explain this trend, our results do not provide conclusive evidence to confirm this hypothesis.\n"," According to our findings, the spreading of H1N1 in Sweden was mainly driven by large population centers, the presence and size of outbreaks in neighboring municipalities and the meteorological factors humidity and temperature. Confirming observations in 13, 23 , the amount of travelers is not an important factor. This result may be due to the relatively small geographical scope of the study and the well-developed infrastructure of the country. Supporting existing results on the effect of meteorological factors in influenza spreading 12, 16 , absolute humidity plays a critical role in our model, while mean temperature contributes less. The only other socioeconomic indicator that contributes noticeably to our model is the number of children per household, confirming the observations in 17 . The effect of the rest of the socioeconomic factors, income and social aid, is close to zero. However, the spatial resolution of our model might be too low to identify their contribution. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Compared to other studies discussing the role of socioeconomic, climate and travel indicators in influenza spreading in the Nordic countries, we confirm most of the observations of Skog et al. 12 and some of Morris et al. 13 . Due to the radically different methodology used in these studies, a more direct comparison is not within the scope of this paper. We also extended these previous works by examining the effect of a larger set of indicators and providing an analysis of the most critical travel routes involved in the spreading of influenza.\n"," While our model is constructed based on the 2009 pandemic, we can make accurate predictions on the timing of the selected epidemic events in the following seasons. Therefore, our model can be used as a realtime decision support tool advising on resource allocation and surveillance. Furthermore, while our study only considers H1N1 spreading, it can be adapted to model other influenza strains or respiratory infections with a similar transmission mechanism.\n"," The input and output data used in this paper can be found at http:// snd. gu. se/ en/ catal ogue/ study/ 2021-282\n"," The implementation of the proposed algorithm is available on request from the authors. \n","Score: 6.911212529191076\n","\n","Title: Can long-term historical data from electronic medical records improve surveillance for epidemics of acute respiratory infections? A systematic evaluation\n","Body Text: We simulated surveillance systems aimed at discovering modeled influenza outbreaks injected into backgrounds of patients with ARI. Backgrounds of daily case counts were either synthesized or obtained by applying one of three previously validated ARI case-detection algorithms to authentic EMR entries. From the time of outbreak injection, detection statistics were applied daily on paired background+injection and background-only time series. The relationship between the detection delay (the time from injection to the first alarm uniquely found in the background+injection data) and the false-alarm rate (FAR) was determined by systematically varying the statistical alarm threshold. We compared this relationship for outbreak detection methods that utilized either 7 days (early aberrancy reporting system (EARS)) or 2-4 years of past data (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time series modeling).\n"," In otherwise identical surveillance systems, SARIMA detected epidemics sooner than EARS at any FAR below 10%. The algorithms used to detect single ARI cases impacted both the feasibility and marginal benefits of SARIMA modeling. Under plausible real-world PLOS \n"," Outbreaks due to novel strains of influenza [1] [2] [3] or coronavirus [4, 5] illustrate why we must remain vigilant toward epidemics of acute respiratory infections (ARI). ARI epidemics need be recognized as soon as possible if prevention and mitigation measures are to be effective [6, 7] . The electronic medical record (EMR) includes numerous entries (e.g. clinical notes, vital signs, diagnostic codes, test results) that could combine to facilitate the discovery of individual cases [8, 9] or outbreaks of ARI [10] . In integrated health delivery systems, EMR data originate across the continuum of care, from ambulatory visits to intensive care units. A monitoring system rooted in such a comprehensive EMR implementation could provide early insight into outbreak severity and support the flow of information necessary to manage specific patients as well as the overall epidemic [11] [12] [13] .\n"," With the EMR fast becoming commonplace [14] , long-term EMR-derived datasets will soon be routinely available. In this context, we asked if statistical methods that consider longterm EMR data patterns could benefit ARI epidemic detection. Because most ARI result from viral diseases that exhibit marked seasonality, we hypothesized that fitting multi-year timeseries of daily ARI case counts with seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SAR-IMA) models [15, 16] could accelerate epidemic detection, compared to methods that base their forecasting on the recent past only [17] . To begin to test this hypothesis, we used software to recreate surveillance systems operating prospectively on synthetic or authentic historical datasets. Our results suggest that, under realistic surveillance conditions, SARIMA could help shorten outbreak detection delay.\n"," The Institutional Review Boards of the Veterans Administration (VA) Maryland Health Care System and the University of Maryland approved this study. The study was granted a waiver of consent, as risks were limited to information confidentiality, because the research-related risks were minimal and did not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants, and because the work would not have otherwise been feasible, given the large number of participants. All EMR information was de-identified prior to simulations and analyses, which used only daily case counts. s17 and the s33 time series, which mimic typical surveillance data for ARI such as pneumonia, influenza or influenza-like illness, with lower counts on weekend and holidays, long-term increase in counts and seasonality [18] . The synthetic outbreaks \"08\" (Log Normal) or the \"04\" (Inverted Log Normal) served as the epidemic signal to be injected. Characteristics of the synthetic backgrounds are summarized in Table 1 . The datasets are provided as supplementary material (S1 File).\n"," Authentic backgrounds. EMR entries were extracted from Veterans Integrated Service Technology Architecture hierarchical databases (MDE v.6.1.0.0, Strategic Reporting Systems, Inc. Peabody MA) and transferred to relational databases (SQL Server 2008, Microsoft Corp, Redmond CA). We used case detection algorithms (CDA) previously developed against a manual record review seeking reference ARI cases, defined as: [Positive influenza culture/antigen OR Any two of the following, of no more than 7 days duration: cough; fever or chills or night sweats; pleuritic chest pain; myalgia; sore throat; headache] AND Illness not attributable to a non-infectious etiology [8] . We chose the following ARI CDAs: a) CDA1 (sensitivity 63%, positive predictive value (PPV) 13%) retrieved outpatient visits where provider assigned a diagnostic code (International Classification of Diseases, 9 th version) included in an ARIrelated set used by a surveillance system of national scope [19] ; b) CDA2 (sensitivity 69%, PPV 54%) retrieved outpatient visits assigned a diagnostic code that belonged to a grouping modified for increased performance at the VA [8] ), and where automated text analysis of the visitrelated clinical note(s) identified at least two symptoms from the above ARI case definition [8, 20] . CDA2 was chosen because its use resulted in the highest epidemic detection performance amongst eight (8) alternative ARI case-detection methods [10] , illustrating the gains in system performance that could be achieved by combining different EMR data fields compared to using diagnostic codes alone; c) CDA3 retrieved CDA2 patients subset with a core body temperature of more than 37.8˚C measured on the day of their index visit (sensitivity 71%, PPV 68%). Our rationale for choosing CDA3 was that while its high performance could translate into timely epidemic detection, low daily case counts could represent a challenging substrate for time series modeling. To generate CDA-specific time series of daily case counts, each ARI CDA was applied to a relational database containing EMR documentation of outpatient clinical encounters [8] over a 7-year period, from January 1999 to December 2005. These time series formed the basis for the authentic \"backgrounds\" used for the whole-system simulations (see Fig 1A ( insert), Table 1 , and S1 File). EMR data included in CDA 1-3 have been extracted daily at the VAMHCS. Thus, any of the CDA tested could be incorporated in a prospective surveillance system.\n"," We developed an epidemic model of influenza to supply a plausible outbreak signal with which we could compare alternative surveillance system constructs [10] . The model includes coupled series of differential equations [21] adjusted to describe an epidemic of severe, 1918-like influenza, propagating through a susceptible population with the size, age structure, and age-specific birth and death rates described for Baltimore, MD [10] . The proportion of community cases presenting to the VA Maryland Health Care System was adjusted to reflect the age, gender, and population estimates of Baltimore veterans, over half of whom are older than 60 years old and more than 90% are male [22] . The model, its settings and documentation are provided as S2 File). Prior to injection, the modeled epidemic case counts were first discounted by the known sensitivity of the ARI CDA used to generate the background cases [8] . Fig 1A shows an example of the modeled influenza outbreak injected into an authentic background.\n"," Simulations of surveillance systems. We wrote software to simulate prospective surveillance systems operating on the authentic historical background datasets described above (R v. 2.10.1, http://www.r-project.org). The software began a surveillance cycle on the day when the modeled epidemic signal was injected into a background time series. Starting on the injection day, and then daily for a total of 80 days, a statistical outbreak detection method (see below) was applied in parallel to the background+epidemic (Combined) time series, and to the \"Background-only\" time series. The value of the statistic for each day was stored for subsequent analysis. The 80-day surveillance cycle was repeated, each time shifting the outbreak injection to a different week of the two, one-year study periods (from August 1 st 2002 to July 31 st 2003, and from August 1 st 2003 to July 31 st 2004). In a final phase, the software applied a family of threshold values beyond which the computed daily statistics would constitute an \"alarm\". On a given day and for a given threshold, an alarm that originated in the Background-only time series was considered a \"false alarm\". An alarm present in the Combined dataset but absent from the Background-only dataset was considered a \"true alarm\" (Fig 1B and 1C) . For a given alarm threshold, the software computed two benchmarks: 1) the \"Detection Delay\", the time from outbreak injection to the first true alarm, averaged for the 52 weekly surveillance cycles for a given one-year study period; 2) the daily false alarm rate (FAR), defined as the number of unique false alarms during the evaluation year, divided by 365 days. Corresponding pairs of Detection Delay and FAR were computed over broad ranges of alarm thresholds and used to plot CDA-specific activity monitoring operating characteristic (AMOC) curves [23] .\n"," Outbreak detection statistics. We compared two statistical approaches to detect the addition of the modeled epidemic signal to the backgrounds: 1) the early aberration reporting system (EARS) W2c [24] , which made predictions using data from the past 7 days of the relevant time series; and 2) seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models [25] , which used 2-4 years of past data.\n"," EARS. Daily case counts were first separated into two time series, one for weekdays and another for weekends/federal holidays. For a given day, the W2c statistic is expressed as\n"," where t is the time series index, Y(t) is the observed case count on that index day, \" Y ðtÞ and S(t) are a 7-day moving sample mean and standard deviation calculated with a 2-day lag from the index day. The value of S(t) was replaced by 1 if S(t) < 1.\n"," SARIMA. We used the Box-Jenkins method [15, 26] to develop separate SARIMA models (SAS v. 9.1, SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC) for the weekdays and weekends background time series corresponding to the s17 and s33 datasets (January 1 st 1994 to December 31 st 1997) or retrieved via each of the three ARI CDAs (from January 2, 1999 to August 13, 2002) . Models were of the form \"SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s\", which abbreviates the following equation:\n"," where B is the backshift operator; y t is the observation at time t; ε t is a sequence of \n"," is a moving average polynomial of order q for the non-seasonal component; F Ã P ðBÞ ¼ ð1 À 0 Ã 1 B s À 0 Ã 2 B 2s À Á Á Á À 0 Ã p B Ps Þ is an autoregressive polynomial of order P for the seasonal component; D is the order of the seasonal differencing; and Y Ã Q ðBÞ ¼ ð1 À y Ã 1 B s À y Ã 2 B 2s À Á Á Á À y Ã Q B Qs Þ is a moving average polynomial of order Q for the seasonal component. The cyclic periods were taken as 364 days [27] , 260 days and 104 days for years, weekdays and weekends, respectively. Before model-fitting, times series were modified as follows: 1) occasional high counts (n = 2-4 per year) and low counts for federal holidays were replaced by the average of the past three daily counts from the relevant time series; 2) a square root transformation was applied to make the data series stationary in both mean and variance, and thus satisfy model assumptions [16, 26] .\n"," Putative models were explored interactively to search for the most appropriate SARIMA form for each time series. The models coefficients were then estimated and their statistical significance evaluated. Some coefficients of the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) at lags of 260 and multiples of 260 were statistically significant, confirming that seasonal model components should be included. Overall model adequacy was assessed by comparing model-generated counts to the actual counts used for model building. SARIMA models were finally retained for surveillance implementation when they best fulfilled the following criteria: 1) minimum Akaike's Information Criterion value; 2) minimum mean absolute deviation of errors; 3) minimum root mean square root error; 4) normality of residuals; 5) parsimony. Each of the sixteen SARIMA models was used daily to forecast the next day's case count in their respective times series during the study periods. With each passing day, the models updated themselves to incorporate the latest information into the forecasting procedure.\n"," The final SARIMA models for weekday ARI counts were of the form SARIMA (1,0,1) (0,1,1) 260 for CDA1 and CDA2, but were of a different form for the synthetic backgrounds i.e. SARIMA (0,1,1)(1,0,1) 260 and SARIMA (1,0,1) (1,0,1) 260 for the s17 and the s33 time series, respectively. Models for the weekend ARI counts were all of the form SARIMA (1,0,1) (0,1,1) 104 . Case counts retrieved by CDA3 were low, and did not allow SARIMA modeling.\n"," In an initial set of simulations, we utilized either the EARS or the SARIMA outbreak detection methods on synthetic time series that exhibited seasonal increases in case counts typical of ARI. As expected, lowering the statistical alarm threshold decreased the time it took to discover the injected outbreak but increased the false-alarm rate (FAR). As the AMOC curves shown in Fig 2 illustrate , the relationship between the detection delay and the FAR was not linear, with a change around a low FAR producing a greater change in outbreak detection delay than a similar change around a high FAR.\n"," The SARIMA method discovered the injected outbreaks faster than EARS did, at any FAR below 10% (compare EARS (open black symbols) to SARIMA (closed red symbols) for the s17 (Fig 2A) or the s33 backgrounds (Fig 2B) ). The timeliness advantage of SARIMA over EARS became increasingly pronounced at FARs below 2%, where real-world surveillance systems would be expected to operate.\n"," To determine if the performance gains observed with SARIMA in all-synthetic contexts would translate into meaningful real-world benefits, we modified the simulations in two ways: 1) we ran previously validated ARI CDAs on a repository of our own EMR data to generate authentic historical time series of ARI cases [8] ; 2) we modeled an epidemic of severe influenza centered in Baltimore to create an ARI outbreak that could plausibly be experienced by our health system. To gain insight into year-to-year variation in system performance, we performed surveillance simulations over two different one-year time periods: a) 8/2002-7/2003, a year with an average ARI incidence; and b) 8/2003-7/2004, a year with a high seasonal incidence of ARIs. In keeping with prior observations [10] , EARS-based surveillance exhibited a better performance when using CDA2 for ARI case detection than when using CDA1, with consistently shorter outbreak detection delay at any FAR for both study periods (in Fig 3, Fig 3A (2002-03) and Fig 3B (2003-04) ; for CDA2, compare open black to closed red squares in Fig 3C (2002-03) and Fig 3D  (2003-04) ). Gains in timeliness due to SARIMA were highest at low FAR and were larger for CDA1 than for CDA2 (in Fig 3, compare the distance between the black and red tracings in panels A and B to that in panels C and D). Examination of the AMOC curves in Fig 3 suggests that at the commonly used daily FAR of 1%, SARIMA could reduce detection delay by~14-16 days for CDA1, and by~5 days for CDA2.\n"," To gain further insight into the practical usefulness of incorporating long-term historical data for ARI surveillance, we extended the CDA2-based surveillance system forward in time to include the summer of 2009, when the first wave of a pandemic of a novel H1N1 influenza strain (pH1N1) reached the US [2] . We avoided the time period immediately following the public announcement of the pandemic, as this period contained many visits from worried individuals but only sporadic laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases. Our comparison period thus began on May 24 and ended August 22, before the very large second wave of the epidemic reached Baltimore. During this period, there were peaks in laboratory-based surveillance for pH1N1 in Baltimore, MD, but no corresponding local peak of ARI visits observed in CDC's BioSense syndromic surveillance system.\n"," During the summer 2009 comparison period, SARIMA identified more true-positive alarms than EARS at any FAR below 10% (Fig 4A) . The example shown in Fig 4B highlights additional true positive alarms uncovered by SARIMA that were missed by EARS (red dots). Time-series modeling for ARI surveillance Within this FAR range, both EARS and SARIMA identified the first true positive alarm, a large peak of ARI cases occurring 10 days into the comparison period. Thus, for this particular outbreak signal, the more sensitive SARIMA method offered no timeliness advantage over EARS.\n"," In this work, we found that modeling long-term trends and seasonality in disease incidence with SARIMA can improve the performance of EMR-based influenza surveillance compared to EARS, a method that considers the recent past only. The algorithms used to detect single ARI cases impacted both the feasibility of SARIMA modeling and the magnitude of the SAR-IMA-related gains in detection timeliness. Under plausible conditions for our local health system, SARIMA could speed up epidemic detection by several days, a meaningful improvement considering how rapidly influenza can spread through a community [28] .\n"," If the need for a software framework to assess surveillance systems has previously been recognized [29] , we could find no published precedent for a modular test bed where both caseand outbreak-detection methods can be interchanged. Because adjustments in statistical alarm thresholds are method-specific and their effect on FAR unpredictable, we used simulations to determine the relationship between FAR and detection delay empirically. A graphical representation of this relationship intuitively informed a performance trade-off of key concern to public health practitioners.\n"," Many statistical aberrancy detection methods have been described for epidemic surveillance [17, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , including time series modeling [31, 35, 36] . Some of these methods have been applied to the same data sets and formally compared [18, [37] [38] [39] [40] . Of the two studies that addressed the value of historical data, a generalized linear model (GLM) that took advantage of 3 years of past data often outperformed EARS [39] , whereas a seasonally adjusted cumulative sum (CUSUM) method did not [18] . Even though a number of explanations could help reconcile these results, we note that as the size of an epidemic signal increases relative to the background noise, outbreak recognition becomes easier and the performance of alternative detection methods becomes more and more difficult to distinguish [39, 41] . This rationale could explain why the GLM approach implemented by Jackson et al. did not add value under all conditions, but performed well with slow-escalating outbreaks qualitatively similar to the one used in our study [39] . In our particular real-world case, we found SARIMA to be more sensitive than EARS at discovering signals related to the pH1N1 pandemic wave that hit Baltimore in the summer of 2009. However, there was no associated timeliness advantage to SAR-IMA, as the initial peak of ARI cases was large enough to be picked by both statistical approaches. Given the variability in real-world outbreak signals, a negative finding for one specific outbreak does not reduce the impetus to design ever more sensitive and specific surveillance systems.\n"," We compared a CDA that used diagnostic codes, a staple data type for public health surveillance, to a CDA that took advantage of the EMR to cross-validate diagnostic codes with ARI symptoms documented in related clinical notes [8] . Our results extend our prior findings that EMR-enabled gains in case-detection performance can translate into faster outbreak detection [10] , adding that further timeliness can be achieved by incorporating historical data. Because we had previously measured the performance of these CDAs relative to a large reference record review [8] , we could augment the realism of our simulations by discounting the injected epidemic according to CDA sensitivity. This simulation framework supplied information that may prove helpful to public health practitioners: 1) insight into the achievable gains in detection timeliness could help justify investing into more complex epidemic detection approaches;\n"," 2) AMOC curves could be used to: a) adjust outbreak detection sensitivity according to a local jurisdiction's capacity to investigate alerts; or b) to estimate how much resources should be reallocated to surveillance activities during periods of increased threat [42] .\n"," Our results are confined to our experimental conditions and do not represent the final evolution of our own surveillance system, as we did not optimize individual system components, such as diagnostic code groupings, text analyses, case-or outbreak-detection approaches. The CDA-and SARIMA-related gains in detection timeliness may be related to characteristics of the epidemic, to the EMR software itself as well as to peculiarities in medical practices, care documentation and reimbursement. The EMR software and the processes of care that it supports could change over time. Thus, the performance of EMR-based systems may be more prone to variations than simpler systems, such as those based on stereotyped emergency room chief-complaints. The methods described in this work lack disease specificity compared to laboratory-based methods. Nevertheless, automated methods can incorporate available laboratory results and identify outbreaks for which diagnostic tests are not available. Their comparatively low costs also allow broad populations to be continuously monitored.\n"," Modeling long-term historical data with time series statistical methods can shorten the time it takes for an EMR-based surveillance system to discover epidemics of ARI. The empirical approach used to evaluate alternative surveillance systems may represent a useful blueprint for the growing efforts to harness the EMR to benefit public health [43] .\n"," Supporting information S1 File.

The Centre for Infectious Disease Control (CIb), part of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), is responsible for the coordination of current infectious disease control activities, in close collaboration with a large number of professionals and organizations, in case of an outbreak or an epidemic that cannot be controlled by the involved Public Health Service (PHS) alone because of the (anticipated) severity or extent of the event. There are 28 PHSs in The Netherlands, each one under municipal authority, organized in seven larg-er public health regions. To optimize collaboration, each of the seven regions has identified a public health doctor and a regional microbiologist as a liaison with the CIb; these 14 regional professionals have a part-time appointment at the CIb. The CIb also has the task of setting up an outbreak management team (OMT), consisting of fixed members and additional experts invited personally, in the case of a novel or unexpected outbreak of infectious diseases that may spread nationwide. To prepare for a potential outbreak and to support daily control activities, a response team can be formed immediately at the CIb after the first signs of an outbreak. The Health Council of The Netherlands is an independent scientific advisory body that provides the government and parliament with advice on issues concerning public health, including vaccination strategies.\n"," To guide pandemic preparations, static and dynamic mathematical transmission scenario studies had been conducted to estimate the potential impact on society and on the healthcare sector under various assumptions of a new human influenza pandemic [1, 2] .\n"," Then, in 2003, The Netherlands was unexpectedly confronted by a large outbreak of influenza A/H7N7 among poultry. Outbreak investigations were initiated, diagnostics were developed, and extensive control measures were implement-ed to stop transmission. This resulted in the culling of 30 million birds, 89 human infections were confirmed, and one casualty occurred [3] .\n"," This experience-as well as the threat of the SARS coronavirus in 2003, an ongoing threat of influenza A(H5N1), and the need to implement the new International Health Regulations-resulted in the development of multidisciplinary protocols for surveillance, diagnostics, communication, control, and research aimed at the various phases of a potential influenza pandemic. All were developed in close collaboration with regional laboratories and health services, and with the veterinary sector (since an avian introduction was considered highly likely) [4] .\n"," Thus, when the 2009 pandemic outbreak occurred, The Netherlands, with its 16.5 million inhabitants, should have been well prepared to monitor and control the outbreak. Here, we discuss several aspects of the actual management, with specific attention to vaccination strategies, and reflect on the lessons learned. nication tools, preparing research protocols, stockpiling of antivirals, and arrangements for advance purchase of pandemic vaccinations and for the distribution logistics.\n"," Three separate multidisciplinary evidence-based response guidelines had been developed coordinated by the CIb for the public health sector: one dealing with incidental introduction (with a focus on avian influenza, in view of the 2003 experience), another with a focus on dealing with early introduction of a potentially pandemic virus, and a third one to guide public health management during pandemic transmission. In these guidelines, detailed operational information for professionals on how to manage cases and to control transmission was given, and reference was made to the need for surveillance, diagnostic capacity, correct use of antivirals, and prioritizing of vaccinations.\n"," Furthermore, the professional organizations of general practitioners (GPs) [5] , nursing home physicians, and occupational health physicians had prepared their own guidelines in line with the public health guidelines. On a regional level, the safety regions developed pandemic plans in cooperation with the PHSs. In all regions these plans were audited by the Dutch Health Inspectorate using a fixed set of indicators. The Ministry of Health in liaison with the Ministry of Interior Affairs prepared intersectoral contingency planning, and private companies drafted their own contingency plans. The ministry together with the CIb prepared communication leaflets for the general public and an extensive set of Q&As, to be finalized and updated should a pandemic emerge.\n"," Routine surveillance of influenza was already strong in The Netherlands, with a sentinel GP network coordinated by NIV-EL (Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research) covering around 1% of the population dating back to 1970 providing influenza-like illness (ILI) trends by age, sex, and region [6, 7] . Since the 1992/1993 influenza season, in a subsample of ILI patients, centralized virology testing has been performed at the RIVM/CIb with additional data on vaccination and selected comorbidity available. To strengthen this, efforts were made to increase the number of participating GPs, to increase the amount of sampling, and to develop a more systematic approach to sampling and data collection. To enable surveillance of more severe outcomes, GPs monitoring ILI were also asked to monitor pneumonia. Furthermore, a sentinel nursing home network was started in 2006, which included influenza/ILI and pneumonia surveillance, similar to the GP sentinel surveillance [8] .\n"," Influenza virus surveillance is also routinely undertaken by the Erasmus Medical Centre at Rotterdam University, where influenza virus isolates are typed and analyzed from hospitalized patients as well as ILI patients presenting to sentinel outpatient services, providing input for WHO vaccine selection. Erasmus Medical Center together with RIVM/CIb forms the Dutch National Influenza Centre (NIC), which collaborates with NIV-EL for the GP sentinel surveillance. Together they ensure continuous online weekly updates of the influenza situation and weekly newsletters are provided during influenza epidemics. At Erasmus Medical Center, viruses from the sentinel surveillance and from selected hospitalized patients are subtyped on a routine basis. In the preparation for a potential emergence of antiviral resistant virus variants, if (stockpiled) antivirals would be widely used, the NIC developed assays to detect such variants [9, 10] . Using these assays, the NIC and other dedicated laboratories were able to characterize the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) influenza viruses during the 2007/2008 season and during the pandemic [11, 12] . Finally, as part of a routine pathogen surveillance program, a number of medical microbiology laboratories throughout the country report the weekly number of positive laboratory results for influenza virus and other respiratory viruses.\n"," Staff of the RIVM/CIb actively participated in several meetings that were organized by ECDC in the years before the 2009 pandemic. This included discussions on a range of options for\"surveillance in a pandemic. \" While some countries favored alternative surveillance instruments, for example, based on telephone consultations, The Netherlands decided to rely on the existing GP and nursing home sentinel surveillance systems.\n"," During a pandemic, testing requests could be expected to increase sharply, both owing to the large number of expected influenza patients and the increased need to exclude influenza among people who could be infected [4] . To ensure sufficient laboratory capacity would be available, the RIVM with local laboratories developed a method to ensure rapid scaling up, using standardized protocols [13] .\n"," A generic research proposal to study transmission risks following the introduction of a new influenza virus was prepared and received ethical approval in 2006. This facilitated combined epidemiological, clinical, veterinarian, virological, immunological, and perception research among cases and controls during the 2009 pandemic [12, 14, 15, 16] . The proposal included a\"first few hundreds\" approach, and enabled the conduct of a serosurvey among a random subsample of the population before and after the pandemic [17] .\n"," Analysis of previous pandemics and mathematical modeling studies had shown that once a new transmissible influenza virus would start to circulate locally among humans it could be contained if immediate stringent control measures were taken, but that once it started spreading, it would be only a matter of time before it would be a global problem. So unless a pandemic started in The Netherlands, whereby an attempt at containment could be made [18] , control efforts should be focused on mitigating the impact on society at large and the health sector in particular, and on protecting those at risk for severe outcomes. Modeling studies had shown that therapeutic use of antivirals could reduce transmission, while also reducing the risks for those infected [2, 19, 20] , thus the Ministry of Health had purchased 5 million courses of oseltamivir in bulk in 2006, which was all repacked in individual sachets. This should cover the 30% of the population estimated to develop a symptomatic infection during a pandemic. Furthermore, the ministry started negotiations with vaccine producers to ensure rapid delivery of 34 million doses of the pandemic vaccine once available; two doses for every Dutch citizen, based on the assumption that two doses would be needed to achieve sufficient protection against a novel influenza virus.\n"," After the first introduction of the virus in The Netherlands on 27 April 2009 from a child returning from Mexico, the number of imported cases gradually increased, but no sustained widespread community transmission occurred until October 2009 [26] . This early pandemic period was characterized by rapidly evolving insights in risks and management, based on incoming national and international data.\n"," Following the announcement of the WHO of an impending pandemic in late April 2009, the existing protocols for incidental introduction were made operational, with the aim of preventing transmission. Surveillance was strengthened by making confirmed influenza A(H1N1) pdm infection notifiable. Diagnostic capacity was strengthened by sharing standardized protocols for virological testing [13] . Initially, diagnostics was only performed at RIVM and Erasmus Medical Center; in parallel because the available tests were not yet sufficiently validated for the new virus. During this phase, about ten regional laboratories were validating their assays and when the virus was introduced in The Netherlands and the diagnostic capacity needed to be extended, these ten laboratories were able to take over the diagnostics from the RIVM and Erasmus Medical Center.\n"," A response team was formed at the RIVM/CIb that met daily (later twice weekly) to discuss the latest developments. Conclusions of the response team were discussed with the ministry on a daily basis through videoconference. Several OMT meetings were convened, where advice for the Ministry of Health was formulated on appropriate control interventions, such as social distancing, closing\n"," Bundesgesundheitsbl 2013 · 56:67-75 DOI 10.1007/s00103-012-1582-4 © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012\n"," Abstract Prior to 2009, The Netherlands had prepared itself extensively for a potential pandemic. Multidisciplinary guidelines had been drafted to control transmission and limit adverse outcomes for both a phase of early incidental introduction and for a phase with widespread transmission. The Ministry of Health had ensured a supply and distribution schedule for antivirals and negotiated a contract for vaccine purchases. During the pandemic, existing surveillance was expanded, the established infectious disease response structure was activated, and the previously prepared protocols for communication, diagnostics, use of antivirals, and vaccination implementation were operationalized and implemented.\n"," When the pandemic turned out to be less severe than many had anticipated, risk communication and rapid modification of guidelines and communication became a major challenge. Antivirals and pandemic vaccines were reserved for those at high risk for severe outcomes only. Overall, the impact of the pandemic was comparable to the impact of an average seasonal influenza epidemic, but with a shift in (severe) outcomes from the very young and elderly toward young adults. Established prepared protocols enabled timely coordinated responses. In preparing for the worst, sufficient attention must be given to preparing for a mild scenario as well. \n"," Influenzapandemie 2009 · Impfung · Niederlande · Vorbereitung · Kontrolle borders, use of masks, use of antivirals. Information for the public and for professionals was made available via the RIVM website, updated on a weekly basis. The RIVM/CIb provided information to public health professionals directly by a bidirectional communication tool distributed by e-mail (Inf@ct). The preparedness and response unit of the RIVM/CIb routinely has a 24/7 availability rooster to assist public health professionals, which proved to be very valuable during these early days as well.\n"," In June, the ministry decided to order 34 million doses of pandemic vaccine.\n"," In spite of all preparations, and the rapid designation of pandemic influenza as a notifiable disease, considerable effort was needed to have an operational case register, combining in a systematic way all relevant data for individual case management, control, surveillance, and outbreak investigations [21] . In particular, the different needs of those providing data inputs, and general privacy concerns, needed to be dealt with during a hectic period. Also, the amount of resources needed to identify and follow up all (suspected) patients and their contacts threatened to stretch the capacity and support of the PHSs to the limit. Therefore, the workload for the public health sector in the early days of the pandemic was very high, raising concerns about the ability to maintain such intensive efforts over a prolonged period of time, particularly because it was unknown at that moment if the worst was still to come.\n"," Furthermore, the lack of a surveillance of severe outcomes was felt as a major weakness, and therefore over the summer, a weekly surveillance system among pediatric ICUs was set up as the most feasible method to bridge this gap during an ongoing outbreak. Collaboration with Statistics Netherlands ensured that weekly data on all-cause mortality by age, sex, and region were sent to the RIVM/CIb to allow real-time monitoring of mortality trends.\n"," Early control efforts included a social distancing approach toward the first cases and their contacts, as well as providing leaflets to travelers arriving by plane from endemic areas asking them to report fever if it developed [22] . Modeling had shown that closure of borders was unlikely to be an efficient way to delay introduction [23] . The PHSs visited each of these cases; nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were taken. Confirmed cases and contacts were offered antivirals (oseltamivir) and patients were requested to stay at home for 10 days from the start of onset. Detailed household studies provided important data on transmission parameters such as R 0 and generation intervals, which were used to update existing transmission models already developed to guide and support control [24] . Cases and their contacts were furthermore requested to participate in the prepared influenza research protocol. With the increase in individual cases and with the accumulating data that the pandemic virus generally caused mild disease, comparable to seasonal influenza, support for this delay policy through social distancing and reduction of transmission declined. The epidemiology data of the early phase were published both nationally and internationally ( [25, 26] , . Fig. 1 ).\n"," On 22 June, the OMT advised that there was no longer a rationale to continue this intensive containment approach, in view of ongoing introductions and subsequent transmission, the mild character of most infections so far, the excessive burden this was placing on the PHSs, and the limited adherence. On 15 August 2009, the official notification requirements were modified, in that only hospitalizations and deaths with laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza needed to be notified.\n"," The OMT had requested a group of clinical experts to prepare guidelines on the clinical indications for use of antivirals; these guidelines in essence restricted use of antivirals to those with increased risk for adverse outcomes once infected, in line with the recognized risk groups for vaccination [27] . This meant that existing guidelines had to be adapted. Finally, the RIVM/CIb set up a working group with intensive care physicians to estimate available capacity and prepare contingency plans if needed.\n"," By the time schools reopened after the summer holidays in The Netherlands, between mid-August and early September, the evidence for a modest clinical impact was increasing. Transmission and clinical impact remained at low levels until over a month after reopening of the schools; there had been no spring or summer wave in The Netherlands. Due to the cessation of the notification, and the inability to track the epidemic progression in the regular GP surveillance owing to its low intensity, the number of reported hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths was the most informative real-time data source, recognizing that this created a bias toward monitoring severe outcomes. To adjust for delay in notifications, modeling experience was used to enable nowcasting of the epidemic [28] . Temporary school closure as a method to delay and reduce the peak incidence had been a control option considered in the preparation for an epidemic phase [29, 30] . The general mild character of the pandemic versus the potentially considerable societal and economic fall-out of temporary school closures made this strategy no longer proportional. Although some individual schools did close (in part or in full) when faced with a large degree of flu absenteeism, overall this remained a rare event.\n"," Nevertheless, anxiety among healthcare professionals in particular remained high. In spite of the lifting of the policy to delay epidemic introduction, PHSs remained extremely busy, and it was therefore decided to postpone the introduction of the annual national HPV campaign for 12-year-old girls, as this would have stretched the PHSs even further and might also jeopardize uptake in the pandemic vaccination campaigns. Furthermore, pediatricians were worried of being overwhelmed with ill babies and young children in the hospitals. Among the general public, there was on the one hand a feeling that the threat was overestimated, but on the other hand there was also still fear of an unpredictable severe course, in particular when the death of previously healthy children in the beginning of the epidemic was picked up by the media and widely publicized. Trust in government communication was in general high, but declined during the course of the pandemic [31] .\n"," The epidemic actually took off in the first week of October (week 41), when the ILI epidemic threshold in the sentinel surveillance was surpassed (>5.1 ILI Weekly surveillance updates were provided on the RIVM website starting in June (. Fig. 1) , accompanied by weekly wellattended press conferences beginning in August whereby the director of the CIb would give a brief update and answer press questions. Specific themes were highlighted during each week, e.g., vaccination, side effects, etc..\n"," The pandemic season lasted for 10 weeks and included the autumn midterm school breaks: week 43 for the northern and central part of The Netherlands and week 44 for the southern part. The epidemic peaked in week 45; in week 1 of 2010, the last regular pandemic surveillance update was published. An overall overview based on notified patients was published in Eurosurveillance [32] . A pre-and postpandemic population-based serologic survey showed that the overall attack rate was low (7.6%) in the general population, but high (35%) in 5-19-year-olds. Hospitalization and mortality rates per infection increased significantly with age [17] . Overall mortality was comparable to seasonal epidemics, but a clear shift in mortality toward younger age groups was found [33, 34] . Use of antivirals among nonhospitalized patients with an indication for use remained low (Hooij veld et al., manuscript submitted). Viral resistance monitoring continued, and in spite of the detection of several resistant viruses, no sustained transmission occurred [12] . Notification of hospitalized and deceased patients continued until after the 2010-2011 season [33] .\n"," Overall, the high infection attack rate in children and very low attack rate in older adults, together with the low severity of illness per infection in children but substantial severity in older adults, produced an epidemic with a low overall impact and a comparable burden of disease to seasonal epidemics ( [35, 36, 37] , . Fig. 2, 3 ).\n"," In The Netherlands, childhood vaccinations included in the Dutch National Immunization Programe are delivered by PHSs free of charge to the recipients. Children or their parents are invited once a vaccination is due. This results in a high overall uptake. Seasonal influenza vacci- nation for high-risk groups, including the elderly, is delivered by GPs and by nursing homes, also free of charge for the eligible groups.\n"," Prior to the pandemic, the Dutch Health Council had discussed which groups should be vaccinated first in case availability of vaccines would be lower than needed. Priority should be given to those at highest risk for severe outcomes, followed by healthcare workers. When over the summer of 2009 more and more data became available that in general the infection did not lead to severe outcome, the Health Council advised in August that for pandemic vaccination the same risk groups as for seasonal vaccination should be targeted (i.e., people with underlying conditions, people 60 years of age and above, and healthcare professionals) with the addition of pregnant women, as these were the groups considered at highest risk of severe adverse outcomes. Thereby, vaccination was primarily intended to reduce severe morbidity and mortality, not to interrupt transmission. Although data on the effectiveness of a single dose of vaccination in healthy adults became available, the Health Council advised to maintain a two-dose schedule, as they considered there were insufficient data available to assess effectiveness for the risk groups targeted in The Netherlands (not healthy adults), and no shortage was foreseen.\n"," Pandemic vaccination for these risk groups was implemented by the GPs, as this is a successful and tested strategy for seasonal vaccination of risk groups. GPs receive a financial compensation for each vaccinated person, and influenza vaccination is free of charge for those with a recommendation to receive the vaccine [as is the case for all (targeted) vaccinations provided by the government]. Overall, seasonal influenza vaccination uptake for medical risk groups below the age of 65 years is around 70% and for the elderly over 80% [6] . Monitoring of uptake in these groups was as always done via GP registers. Vaccination of healthcare professionals is organized by the health sector. Seasonal uptake in this group is hard to assess, but in general estimated to be around 20% for nursing home staff [38] and over 50% for GPs [39] . Vaccination uptake in pregnant women, a new target group, was hardest to assess, as no routine structure was available. Therefore, this was assessed via retrospective questionnaires among pregnant women [40] .\n"," Making use of these existing structures, pandemic vaccination was rolled out as soon as vaccines were available. Seasonal vaccination had gone ahead as scheduled for healthcare staff, the elderly, and medical risk groups in October, followed by the start of pandemic vaccination early November with Pandemrix® for these same groups, plus pregnant wom-en and for healthcare professionals, with a second dose offered after 2 weeks.\n"," In early November 2009, concern about potential overburdening of the health services by sick young children, in particular children too young to be treated with antivirals, led to an additional recommendation to vaccinate all children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, as well as the caretakers of babies between 0 and 6 months. Vaccinations of children in The Netherlands are routinely provided through the PHS. Apart from the routine infant and child vaccinations, protocols existed for mass vaccination campaigns, and had been used and tested for a meningitis B vaccination campaign in 2003 [41] . Mass vaccination of children with Focetria® was started in late November, with the second dose offered 2 weeks later in the beginning of December.\n"," This approach meant that the implementation of a pandemic vaccination strategy could build on established and tested practices, including trust between the people invited and the people inviting. Thus, in spite of ongoing discussions in the media regarding the need for pandemic vaccination (\"mild epidemic\"), concerns about limited data on long-term safety of adjuvanted novel vaccines, and extensive media attention for potential conflict of interests between pharmacy and government advisors, the overall uptake of pandemic vaccination was good, comparable to uptake of seasonal vaccination for those eligible ( [40, 42, 43] , . Tab. 1, 2). Comparable to the situation with seasonal vaccination, uptake among healthcare workers was the main challenge. Employers are responsible to order and distribute the vaccines. For institutions with no prior experience in annual seasonal vaccination campaigns, this was a major challenge. A helpdesk for the ordering and logistic issues was established at the RIVM, as the RIVM was responsible for the logistics of the vaccination distributions.\n"," Uptake of the second dose was between 80 and 90% of the first dose in the different target groups (. Tab. 1, 2) . Overall, an estimated one third of the population (5 million people) was vaccinated.\n"," In view of the use of a novel vaccine, intensified monitoring for side effects was conducted by the RIVM/CIb togeth- \n"," Extensive evaluations have been conducted by many involved parties in The Netherlands, aided by a detailed chronological overview of events [46] . The longterm multidisciplinary preparation for a pandemic, as well as the strong structure established for control and communication, proved crucial for a coordinated response. Guidelines, surveillance, mathematical modeling could all build on each other's contributions and strengths. This is despite the fact that a (severe) pandemic caused by an avian influenza virus originating from Asia was anticipated, rather than a (relatively mild) swine-origin virus from Mexico.\n"," Nevertheless, how to communicate that preparing for the worst does not imply that the worst will happen remained a challenge. Sufficient attention in preparing for mild scenarios too might save resources, facilitate risk communication, optimize the effectiveness of control, and increase trust in authorities.\n"," Also, even with many guidelines in place, a great amount of effort was required to assess the continuous flow of more and more new data both in the scientific and in the lay press about the impact of the pandemic on individuals and on the population level, and about the effectiveness of interventions. Such data had to be evaluated for their scientific merit, assessed against available local data as well as their relevance to the specific Dutch situation. Estimations of impact based on modeled assumptions had to be updated rapidly as new data became available. On the one hand, maximum flexibility was needed to modify guidelines and procedures where indicated [47] , on the other hand, continuity in control and communication was essential as well.\n"," Furthermore, in spite of numerous exercises and a stand-by multisectoral database, a significant amount of effort was needed to collect and analyze all incoming data from clinicians, laboratories, and public health officials in a standardized and structured way, which put stress on (internal) communications and reduced the potential for rapid outbreak investigations [21] .\n"," Surveillance benefited from well-established routines and longitudinal data. Setting up SARI surveillance during the pandemic was only feasible because of the strong commitment of a well-identified group of pediatric ICUs; work is still ongoing to try and make this a part of routine surveillance.\n"," In a crisis such as a pandemic, good generic preparation is essential, as this enables building on established practices and trust. However, the continuous media attention and shifting public opinions, along with rapidly accumulating scientific data, necessitates maximum flexibility so as to maintain effective and credible management. \n","Score: 6.797561912917601\n","\n","Title: Impact of respiratory infectious epidemics on STEMI incidence and care\n","Body Text: Multiple triggers of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were described previously, but the effect of respiratory infectious diseases on STEMI incidence is not well understood. The effect of these infectious diseases on treatment of patients with STEMI is not well investigated. The Influenza 2017/2018 season and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were chosen as observational periods to investigate the effect of respiratory virus diseases on STEMI incidence and treatment in a metropolitan area with a preexisting STEMI network. COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 1 . Previous studies and expert opinions around the world raised concerns about a trend towards decreased ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) admissions, prehospital treatment delay, as well as an overwhelmed medical system caused by the pandemic [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . STEMI patients suffer from high mortality and morbidity rates, thus requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment 8 . After the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was documented in Germany on January 27, 2020. On February 25, 2020, the first person in the German state of North Rhine Westphalia was diagnosed with COVID-19. The government of North Rhine Westphalia issued containment recommendations to hospitals on March 3, 2020, and passed a coronavirus executive order on March 22, 2020 9 . This lockdown resulted in contact restrictions, remote work and an extreme reduction of public life and mobility.\n"," On the contrary, the Influenza 2017/2018 season-which was declared as epidemic in Europe and was a prototype of a seasonal respiratory infectious disease with high disease burden-did not lead to the implementation of comparable containment recommendations or executive orders 10 . The influenza season in general was described as predictor of increased incidence of myocardial infarction and might raise the cardiovascular risk of patients with coronary artery disease [11] [12] [13] . During the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic in Germany 334,000 patients were diagnosed with influenza, of these, 60,000 required hospitalization 10 . The Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic resulted in a doubling of the registered influenza-caused deaths compared to the prior season 2016/2017 10 . The effect of this disease burden on the treatment of STEMI patients was not investigated before.\n"," The current study aims to clarify the role of the recurrent influenza season on STEMI care exemplified by the 2017/2018 season. This study was also conducted to evaluate the hypothesized concerns about a decrease in STEMI admissions and treatment delay during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it addressed patient-and system-related delay in a myocardial infarction network in the city of Cologne, Germany 14,15 .\n"," Study design and population. This prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study included all STEMI patients diagnosed and treated within the period of December 1, 2013 to April 30, 2020 in the city of Cologne, Germany. The concept of the Cologne Infarction Model network (\"Kölner Infarkt Modell\", KIM) has been described previously 14, 15 . Briefly, KIM is a co-operation between all sixteen hospitals and the emergency medical services in the 400 km 2 area of Cologne, Germany, populated by about 1 million people. Seven out of sixteen hospitals feature percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) capabilities 24 h a day, 7 days a week. STEMI patients who first presented to emergency medical service were directly transferred to the catheterization laboratories of those PCI centers. Patients who presented to non-PCI hospitals were immediately transferred to hospitals with catheterization laboratory capabilities. Guideline conform STEMI diagnosis required typical symptoms in the presence of either ST-segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads or assumed new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) on a 12-lead electrocardiogram 8, 16 . All patients with STEMI and a complete report on treatment periods reflecting pre-clinical and in-hospital delay were eligible for the current analysis. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was issued by the local ethics committee of the University of Cologne (No. 06-064) and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The KIM registry is funded by the KIM registered association.\n"," Observational period. The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic began on January 27, 2020 and ended around April 30, 2020 in Germany 17 . We chose this timeframe for the COVID-19 pandemic observational group. This group was compared to a seasonal control group (pandemic season control group), including all patients treated between January 27 and April, 30 between the years 2014 to 2019. All other patients were excluded because of a potential seasonal effect on health care provision and patients' behavior.\n"," The (1) symptom-to-contact time (S2C, defined as the period from symptom-onset to first medial contact), (2) contact-to-balloon time (C2B, defined as the period from first medical contact to balloon inflation), and (3) door-to-balloon time (D2B, defined as the period from arrival at the PCI-hospital to balloon inflation). Additionally, data on mortality, procedural In the comparison of both respiratory infectious diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic had longer S2C, C2B and D2B intervals, but none of these differences was significantly different (see Table 2b ).\n"," Procedural data. The radial artery was the predominant access route in the COVID-19 pandemic and the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group (see Table 3 ). These proportions were statistically significant different compared to those from the seasonal control groups, as the femoral artery puncture were performed in 64.2 and 70.2 of all procedures in the historical cohorts (p < 0.001). Angiography revealed that LAD occlusion was the most frequent cause of STEMI in all patients, but the proportion of LAD occlusion was significantly higher in patients of the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group (55.6%) in comparison to the epidemic season control group (36.7%, p = 0.011). Myocardial infarction of the inferior wall either caused by occlusion of RCA or subsequent branches was the second most common cause for STEMI. After primary angiography 39 patients were transferred to urgent CABG operation. In the remaining cohort, interventional reperfusion (TIMI I-III) was achieved in all but 142 patients.\n"," Peri-interventional complications occurred in 8.5% of patients in the COVID-19 pandemic and 5.9% of patients in the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic group (see Table 4 ). The corresponding rates were 14.6% and 14.8% for the seasonal control groups. Specifically, in-hospital mortality was 6.1% for COVID-19 pandemic group and 11.0% for the pandemic season control group (p = 0.129). Corresponding rates were 5.9% for the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and 11.2% for the related epidemic season control group (p = 0.333).\n"," Major findings. The incidence of STEMI in the metropolitan area of Cologne was steady during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic or the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic. We observed adequate intervals between first medical contact and revascularization. In detailed analysis, both diseases demonstrated a trend towards an increased patient-related delay compared to each corresponding seasonal control group without significant differences. Additionally, the current analysis showed a prolonged door-to-balloon time during the COVID-19 pandemic. The direct comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic and Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic did not demonstrate a significant difference regarding system-or patient-related delay. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ STEMI incidence. The incidence of STEMI was not significantly affected by the respiratory virus diseases in this registry analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis on the effect of the Influenza 2017/2018 season on STEMI care. Over the past years, only few studies investigating the effect of influenza season on myocardial infarction and especially on STEMI incidence or care were published [11] [12] [13] . An analysis of the SWEDEHEART registry demonstrated an increased risk of myocardial infarction during the yearly influenza season and a correlation with influenza burden 11 . In a subgroup analysis STEMI patients were not at higher risk for cardiovascular mortality during the influenza season 11 . This result is in line with the current study 11 . Registry data in the United States demonstrated that influenza infection was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with myocardial infarction 13 . Concomitant influenza infection and myocardial infarction reduced the rate of revascularization rate significantly 12, 13 . On the contrary, a large amount of studies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect on patients with STEMI have been published over the last year. Studies done in Europe and China documented a decrease in hospital admissions for STEMI 2,18-20 . De Rosa et al. reported a 26.5% reduction of STEMI admission during a 1 week period and Scholz et al. detected a 12.6% decrease during a 1 month period 18, 20 . All of these studies were observational studies or registries and might have underreported the true incidence of STEMI during the respiratory virus epidemic and pandemic. Treatment delay. Regarding the STEMI treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic the S2C, C2B and D2B\n"," were longer compared to the pandemic season control group, but only the D2B was significantly prolonged. The median S2C was 180 min and this was a doubling in comparison to the pandemic season control group. As this was not a statistical significant difference, careful interpretation is required. Nevertheless this difference might have clinical impact and is in line with observations in Europe and Asia. De Rosa et al. and Gramegna et al. observed a relevant patient-related delay with a prolonged symptom-to-hospital and contact-to-balloon time during the COVID-19 pandemic 18, 21 . Interestingly, these studies took place in outbreak areas during the climax of the early COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. A German analysis of 15,800 patients documented comparable S2C, C2B and D2B times for the COVID-19 pandemic and control group without any significant differences 20 . Multiple studies documented an increase or a trend towards a patient-related delay during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the extent differs between the trials [3] [4] [5] 19, 20 The reasons for patient-related delay are still under consideration. Altruistic behavior has been intensively discussed. One might further argue that patients avoided hospitals as they represent the focus of this viral disease, and because hospitals were confronted by an excessive demand of intensive care unit capacities by COVID-19 patients. These circumstances might also be an explanation for the observed prolonged D2B time in the current analysis. Results by a meta-analysis from Rattka et al. evolving around 50,000 participants also demonstrated a similar increase in D2B time for the COVID-19 group 22 . Mortality. The registry data indicate a deceased mortality during the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic period. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, we speculate that the availability of resources due to the reduction in elective procedures could have had an impact on these outcomes. On the other hand, a potentially increased local sudden cardiac death rate might have improved the in-hospital outcome (survivorship bias). The current local death rate of the city of Cologne, Germany is not available, hence the true explanation of this phenomenon is still pending and might be addressed in future studies. Until April 30, 2020, less than 0.24% (N = 2346) of the total population had a SARS-CoV-2 infection 17 . In contrast, reports by De Rosa et al. and Gramegna et al. included hospitals from outbreak areas with much higher incidence of COVID-19 infections. This might not only have influenced the system, but also the patient-related delay 18, 21 . Inherent limitations of registry studies also affected the current analysis. A short follow-up period, underreporting of outcome data, limited availability of patient characteristics including comorbidities and treatment data leading to missing data restrict the generalizability of our results. Assessment of subjective variables (e.g. symptom onset) and data management by diverse centers might also influence the study results. One additional limitation is the lack of information on the incidence of influenza infection or antiviral treatment in the cohorts. Unfortunately these variables are not part of the KIM registry, but might have biased the current analysis.\n"," Another important aspect is the local structure of Cologne with a dense structure of hospitals with short transfer periods and the small sample size in the KIM registry. The current analysis is also restricted by the low number of events especially in the observational groups.\n"," A well-structured co-operation of emergency medical service and local hospitals in a metropolitan area was able to overcome the challenges in the treatment of patients with STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Influenza 2017/2018 epidemic. In the setting of this network, these respiratory infectious diseases did not result in a significant overall treatment delay. These virus infections did neither cause an increase in \"STEMI incidence\" section, nor did they raise the STEMI mortality. Nonetheless, both diseases showed a trend towards an increased patient-related delay. Educational programs should address the observed patient-related delay and emphasize the need for immediate contact of the medical system. Additionally, the results demonstrated a significantly prolonged door-to-balloon time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adequate strategies to minimize this delay and improve health care service balancing prompt treatment and infection protection are needed. \n","Score: 6.77095855902464\n","\n","Title: Challenges and Adaptation of a European Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Study Platform in Response to the COVID-19 Emergence: Experience from the DRIVE Project\n","Body Text: The 'Development of Robust and Innovative Vaccine Effectiveness' (DRIVE) (https: //www.drive-eu.org/) project was launched as a five-year public-private partnership in order to respond to a guideline issued in 2017 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), requesting vaccine manufacturers to provide a yearly brand-specific effectiveness evaluation for all influenza vaccines as part of their post-licensure regulatory requirements [1] .\n"," For this purpose, the European Commission, through the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), supported the DRIVE project, a pioneer public-private partnership (PPP) that advances European cooperation in influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) studies. The data generated through DRIVE are expected to increase the understanding of influenza vaccine effectiveness, lead to enhanced monitoring of influenza vaccine performance by public health institutes and allow manufacturers to fulfil regulatory requirements.\n"," DRIVE's main objective in its first pilot season (2017/2018) was to establish and test the feasibility of a new multi-country platform using a limited number of sites (five study sites from four different countries, see Table 1 ) [2] . Although the influenza season was severe, precise IVE estimates were not obtained due in part to the limited number of participating study sites and the resultant limited sample size. However, DRIVE succeeded in setting up the IVE study platform and implementing DRIVE generic protocols and standard operating procedures across the different sites. Table 1 . Evolution of DRIVE study platform in the years since its start in 2017. Specified information includes the number of participant study sites/European countries; total number of general practitioners (GP)/hospitals participating in the test-negative design (TND) studies; number of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases and laboratory-confirmed influenza (LCI) recruited in the TND; figures for the register-based cohort studies and influenza vaccine brands captured in DRIVE dataset. For the 2018/2019 season, the network expanded from 5 to 13 sites from seven different European countries (Table 1) . DRIVE protocols were further harmonized, the statistical analysis plan was improved, and age-and setting-stratified IVE estimates were calculated [2, 3] . Furthermore, a post hoc analysis of the 2018/2019 data allowed for the simplification of the confounders that were considered for the following season, 2019/2020, permitting the participation of study sites that had limited data on confounders and avoiding potential over-adjustment [4, 5] .\n"," In 2019/2020, DRIVE continued its expansion and included 14 sites from eight different European countries. For the 2019/2020 season, four primary-care-based test-negative design (TND) studies (Austria, England, Italy and the UK), eight hospital-based TND studies (Finland, France, Italy, Romania, Spain) and one register-based cohort study (Finland) were conducted (Table 1, Figure 1 ). The COVID-19 outbreak impacted influenza surveillance; thus, the study period for the main analysis was truncated. The pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures interfered with and capped an already mild influenza circulation and impacted data collection within DRIVE study sites. Despite all these challenges, precise brand-specific estimates were obtained from the pooled TND studies in DRIVE, in addition to those from the population-based cohort study [2] . Fourteen study sites from a total of eight different European countries collected data for DRIVE during the 2019/2020 influenza season. In total, there were 19 hospitals and 388 GPs for the TND studies and more than 1.5 million subjects for the register-based cohort study.\n"," COVID-19 Europe-wide circulation started in February 2020 and overlapped with the 2019/2020 influenza season only for a few weeks between the end of February and beginning of March [6] . Thus, there was not an actual co-epidemic of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in the 2019/2020 season in Europe; however, COVID-19 and influenza are both respiratory infectious diseases with similar clinical presentation. As a consequence, the COVID-19 pandemic directly impacted influenza surveillance systems and data collection at the DRIVE study sites (this will be described in detail in the next sections).\n"," First, the COVID-19 health crisis has pushed healthcare systems to the limit of their capacities or beyond and has changed health-care-seeking behaviors for people presenting influenza like illness (ILI) symptoms.\n"," Second, measures taken by public health authorities and governments to reduce virus spread, such as containment, social distancing and lockdown, for COVID-19 dramatically affected the transmission of other infectious diseases such as influenza.\n"," Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic forced several sites to stop the inclusion of influenza cases in early March, mostly due to lockdown measures, safety measures within the hospitals, COVID-19-related work overload and clinical staff being diverted to COVID-19related tasks (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 testing and clinical management of COVID-19 patients). Overall, data collection for DRIVE and testing for influenza was de-prioritized, and as a consequence, the last influenza swabs of the season were collected in mid-March of 2020.\n"," The DRIVE study period for the 2019/2020 season effectively ended in week 12 of 2020 in all study sites (as the study period end was defined as the week prior to the first of two consecutive weeks when no influenza viruses were detected) [2] .\n"," Altogether, the previous points highlighted DRIVE's necessity to account for the COVID-19 pandemic in the IVE study platform.\n"," 2.1. DRIVE IVE Study Platform and COVID-19: Actions Taken in the 2019/2020 Season DRIVE updated both the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and the IVE results report for the 2019/2020 season to account for the altered COVID-19 case management and influenza surveillance among study sites (i.e., study period and sensitivity analysis).\n"," At the site level, the end of the study period was defined as either the week prior to the first of two consecutive weeks when no influenza viruses were detected, or the previously set end of the study period (30 April 2020), whichever occurred first. As illustrated in Figure 2 and described in Table 2 , several sites stopped collecting data by the beginning of March. Moreover, the influenza season was shorter than expected due to the lockdown, social distancing and other COVID-19 protective measures; thus, no influenza-positive swabs were collected beyond week 12 of 2020. Therefore, the end of the study period for the main analysis was established as 29 February 2020 (two months earlier than the originally established date of 30 April 2020). New study period adjusted due to COVID-19 pandemic. Study period for main analysis was considered until 29 February 2020; sensitivity analysis considered data collected until 30 April 2020. However, the actual study period end (defined as first week of two subsequent weeks of no influenza cases detected) was in week 12 of 2020 at all DRIVE sites, indicating there was no more influenza circulating even at the sites that did still collect data beyond end of February. Only showing TND studies.\n"," A sensitivity analysis that included data up to 30 April was performed. All local study periods effectively ended before 30 April ( Figure 2 ), but no more influenza positive tests were reported after week 12. Precise IVE estimates in the main analysis were similar to the estimations obtained from the sensitivity analysis with the extended study period, and two additional estimates with a confidence interval (CI) width of <40% were obtained [2, 7] .\n"," DRIVE study sites did not exclude COVID-19 cases from the DRIVE study for the 2019/2020 season. This is in line with previous DRIVE seasons, in which test results for respiratory viruses other than influenza did not impact the inclusion of subjects. Thus, COVID-19 patients were only excluded from DRIVE study if they met the regular DRIVE exclusion criteria. However, data on the COVID-19 status of subjects recruited was not collected as this was not foreseen in the DRIVE protocol for the 2019/2020 season. Continued data collection until 30 April 2020 (DRIVE initial data cut-off)\n"," Since there was one staff member dedicated exclusively to reviewing and entering the DRIVE data, the study site could collect all the information needed for the project.\n"," Hospital setting (1 hospital) 15 adults ** 21 older adults *** Yes, samples from all SARI cases admitted to the hospital were only tested for SARS-CoV-2 and no subsequent PCR testing for influenza was performed.\n"," Yes, all SARI cases arriving to the hospital were managed as COVID-19 cases, so they were isolated and immediately tested for SARS-CoV-2 (and not for influenza). No, screening of SARI cases was not affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. 16 March 2020 Continued data collection until 30 April 2020 (DRIVE initial data cut-off)\n"," Hospital setting (5 hospitals) 134 adults ** 246 older adults *** No, however, the FLUVAC study protocol did not implement routinely SARS-Cov-2 testing, so patients hospitalized with SARI were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 at admission and the information on SARS-CoV-2 positivity was initially missing. However, all samples were stored to be re-analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 later on.\n"," Yes, the algorithm for hospital screening of admitted patients was different between eligible SARI and suspected COVID-19 individuals, who were isolated. Thus, clinical research assistants of the IREIVAC centers did not get access to the samples of suspected COVID-19 patients for influenza testing. Continued data collection until 30 April 2020 (DRIVE initial data cut-off) Routine influenza screening at the primary care level almost stopped, as each patient requiring ICU admission got tested for SARS-CoV-2 only. This testing was performed in the respective hospitals and not at the GPs'; therefore, MUV was not able to get these samples for influenza testing. In the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, NIID was the designated facility for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and surveillance in Romania. All SARI cases admitted to the hospital were tested for both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, so the recruitment of cases for DRIVE studies did not stop. 16 March 2020\n"," Continued data collection until 30 April 2020 (DRIVE initial data cut-off) As of 22 March 2020, NIID switched to a COVID-19 hospital, so only COVID-19 cases were admitted. The screening for influenza was only performed for patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the vast majority of the influenza cases were admitted to other hospitals.\n"," Several DRIVE study sites implemented a different triage protocol in response to SARS-CoV-2 emergence, and all SARI cases arriving to the hospital were tested first for SARS-CoV-2; if results were negative, later tests were performed for other respiratory viruses such as influenza (Table 2 ). This new triage strategy was not expected to significantly reduce the number of influenza cases captured in the DRIVE dataset in 2019/2020, as very few cases of co-infection of influenza/SARS-CoV-2 were reported at the DRIVE sites that did test swabs for both viruses; this was due the minimal overlap between the influenza season and the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\n"," This section provides more details on the experiences of two DRIVE study sites in 2019/2020 in terms of management of the DRIVE study during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the challenges faced and solutions designed to overcome these challenges. Each of the study sites below approached the DRIVE study during the COVID-19 outbreak in different and unique ways: CIRI-IT, in Italy, had to deal with an intense COVID-19 outbreak, whereas HUS Jorvi Hospital in Finland faced a moderate COVID-19 outbreak. Until the first week of March 2020, the data collection for DRIVE was not affected by the COVID-19 emergency. However, later in March, the COVID-19 emergency affected the enrollment of SARI cases in all CIRI-IT hospitals and the enrollment of ILI cases by the CIRI-IT physicians and it resulted in an end to data collection for DRIVE (last SARI swab collected for DRIVE was 15 March 2020 in Siena hospital and last ILI swab was collected on 13 March 2020).\n"," During the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to minimize the possibility of contagion, ILI cases enrolled by the physicians' network and the patients admitted with SARI in the hospitals were regarded as \"suspected COVID-19 cases\". These subjects followed a new clinical pathway, which made it difficult to (a) collect useful information for filling in the questionnaire required by the DRIVE project, and (b) carry out PCR tests for the presence of influenza. These patients were initially subjected to laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 only. However, after testing for SARS-CoV-2, the swab sample from each patient was frozen, and testing for the detection of influenza was performed on the frozen samples later on. Accordingly, the collection date of the last swab positive for influenza was actually 13 March 2020 for the hospital study and 4 March 2020 for the primary care study, but the testing for influenza of those frozen samples was performed in April. In addition, patients and physicians were also contacted at a later stage to obtain the information necessary for the DRIVE study.\n"," In Finland, the COVID-19 pandemic remained moderate in comparison with countries such as Italy and Spain. DRIVE research collaborators in HUS were able to keep their staff working for DRIVE and did not stop collecting data for the DRIVE study, finishing data collection on 30 April, as initially scheduled. However, after the emergence of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown measures, influenza cases nearly disappeared (and, previously, the influenza season in Finland was also considered very mild). As a result, the number of influenza patients fell short of what was expected (33 vs. 74 last season). The influenza cases recruited for the DRIVE study in the 2019/2020 season were also included in a prospective observational study comparing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adult COVID-19 and influenza patients [8] .\n"," Suspected COVID-19 patients were recruited in the DRIVE study, as they fulfilled the SARI criteria, and the study site protocol accounted for SARS-CoV-2 testing. However, as SARS-CoV-2 testing was prioritized over influenza, sample logistics were disturbed and, in many cases, only SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was performed. Most of the samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 were stored for later re-analysis for influenza. Unfortunately, a small percentage of the stored samples were lost and consequently not re-analyzed for influenza.\n"," The HUS study site faced several other challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, patients could not be visited due to strict isolation, and thus it was difficult to obtain their informed consent. To overcome this problem, HUS implemented the strategy of oral witnessed consent. Oral consent was taken on the phone (on speaker, so the witness heard the conversation) or from outside the isolation area. The witness had to be a member of the hospital staff who was not included in the study team. The study nurse and the witness signed the consent form. Oral informed consent given by the next of kin was used in the same manner.\n"," Oral witnessed consent was a form of consent inbuilt to the HUS study protocol and was approved by their ethics committee. This form of consent was initially included as there was the possibility of influenza patients in the ICU who might not be able to give their written informed consent due to being too ill to write, but who could still give their oral consent. As it turned out, it was mostly needed for including seriously ill or isolated COVID-19 patients. During the COVID-19 epidemic, witnessed oral consent was very practical both for avoiding the risk of transmission and for saving PPE sorely needed by hospital staff.\n"," In the current COVID-19 pandemic context, it is expected that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses will co-circulate partially or entirely during the 2020/2021 season [9] , so the impact on the DRIVE study will likely be higher than in the 2019/2020 season. The change in health-seeking behavior and further lockdown policies due to subsequent COVID-19 pandemic waves in Europe, differences in vaccine recommendations and distribution, the standard of care and access to flu vaccination [10] , and further elements yet to be explored, will undoubtedly generate bias in IVE estimates and/or affect the operational execution of the IVE study platform.\n"," After consultation with EMA and IMI in April 2020, the DRIVE consortium decided to account for COVID-19 in its study documents (protocols, SAP, etc.) and operational procedures for the 2020/2021 season. Since then, DRIVE is closely tracking the evolution of the pandemic and liaising with the study sites to rapidly adapt to this ever-changing situation.\n"," Consequently, DRIVE will use the 2020/2021 season as a feasibility study for discussion on COVID-19 components that can be implemented in the study platform in order to better understand how COVID-19 would impact the brand-specific IVE. A few points should be considered:\n"," • SARS-CoV-2 virus infection could potentially be a confounder for the association between influenza vaccination and influenza disease [11] .\n"," In potential co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2, efforts to increase rates of influenza vaccination are important to reduce the additional influenza-related burden, particularly among groups at high risk of influenza complications and severe COVID-19 disease. Thus, COVID-19 might influence the influenza vaccine recommendations or its acceptance, increasing the differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated [12] .\n"," • There may also be differences in healthcare-seeking behavior for influenza vs. COVID-19 (e.g., at-risk individuals and severity of the new disease) leading to under-or over-estimation of IVE. • Co-infection may affect clinical outcomes and individual response to vaccine-derived protection for influenza.\n"," The standard of care and access to influenza vaccination might be impacted in the case of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation.\n"," DRIVE has updated its TND protocol for the 2020/2021 season in order to account for several of the COVID-19 particularities mentioned above. First, two COVID-19 related objectives were added to the protocol. A secondary objective is to estimate the COVID-19 impact on IVE within the adults/older adults in a hospital setting, given the COVID-19 epidemiology. As exploratory objective is to describe clinical signs and symptoms as well as laboratory features, around the point of admission, among hospitalized COVID-19 cases as compared to influenza cases.\n"," Moreover, the following variables will be collected across the study sites:\n"," • The collection of these variables is not mandatory for DRIVE study sites, but preferrable. Table 3 indicates which study sites will be able to collect COVID-19-related variables in the 2020/2021 season.\n"," Triage strategies will differ among sites in the 2020/2021 season ( Figure 3 , Table 3 ). The majority of the DRIVE study sites have established a common triage for all SARI/ILI cases, which will be tested simultaneously for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in multiplex RT-PCR. However, other sites will prioritize SARS-CoV-2 testing, and only those swabs testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 will be stored for subsequent influenza testing. Common triage (all SARI cases admitted). This study site avoids many of the problems generated by prospective studies and risk of COVID-19 infections by selecting the cases and controls from the influenza surveillance electronic system of Catalonia, so there will be no problem accessing patient data if isolated.\n"," Simultaneous RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, from the same swab. \n"," DRIVE has envisioned since its very beginning a vaccine effectiveness (VE) platform beyond influenza, which will eventually be able to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines for other respiratory diseases. The urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic and the imminence of the new COVID-19 vaccines has pushed DRIVE to move quickly and to leverage DRIVE assets to set up a COVID-19 VE platform as soon as possible.\n"," Because of the uncertainty of the allocation modalities, distribution and timing of early COVID-19 vaccine candidates in Europe, it will be very challenging to predict the level of uptake and ensure sufficient a sample size for VE studies [13, 14] . This will necessitate the set-up of large study network with wide geographical coverage. In addition, COVID-19 and influenza are both respiratory infectious diseases with similar clinical symptoms, respiratory specimens and laboratory tests as well as potentially having time periods leading to an overlap of surveillance [15, 16] . Biases may also be expected if they are not jointly considered.\n"," As presented in Figure 4 , DRIVE has developed several assets that can be leveraged to readily encompass SARS-CoV-2 in addition to influenza. DRIVE's existing brandspecific study platform, governance, tools and methods could be readily adapted to add COVID-19-specific components, allowing for limited start-up cost and increased efficiency. Thus, within the current vaccines' post-marketing landscape, DRIVE could potentially provide the base of a new study platform. leading the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness monitoring field. DRIVE key assets and achievements. Since its inception in 2017, DRIVE has achieved several milestones and developed key assets that make it a unique study platform for brand-specific VE studies in Europe. DRIVE has developed methods to pool brand-specific IVE data.\n"," DRIVE was able to obtain precise brand-specific IVE estimates in the 2019/2020 season despite the start of the COVID-19 pandemic during the influenza season [2] . This achievement reflects the soundness of the DRIVE study network and how well DRIVE study sites managed the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which have been reflected in the present paper. The pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures interfered with and capped an already mild influenza circulation and impacted data collection within DRIVE study sites.\n"," COVID-19 will also have a significant impact on the DRIVE study platform for the 2020/2021 season, both in terms of epidemiology and data collection at DRIVE study sites. In order to better interpret IVE, the DRIVE generic protocol for TND studies and SAP has been adapted to encompass several COVID-19 components regarding the operational aspects of data collection and analysis. These adaptations aim to estimate the COVID-19 impact on IVE and to compare clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and influenza cases at the time of hospital admission. The COVID-19 and influenza testing strategy at the study sites has yet to be fully understood, as healthcare-seeking behaviors, triage strategies and testing pathways have been adapted in many European countries. A good understanding of all the COVID-19 adaptations that DRIVE sites have implemented will be important to accurately describe the study population. Consequently, DRIVE is currently studying the feasibility of implementing COVID-19 surveillance elements in the DRIVE study platform.\n"," In the future, DRIVE proposes to leverage the COVID-19 experience during the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 seasons to design its proposal for a post-DRIVE study platform for influenza and other potential respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) by developing a proof of concept.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent pathogen involved, followed by other viruses such as rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, seasonal coronavirus, human bocavirus, (para) influenza, and adenovirus. 3 Every year, between September and March, pediatric hospitals in Italy note a large number of children affected by acute bronchiolitis. As with other infections, viruses that can cause bronchiolitis are transmitted through air droplets and aerosols and by direct or indirect contact with contaminated objects or surfaces. 2 As of December 2019, a new virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide, quickly resulting in a pandemic 4 and different personal protective equipment have been adopted in all hospitals to prevent its circulation. 5 SARS-CoV-2 causes severe bilateral pneumonia in adult patients, which often require hospitalization in the intensive care setting and can rapidly lead to death. Otherwise, children have a lower incidence of this infection and milder clinical manifestations than adults; this could be due to specific phenotypic and functional characteristics of their immune system. 6 However, recently, cases of severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) 7 and long-term coronavirus disease (COVID) effects were described in children. 8 Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, numerous sociosanitary measures have been adopted to reduce the spread of the virus: stay-at-home orders, social distancing, and nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as the use of face masks and hands hygiene. 9 These measures helped to contain the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 but have also influenced the transmission of other respiratory viruses. 9 The aim of this study was to describe the rate of acute bronchiolitis in children admitted to the pediatric emergency department (ED) since the beginning of the pandemic, comparing these data with those of 5 previous years.\n"," We conducted a retrospective analytical cross-sectional study in a University Third-Level Hospital in Rome (Italy) with annual attendance at the pediatric Emergency Department (ED) of about 15,000 patients from 1 month to 18 years of age.\n"," In our country, parents can bring their children to ED freely, without a referral from their pediatrician.\n"," Patients were identified from the electronic hospital's information system used in the ED (Gipse®) by searching for the keywords \"bronchiolitis\" and \"acute respiratory failure\" for all patients under 2 years admitted to the ED.\n"," We excluded children with mild upper airway infections (rhinitis and pharyngitis), children over 2 years of age with other respiratory infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia, and those with other infectious diseases (gastroenteritis, encephalitis, meningitis, otitis, mononucleosis, etc.).\n"," Data were collected by pediatric specialists and included some information from the enrolled patients, such as age, sex, triage color code, pediatric clinical history (prematurity and other comorbidities), and outcome.\n"," The triage color codes, assigned to the patients by the triage nurse basing on the child's general conditions, symptoms, and vital signs, were: \"red code\" for emergency care, \"yellow code\" for high priority care, and \"green code\" for low priority care.\n"," We analyzed data of all children with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis admitted to our Pediatric ED from the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, February 2020-February 2021. These data were subsequently compared with that observed in the same period in the previous 5 years.\n"," In the group of hospitalized patients, we also analyzed microbiological data, especially the polymerase chain reaction for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses on nasopharyngeal swabs.\n"," Board and Medical Ethics Committee of our institution. \n"," The number of admissions to the pediatric ED of our hospital in 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak, was 7.873 children, compared with a median of 13,488 per year in the previous 5 years. This corresponds to a reduction of 42% of the number of total visits to our pediatric ED.\n"," Analyzing specifically the cases of acute bronchiolitis managed by pediatricians in ED, we observed 33 cases in the COVID-19 period compared to 1045 in the previous 5 years, which corresponds to a reduction of 84% in the rate of bronchiolitis admitted to ED ( Figure 1 ). This is a very important observation, given that\n"," bronchiolitis is one of the main viral infectious diseases in childhood during the epidemic season.\n"," Afterward, we compared the demographic and clinical data of patients affected by acute bronchiolitis referred to our ED in 2020-2021 season versus 5 previous years.\n"," Among the 33 children with bronchiolitis admitted to ED during the COVID-19 outbreak, 24 (72.7%) were male and the median age was 4 months (IQR 2.5-7). When comparing the 2020-2021 season to 5 previous years no major differences were found with regard to gender, prematurity, other comorbidities, and age of admission ( \n"," During the COVID-19 outbreak, our data showed a significant reduction in the total number of ED consultations, according to the literature. [10] [11] [12] [13] This was due primarily to the recommendations imposed at the beginning of the pandemic to avoid access to ED, except in cases of real need, but also to the fear of being infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n"," In the months following the national lockdown, the rate of visits to the ED remained consistently low, but the most interesting fact concerned infectious diseases.

(1) found that 3 per cent of all colds were serologically related to 229E infection. This figure increased to 5 per cent if only the winter and spring seasons were considered. In a 6-year surveillance of 229E infections in young adults, Hamre and Beem (2) found 15 to 35 per cent of infections occurred during three seasons of \"high\" prevalence and 1 to 5 per cent in intervening seasons of \"low\" prevalence. Infection also occurred in a winter and spring seasonal pattern. Similar infection rates and seasonal distributions have been demonstrated in other adult populations (3) (4) (5) . Confirmation and extension of these studies to include groups of children have been limited (4, 5) .\n"," Assay procedures for 229E antibodies have not been entirely satisfactory. The complement fixation (CF) test has been used for serodiagnosis, but it is not recommended for serosurveys since 229E CF antibodies are relatively short-lived (4) . Neutralizing antibodies persist longer, but the examination of large numbers of sera by neutralization (NT) test in cell cultures is tedious (6) . In an earlier report (7) we described the development of an indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test for 229E antibodies. The test was shown to be sensitive SEROEPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY OF CORONAV1RUS 239 and specific, and the results closely parallel those obtained in the NT test.\n"," In this report we describe the application of the IHA test for a seroepidemiologic study of the role of 229E in infections occurring in a children's population over an 8-year period. The number and seasonal distribution of illnesses and infections, antibody prevalence, the relation of antibody to protection, and the clinical syndrome were studied.\n"," Study population. A longitudinal survey of respiratory illness was conducted from 1960 to 1968 in a church-sponsored children's home in the Atlanta area. This population has been described in detail in previous studies (8) . For each year-, the total number of children, median age, percentage of turnover, and the number and percentage of children from the original study group are shown in table 1.\n"," Collection of specimens. All children with any symptoms of respiratory illness were sent by housemothers to the Home clinic for examination by the attending physician who recorded all signs and symptoms on a standard form. Acute and convalescent blood specimens were collected 2 to 3 weeks apart. Control sera were collected from all children three times a year during the first 2 years of this study. At least twice yearly collections were made in succeeding years.\n"," Virus. The coronavirus strain 229E which had been originally isolated in human embryonic kidney cell culture and then passaged in WI-38 cells was used in this study (9) .\n"," Antigen production. The preparation of antigen for the IHA test has been described in detail elsewhere (7) . Briefly, RU-1 cells (diploid human fetal lung fibroblasts) were grown in 32-oz (960-ml) bottles with Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10 per cent fetal calf serum and aureomycin (25 Mg/100 ml) at 35 C. When monolayers were complete, two-wash cycles were performed with serum-free Eagle's MEM to reduce calf serum proteins. The cells were then inoculated with 229E, 20 ml of serum-free Eagle's MEM were added, and incubation was continued. When minimal cytopathic effect was detected, all but 2-3 ml of medium was decanted, and the cells were frozen at -70 C. The bottles were frozen and thawed three times, the contents were centrifuged lightly, and the supernatant fluid was collected and stored at -70 C.\n"," Antisera production.

In this study, sera were tested only for IHA antibody to coronavirus 229E. The CF test was not performed for 229E because of frequency of serum anti-complementary activity which was probably related to length of storage and previous usage.\n"," The IHA test has been previously described (7) . The test was performed on microtiter \"U\" plates. A 0.05 ml volume of 1:150 dilution of normal horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, was used as the diluent. Each test serum was titrated in 0.05-ml volumes in twofold dilutions beginning with a 1:10 dilution. Controls consisted of 1) the first four dilutions of each serum plus tannic acidtreated unsensitized erythrocytes, 2) sensitized erythrocytes plus diluent, and 3) 229E rabbit antiserum. The plates were shaken and permitted to stand for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature before erythrocyte-setting patterns were read. A fourfold or greater increase in antibody titer was considered to be indicative of infection. All sera were inactivated at 56 C for 30 min.\n"," Incidence of respiratory illness and seroresponse to coronavirus. Over the 8-year period 1477 respiratory illnesses were reported; 229E IHA sero-responses were demonstrated for 63. (None of the 63 illnesses could be related by isolation and/or seroresponse to any of the other respiratory disease agents included in previous studies.) An additional 105 sero-responses were detected by fourfold or greater increases in antibody titer between control bleedings. The total number of seroresponses was 168 (table 2) . A total of 112 was recorded for the years [1961] [1962] [1965] [1966] , and September through December 1968. Thirty-one of the 112 were associated with reported illnesses. The remainder (81) represented either unreported disease or subclinical infections. Fifty-six sero-responses were found throughout the other 5 years of the study. Of these, 32 occurred among children who reported respiratory illness. Included in the 168 seroresponses were 20 individuals who had two sero-responses during the 8-year surveillance period.\n"," Seasonal distribution. One hundred and ten sero-responses to 229E occurred during three outbreaks in the fall, winter, and spring quarters of the years 1961-1962 and 1965-1966 and from September to December 1968 (figure 1). Forty-eight sero- 1960-1961 1961-1962 1962-1963 1963-1964 1964-1965 1965-1966 1966-1967 1967-1968 1968 responses were found in the fall-winterspring quarters during years other than those previously mentioned. Only 10 seroresponses were found in the summer quarter during the entire study, but 6 of these were in children who reported illness. The 229E sero-responses which could be associated with illness accounted for 5 per cent of the total illnesses seen in the fall quarter, 4 per cent in the winter and spring quarters and 3 per cent in the summer quarter. Although the largest number of seroresponses occurred during the three outbreaks mentioned above, percentages for other years are worth noting. Strain 299E accounted for 9 per cent of the total respiratory illness in the winter quarters of 1963-1964 and 1966-1967 Evidence of preexisting antibody. Of 168 persons with sero-response in the population, 59 (35 per cent) had preexisting antibody titers of 10 or greater in two consecutive serum specimens collected before the rise in antibody titer (table 3) . Preexisting antibody was less frequent in the younger age group (5-9) than in the older age group (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Almost a third of the 10-to 14-year-old group, which had the highest number of sero-responses, had preexisting antibody. Thirteen of the 59 children with sero-responses to 229E had preexisting antibody titers of 20 or greater.\n"," Clinical syndrome. Clinical histories were available for 61 of the 63 children with reported respiratory illnesses (table 4). The major presenting complaints were sore throat (66 per cent), coryza (52 per cent), cough (43 per cent), and fever (21 per cent). The predominant physical findings were pharyngeal injection (82 per cent), coryza (64 per cent), fever >37.6 < 39 C (34 per cent), fever >39 C (8 per cent), and cervical adenitis (30 per cent).

DISCUSSION The development of the IHA test for 229E enabled us to conduct a seroepidemiologic study with a population previously investigated by the hemagglutination inhibition technique for evidence of coronavirus OC 43 infections (10) .\n"," IHA antibody sero-responses to coronavirus 229E accounted for 63 (4 per cent) of the 1477 respiratory illnesses reported. Twenty-nine of the 63 reported illnesses were found in three distinct outbreaks occurring in the fall, winter, and spring quarters of the years [1961] [1962] [1965] [1966] and the fall and winter of 1968. Another 80 sero-responses were found in children who were asymptomatic or did not report illness during these same periods. In this study, unlike previous studies, a large number of sero-responses were found during the fall quarters. In the fall of the year 1961-1962, for example, diagnostic 229E antibody rises were detected in 12 per cent of all the reported illnesses.\n"," The nature of the 229E outbreaks was cyclical and closely resembled that of the OC 43. Outbreaks of OC 43 were found in our previous study in the years 1960-1961, 1964-1965, and 1966-1967 . Major outbreaks of 229E occurred during the year 1961-1962, 1965-1966, and 1968 . Low numbers of 229E sero-responses were also found during periods of high OC 43 prevalence. This has been observed by others as well (1, 5) .\n"," In our study, the combined total of 229E (4 per cent) and OC 43 (3 per cent) infections accounted for 7 per cent of all illness reported over an 8-year period. This was higher than the 4 per cent found by Hendley et al. (1) over a comparable length of time. However, they found that OC 43 and 229E accounted for 8 per cent of all respiratory illness, if seasons other than spring and winter were excluded. The comparative ages of the populations under study could also have accounted for these differences in findings.\n"," The prevalence of 229E IHA antibody in the total population stayed relatively constant over the 8-year period. Previous studies have demonstrated the persistence of NT antibody to 229E, and a close relationship has been noted between IHA and NT antibody for 229E (7) or for other animal coronaviruses (11) . Despite the presence of such antibody, two infections with 229E occurred in 20 individuals during our study. Reinfection with coronaviruses had also been noted in previous studies (1, 10, 12) .\n"," Previous studies of experimental and natural infections with human and animal coronaviruses have revealed heterologous antibody responses (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . In our earlier study (7) of antibodies to 229E and OC 43 in human sera, simultaneous seroresponses were not found among 103 of 104 paired sera with a diagnostic antibody rise to either virus, despite the fact that over 30 per cent of these pairs had preexisting antibody to the other virus. Hendley et al.\n"," (1) also reported that antibody increases to either of these two coronaviruses were not accompanied by an increase in antibody to the other. Our observations apply only to 229E and OC 43. Heterotypic antibody rises caused by unknown or uncharacterized strains cannot be excluded. Our findings, as well as those of other investigators, must be interpreted with caution, particularly in view of the absence of isolation of etiologic agents responsible for tht illness, the lack of comparable serologic methods for assaying 229E and OC 43 antibodies, and the present knowledge of the serologic interrelationships of other possible human and animal coronaviruses.\n"," In previous clinical studies reported by Kapikian et al. (3) , the chief complaint of patients shedding 229E-like virus was coryza or nasal congestion followed by sneezing, sore throat, headache, cough, muscular aches, chills and fever in that order. Hendley et al. (1) found that illness due to 229E in adults was characterized mainly by nasal symptoms with little or no fever. They also found that illnesses due to OC 43 resembled colds caused by rhinoviruses and were characterized by pharyngitis, cough and nasal congestion. Our findings, based on patients with sero-response to 229E, indicate a close parallel in regard to nasal involvement. Our attending physicians saw more fever than that described by Hendley et al. (1) , although the frequency of fever with 229E was less than that described in our previous study with OC 43.

environments: a bibliometric analysis\n","Body Text: The evolution of learning and teaching methods from the traditional classroom learning environment to a technology-enhanced learning environment positively impacts education (Cárdenas-Robledo & Peña-Ayal, 2018; McIntosh, Herman, Sanford, McGraw, & Florence, 2004) . This transition is even more relevant nowadays due to unforeseen circumstances that create an emergency on the world's education, for example, where formal learning is not possible due to closure of schools as experienced in the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Atchison et al., 2020) . As a result of this pandemic and to prevent the spread of the disease, many countries adopted online distance learning as an alternative teaching model (Reimers & Schleicher, 2020) . This situation underscores the importance of developing a flexible, personalized, and adaptive learning environment to facilitate learning and teaching anytime, anywhere without physical contact and limited human interventions.\n"," Research has shown that smart learning environments (SLE) can provide a twentyfirst-century learning environment powered by advanced technology (Kim, Cho, & Lee, 2012; Laine & Joy, 2009) , pedagogy (Tomczyk et al., 2019) , and creative strategies (Harris, Dousay, Hall, Srinivasan, & Srinivasan, 2020) . Thus, SLE promises to provide the future learning ecosystem by leveraging advanced learner models and evolving new technology. Smart learning environments refers to ubiquitous, context-aware, personalized, and intelligent system capable of providing a high level of motivation, engagement, and intelligent feedback for a better learning experience (Agbo et al., 2019; Hwang, 2014) . The emerging field of smart learning environments began to gain scholars' attention in recent times. The increasing growth of the field creates the opportunity to investigate the smart learning environments trends in the literature and how its discussion among scholars has progressed. A comprehensive review of literature in smart learning environments is very important. First, it will provide overview of the progress made by scholars and their status. Second, it will reveal critical information that can guide researchers in making decision regarding areas to focus their future research (field hotspots); and which publication outlet is suitable for publication. To this end, this study examines the research landscape of the smart learning environment to gain a comprehensive understanding of the research activities from a multidisciplinary perspective, trends, and possible future direction of the field. Wang et al. (2020) recently conducted a related study that examined the research trend, status in the field of smart learning within China from 2012 to 2019. These authors, (Wang et al., 2020) were interested in knowing when research in smart learning began in China, its trend, and scholars' publication contributions. The problem with this paper is that it is limited to a country and date bound. While our study derives motivation from Wang et al. (2020) , it takes a different approach by conducting a comprehensive and all-encompassing study that is not limited to specific date ranges, regions, or countries. Besides, this study is focused on the science mapping of literature from the Scopus database by using the Bibliometric approach (Esfahani, Tavasoli, & Jabbarzadeh, 2019; Gilani, Salimi, Jouyandeh, Tavasoli, & Wong, 2019) . Science mapping technic with Bibliometrix R-package is a useful approach to performing the Bibliometric analysis of scientific publications (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017) . A bibliometric study has been acclaimed to provide a useful tool for analysing the evolution of discipline based on its intellectual contributions, social, and conceptual structure (Zupic & Čater, 2015) . Besides, many similar studies have applied bibliometric analysis to present an overview of specific field research. Among these studies, it is worthy of mentioning some recent and related areas such as research landscape of learning analytics (Waheed, Hassan, Aljohani, & Wasif, 2018) , augmented reality research (Arici, Yildirim, Caliklar, & Yilmaz, 2019) , multimedia learning research (Li, Antonenko, & Wang, 2019) , and research on classroom dialogue (Song et al., 2019) . These studies identified most outstanding publications, publication outlets, prolific scholars, research topics, and trends in the respective fields.\n"," This study aims to present a comprehensive review of the smart learning environment; hence, a bibliometric analysis is appropriate. To the best of our knowledge, no extensive bibliometric study of literature on smart learning environments has been conducted. This study is the first to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the field with a specific objective to examine the trend of smart learning environments over time; investigate the themes of smart learning in the publications; recognize prolific scholars and their contribution in the field of the smart learning environment; explore publication networks and collaborations across institutions, countries, and regions over time.\n"," Additionally, the study intends to identify any shift in the smart learning environment field's boundaries from a large body of information in extant research.\n"," The outcome of this study will provide useful knowledge for young scholars, mostly the young ones who are just starting to research in the field of smart learning environments. For example, young researchers can quickly identify top articles in terms of the number of citations, prolific authors, and research hotspots. Besides information such as trending topics and thematic future direction of smart learning environments can stimulate young researchers' decision in terms of research interest. The main research question that this study seeks to answer is: how research in the field of smart learning environments has progressed over the years in terms of scientific productions, thematic breakthroughs, scholars' contributions, and future thematic direction?\n"," In this study, a bibliometric mapping analysis was conducted. Bibliometric mapping is recently gaining more grounds in different disciplines (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017; Arici et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019) . Perhaps, the suitability of bibliometric for science mapping may have caused this extending acceptance among scholars (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017) . The entire procedure for conducting bibliometric mapping analysis in this study including data collection, screening, extraction, and synthesis are presented in this section.\n"," First, we commenced by conducting a document search on the Scopus database. The search string consists of a combination of compound keywords concatenated with the OR operator. The first search field contained the keywords \"smart learning environment\" to search \"All fields,\" while the second search field contained keywords such as adaptive, context*, personalized, and intelligent. These additional keywords in the second line of the search field were selected because they are mostly used to define the characteristic features of smart learning environments (Hwang, 2014) . Besides, these keywords have been associated with smart learning. For instance, Molina-Carmona and Villagr-Arnedo (2018) in their study entitled \"smart learning\", emphasized keywords such as \"personalized learning\", \"adaptive learning, situation or context-aware learning as key orchestrates smart learning environments. The initial query without any filtering returned 1212 document results. The search and retrieval of the data were conducted on June 19, 2020. These results were later filtered to exclude some irrelevant items based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in Table 1 .

The possibility of missing out on data from other databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, ERIC, etcetera could be minimal if a compatible formatting standard that allows for merging data generated from independent databases exists. Unfortunately, the bibliometrix R-package software 1 used in this study does not currently support this ambition. However, Scopus covers a large number of articles and provides higher records in terms of citations (Heradio et al., 2016; Shen & Ho, 2020) . Consequently, we claim that sufficient data to outline the scientific landscape, research hotspots, and other analysis conducted in this study was retrieved.\n"," In total, 1081 data were collected after refining based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria shown in Table 1 . These data were exported for analysis. Thanks to Scopus platform for allowing an export up to 2000 data at a time, unlike Web of Science (WoS), where a maximum of 500 data can be exported per time. Besides, Scopus also allows scholars to export data to different file formats such as BibTeX, CSV, Plain Text, RIS formats, etc. In this study, data were exported in BibTex format, which is allowable for importing into biblioshiny for bibliometrix tools (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017) .\n"," This study employed the use of bibliometrix R-package software, an open-source software that provides a set of tools for conducting quantitative research in bibliometrics. R-package was developed by Aria and Cuccurullo and written in the R language (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017) . It has the main algorithms for conducting statistical and science mapping analysis. The recent versions of bibliometrix R-package (i.e., 2.0 upwards) contains a web interface app (Biblioshiny) introduced to aid users without coding skills to conduct bibliometric analysis. Biblioshiny interface allows for data importing from Scopus or Web of Science databases in either BibTex, CSV, or Plain Text format. It is also possible to filter data in biblioshiny. Our study leveraged these opportunities inherent in biblioshiny for bibliometrix to import data from Scopus in BibTex format. The study analysis is presented in the result section.\n"," Table 2 presents the summary information of the dataset. For example, the table revealed the numbers of document types in the data collected. Conference papers (n= 497) are the highest number of the document type. Next is article papers (n=477), then book chapters (n=107). Other document types such as Notes, reviews, editorial, and short surveys accounted for the remaining 47.\n"," As used in this study, author's keywords (DE) refer to a specific list of keywords authors of a publication have listed (usually less than ten) to describe what their study dwelt upon as used in the full-text. In contrast, keyword plus (ID) refer to extended keywords and phrases generated by Scopus system, which consist of keywords from the references cited by authors of a publication (Tripathi, Kumar, Sonker, & Babbar, 2018) . In addition, authors per document refer to the mean number of authors per document, while co-author per document is the mean number of authors' appearances per document-both authors per document and co-author per document measure authors' collaboration.\n"," Results and discussion of findings are presented in this section to reflect (i) growth and trends of smart learning environment research in terms of publication output, distribution, source, and citations; (ii) prolific scholars, affiliations, and social networks; (iii) thematic focus of the field of smart learning environments.\n"," In this section, we begin by presenting the annual scientific production of articles in the field of smart learning environments.

Analysis from the bibliometrix R package shows that the field of smart learning environment has a 33.63% annual growth rate of scientific production from 2002 to mid-2020 (see Fig. 1 ). In 2015, 72 articles were recorded, which indicates the beginning of the impressive growth of publications in the field. This growth became drastic in 2016, where 138 articles were published. In 2019, 288 articles were published, which makes it the highest publication per year recorded so far. Since the field of smart learning environments is still emerging, it is expected, as revealed from the outcome of the analysis, that the scientific contribution would keep growing yearly. Regarding the number of citations of smart learning environment publications, Table 4 presents the average citation per year. This result shows the amount of influence the publication has on the field per year. The result shows that the only single publication in 2002, which appears to be the beginning of the field, received an average number of 3.1 citations. This implies that the authors'- (Sosteric & Hesemeier, 2002 )-work had a good impact in the field of smart learning environments. There was a dwindling of the number of citations between 2003 and 2009. However, the average citations per year grew to 10.2 in 2010, which is the highest citations recorded so far. Surprisingly, this number dropped sharply to 0.6 in 2011 and 0.7 in 2013. The reason for this fall in the citation in both years was not evident to authors; however, they can be considered as outliers. Besides, it can be seen from Table 3 that the annual scientific production in both years did not rise so much, which may have caused the decline in the annual citation for that year.\n"," In Fig. 2 Fig. 3 ) shows that \"Computers and Education\" is the most locally cited source with 1013 documents.\n"," Next, most locally cited source is the \"Smart Learning Environment\"-a fully open access journal initiated in 2014; published by Springer, and dedicated to providing opportunities for dialogue on the need for reform and innovative use of emerging technologies and pedagogy towards advancing learning and teaching in the twenty-first century (Spector, 2016) . The smart learning environment has a total of 622 documents based on the dataset. Closely following in the list of most local cited resources is \"Computers in Human Behaviour\", which has 613 documents. Regarding the relevant document recorded in the field of smart learning environments, this study investigated the global and local citation of publications. Global citation measures the number of citations a document has received from the entire database, in this case, the Scopus database. The global citation also measures the impact of a document, which in most cases, could receive its larger number of citations from other disciplines. On the other hand, local citation measures the number of citations a document has received from documents included in the analysed data. The local citation also measures the impact of a document in the analysed collections (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2020) . In other words, global citation considers citations from a global perspective in terms of disciplines, while local citation focuses only on citations within a discipline under study. Research has shown that aside from the scientific productivity counts, the number of citations for a publication also forms indices for ascertaining its significance and scholarly impact (Grant, Cottrell, Cluzeau, & Fawcett, 2000; Waheed et al., 2018) . To this end, the analysis shows that the most globally cited paper between 2002 and mid-2020 came from the article published by Baker, D'Mello, Rodrigo, and Graesser (2010) with total global citations of 400. This authors' work focused on the use of three different computer-based learning environments to teach students and, thereafter, investigated the incidence, persistence, and impact of their cognitiveaffective states (Baker et al., 2010) . In addition, the result shows 20 most cited documents from the study dataset (see Table 5 ). In the analysis, authors of Biblioshiny for Bibliometrix had written the algorithm to consider the local citation in order to determine the impact of documents within a dicipline. This study revealed that the work of received massive global citations failed to show up among the top 20 most locally cited documents based on the dataset analysed. Out of the 1081 data collected in this study, Baker et al. (2010) was ranked 22 in the list of most cited documents with a total number of local citations of 4 and a total number of global citations of 400. The discrepancy in the number of local and global citations cannot be unconnected to the widely focused nature of these authors' work-computerized learning environments-rather than the field of smart learning environments, which form a subset of their work.\n"," It is interesting to note also that a few studies in Table 5 received more local citations than global citations, as seen in the case of (Toivonen et al., 2018) and (Molina-Carmona & Villagr-Arnedo, 2018). One may think that the reverse should be the case. However, while authors cannot specifically give reasons for such a scenario, it might be the case of self-citations where these authors cited their study severally and published their works within the field of smart learning environments.\n"," The study also conducted an analysis of scientific production (i.e., amount of publications) and contribution to the field of smart learning environments across regions/ countries. The result demonstrates that the United States has the highest publication count from North America and closely followed by China from the Asia region. From Europe, the analysis shows that countries such as Spain, Germany, Greece, Finland, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, and the Czech Republic contribute substantively to the field of smart learning environments. Australia is actively contributing to the field of smart learning environments from their region. However, in the of Africa region, the result shows that a few countries such as South Africa, Tunisia, Nigeria, Morocco, Ghana, and Tanzania are making some contributions to the field smart learning environments. Further analysis shows the first 20 countries with total and average citations. The United States remains the top country, followed by China. However, surprisingly, Macedonia that seems invisible among the countries in terms of publication counts, became the third-ranked country in total citations and average citations of 188 and 62.7, respectively. This implies that although Macedonia may not have produced plenty of scientific articles in smart learning environments, the few published ones have a huge impact. Furthermore, as presented in Table 6 , Germany and Finland are also among the top countries whose contributions in the field have a significant influence.\n"," Results from the top twenty most prolific scholars in the field of smart learning environments from 2002 to June 2020 based on the dataset are presented in Fig. 4 . These scholars have shown consistency by contributing to the research body in this field. The result revealed that Arthur C. Graesser from the United States had produced a total of 12 documents and earned the highest citation counts of 618. He also has the highest hindex, which suggests that Graesser remains the most impactful author in the field of smart learning environments. Graesser's first article was published in 2007 with total citations per year of 4.6. Although our result shows that Graesser has no publication Fig. 4 . A more visualized representation of prolific scholars vis-à-vis their countries and specific area of interest in the field of smart learning environments is shown in Fig. 5 . This figure is a three-field plot of article contributions by countries, authors, and themes within the field of smart learning environments. The left-most column represents active countries, the middle column shows scholars' names contributing from those countries, and the rightmost column represents the most used keywords by authors. The number of occurrences of these keywords forms what we refer to as 'themes' in this study. Note the height of the boxes and the thickness of the connecting lines. On the side of countries, China has more authors' affiliations, with 120 authors connected to the country. Although our result revealed earlier that the United States is first in terms of scientific production and citation counts, they came second in authors' affiliation. In that order, Japan has the next higher volume of authors, followed by Fig. 5 A three-field plot of countries, authors, and themes of smart learning environments: The emphasis is placed on the height of each box and thickness of the connecting lines; the taller the box, the more significant; and the thicker the lines' correlation, the more information or volume of work was produced Tunisia and Canada. Observing the thickness of the line leading from the countries to authors, we can see that Ronghuai Huang and Gwo-Jen Hwang remains the giant contributors from China. Similarly, Arthur C. Graesser and Xiaoqiang Hu are the main authors contributing to the field of smart learning environments from the United States. In Japan, Hiroaki Ogata, Kousuke Mouri, and Noriko Uosaki remain the prolific writers.\n"," In addition, the aspect of learning analytic attracted more interest as the results show that 73 articles in learning analytics have emerged from authors such as Kinshuk, Hiroaki Ogata, and Kousuke Mouri, leading in that direction. Besides, the smart learning environment field also received interest and publications from Kinshuk and Ronghuai Huang as leading authors.\n"," Regarding institutions and authors' affiliations, contributing to the smart learning environment, the study investigated the publication output from the top 20 institutions. The result shows that Beijing Normal University, China tops with 37 documents. Next is the University of Memphis, in the United States, with a document count of 24. Athabasca University, Universidad De Los Andes, University of Hradec Kralove, the University of Twente, and Bradley University all belong to the top 20 institutions, with document numbers 22, 21, 20, 17, and 15, respectively (see Table 7 ).\n"," Regarding co-authorship and social collaboration analysis, the study explored the social structure component of the bibliometrix R-package (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017) provided in the biblioshiny user interface (UI). According to scholars, the social network of actors within a field delineates the relationship between two or more individuals, institutions, or countries with regards to collaborations (Prell, Hubacek, & Reed, 2009; Song et al., 2019) . These relationships are presented in a network where nodes represent actors, and links connecting the nodes represent the relationships. In this study, we present the collaboration network between authors, as shown in Fig. 6 , and the institution's collaboration network, as shown in Fig. 7 . The result shows that the big names already mentioned as prolific scholars in the field, such as Kinshuk, Huang, Graesser, Ogata, De Jong, and Aguilar are having a well-established collaboration network.\n"," Similarly, institutions such as Beijing Normal University in China and the University of Twente in the Netherlands are seen to have created a big network of collaborations with other universities. For example, the Beijing Normal University has Arizona State University, Athabasca University, University of North Texas, Hong Kong Institute of Education, and Hangzhou Normal University in its network of collaborations. However, a few other universities are shown to have little or no collaboration network. Although these institutions are actively contributing to the research field of smart learning environments, they have not established collaborations with other institutions to expand their social network in the field. For example, Central China Normal University in Fig. 6 Mapping of authors' collaboration network; Authors' names are written in the boxes; the bigger the box, the wider the author's collaboration network; also, there exist networks within a network, e.g., Fathi Essalmi and Mohamed Jemni all connected to Kinshuk China, the Graz University of Technology in Austria, the University of Eastern Finland in Finland, Bradley University in the United States, etcetera, are in isolation with no collaboration network.\n"," This section investigates the themes that dominate the research landscape of smart learning environments and areas that scholars have focused on over the years. Besides, the study also tries to gain insight into whether there is a shift in the topic of discussion among scholars within the field. We first began by analysing authors' keywords and their frequency of occurrences. Next, we carried out an analysis of keywords dynamics, trending topics, co-occurrence network, and thematic areas of the field.\n"," Keywords analysis, co-occurrence network, and trend topics Analysis of keywords used by authors in publications is an essential tool for investigating trending topics and scholars focus in the field (Song et al., 2019) . This analysis is so because publication keywords help to identify the topic and focus of that publication quickly. The word-cloud in Fig. 8 shows frequently used keywords in smart learning environments publications.\n"," Specifically, Fig. 9 is a visualized word dynamics of the authors' most used keywords. As shown in the figure, most of these keywords began to appear in the research landscape around 2010 and continued to grow afterward. While a few of them, such as Fig. 9 Authors' keywords dynamic view over time: it shows the growth of keywords; learning analytic has grown till 2018 and began to decline thereafter; however, higher education, personalized learning, internet of thing, and blockchain are keywords that show upward growth as of 2020 \"smart learning environment\" and \"smart learning environments,\" began to witness a rapid growth after 2011, learning analytics had a negative trend.\n"," However, learning analytics became one of the most used keywords from 2013 and grew very fast until 2018. This finding signified that learning analytics became the most discussed topic as an aspect of smart learning environments among scholars within those years. Notably, between 2018 and mid-2020, when this study was conducted, the use of these keywords began to nosedive. However, frequently used keywords such as higher education, online learning, smart education, adaptive learning, and personalized learning existed from around 2004 but began to rise after 2010. Between 2010 and 2020, keywords such as blockchain and internet of things emerged and continued to grow (see Fig. 9 ). This finding suggests that the field of smart learning environment will continue to be researched around these prevailing aspects.\n"," In addition, this study investigated the keywords co-occurrence network (KCN) in order to gain further insight into the trends in the field of smart learning environments. The KCN analysis presents the link between keywords in literature, which gives insight into the field's knowledge structure (Esfahani et al., 2019) . Therefore, our result shows that beyond identifying frequent keywords, as shown in the word-cloud (Fig. 8) , KCN revealed the connections between them (see Fig. 10 ). Notably, some keywords seem to have a greater impact on a network. For example, a close examination of these keywords from its color code suggests that a bigger keyword represented by their width are cohesively connected to other smaller keywords. For instance, Education connects to digital storytelling, blockchain, IoT, ICT, and learning. Similarly, a keyword smart Fig. 10 Co-occurrence network of keywords: the thicker line indicates a strong association between those keywords; thinner lines depict weak association, and keywords without connecting lines indicate that no relationship has been established learning environment is closely connected to adaptive learning and learning management system.\n"," Trending topics and thematic analysis of the field of smart learning environment Furthermore, an analysis of the trending topic based on the author's keywords from the dataset was conducted. While conducting the analysis, the following parameters were configured; timespan was set at 2011 to 2020, word minimum frequency was set to 5, number of words per year was set to 5, and word label size was also set to 5.\n"," Article keywords, which authors define, are usually connected to such publication content and are sufficient to derive topical aspects of a field (Song et al., 2019) . This analysis gives further insight into the trending topics in terms of keywords occurrences in smart learning literature over the years. Although many authors' keywords are shown in the word-cloud (Fig. 8) , the analysis in Fig. 11 presents the hierarchical arrangement of topics in smart learning environments discussed by scholars per year. These topics could relate to the field of smart learning environments in many ways. For instance, in 2016, inquiry learning was the most discussed topic, and it is a pedagogical domain of smart learning environments. Similarly, in 2017, smart learning was the leading topic, which is a key concept of smart learning environment; in 2018, learning analytics was top on the list, which also formed another critical domain of smart learning environment. The result also shows that as at the time of conducting this analysis, deep learning remains the trending topic in 2020.\n"," Another analysis conducted in this study is the thematic map of smart learning environments. The aim of conducting a thematic map is to gain insight into the field's current status and what its future sustainability holds. This analysis is useful in Fig. 11 Trending topics between 2011 to 2020 providing knowledge to researchers and stakeholders regarding the potentials of future research development of thematic areas within a field.\n"," The thematic analysis takes clusters of authors' keywords and their interconnections to obtain themes. These themes are characterized by properties (density and centrality). The density is represented in the vertical axis, while centrality takes the horizontal axis. Centrality is the degree of correlation among different topics; density measures the cohesiveness among the nodes (Esfahani et al., 2019) . These two properties measure whether certain topics are well developed or not, important or not. The higher the number of relations a node has with others in the thematic network, the higher the centrality and importance, and it lies within the essential position in the network. Similarly, cohesiveness among a node, which represents the density of a research field delineates its capability to develop and sustain itself. In Fig. 12 , we provide the thematic map of the field of a smart learning environment, which is basically divided into four quadrants (Q1 to Q4).\n"," The upper right quadrant (Q1) represents driving themes, the lower right quadrant (Q4) is underlying themes, the upper left quadrant (Q2) is the very specialized themes, and the lower left quadrant (Q3) is emerging or disappearing themes. Notably from the figure, a theme such as \"smart learning,\" sandwiched between Q1 and Q4, is well developed and capable of structuring the research field. In other words, smart learning remains the leading theme within the field. Themes such as \"education\" and \"e-learning\" seen in Q4 are the basics and are very important for the field's development. Themes in Q2 have developed internal bonds but still of marginal contribution to the development of the field of smart learning. This finding suggests that themes in Q2 such as storytelling, virtual reality, critical thinking, and serious games, are potential topics that Fig. 12 Thematic map: Q1 contains the main theme, Q2 contains highly developed and specialized themes building ties with the leading theme; Q3 contains disappearing or emerging themes; Q4 consists of foundational and transversal themes need to be more connected to smart learning. Scholars in this field may explore these pedagogical tools (storytelling and serious games) and technological approach (virtual reality) to provide smart learning environments for a twenty-first-century learning experience.\n"," The theme in Q3, \"learning analytic,\" appears to be emerging but transverses Q4, indicating that some of its components are basic and necessary for developing the field of smart learning environments. The thematic analysis suggests that more efforts are needed to develop themes such as \"digital storytelling\" and its associated components such as virtual reality, critical thinking, and serious games, to establish more ties with \"smart learning\". This effort is necessary because digital storytelling, an established field, can significantly contribute to the smart learning environment's structure, future, and sustainable development.\n"," This study has tried to provide an extensive review of scientific publications in the field of smart learning environment over time using bibliometric analysis. The study investigated the themes of smart learning in the publications; recognized prolific scholars and their contributions; explored social networks and collaborations across institutions, countries, and regions over time, and presented the thematic analysis of the field of smart learning environments by showing its current status regarding the themes, and future prospects. A total of 1081 documents were retrieved from the Scopus database for this study. This work makes a number of prominent contributions to the research body. First, the study revealed that the first paper on smart learning environments was published in 2002, which perhaps signifies the beginning of the field of the smart learning environment. Relevant publishing outlets were identified in this study. Foremost among the publishing sources as revealed by the study is the \"Computers & Education.\" This result provides an important guide to scholars regarding the publishing outlet that is suitable for their research papers.\n"," Additionally, an investigation into relevant articles published in the field revealed that the work of Kinshuk et al. (2016) stands out; these authors work mainly focused on the transformation of technology-enhanced learning into smart learning environments. Perhaps, their work sets the stage for discussions on the features and characteristics of smart learning environments from the technology and pedagogy perspectives. Similarly, our result delineates that the United States has the highest number of scientific productions in the field of smart learning environments over the years. That suggests that the United States remained the most relevant country in the field of smart learning environments. Regarding institutions' contributions and relevance, Beijing Normal University in China tops the list. In the aspect of prolific scholars making an immense contribution to the field of smart learning environments, Arthur C. Graesser from the United States tops the list with an h-index of 8. Besides, scholars such as Kinshuk, Graesser, Ogata, De Jong, and Aguilar have established a wide range of collaboration networks.\n"," Furthermore, the study revealed that the field of smart learning environments is recently evolving with the emerging and growing aspects such as \"learning analytics,\" \"adaptive learning,\" \"personalized learning,\" \"blockchain,\" and \"deep learning\". The thematic analysis results show that themes such as \"digital storytelling\" are emerging and connected to smart learning environments. However, this theme and its associated components, such as virtual reality, critical thinking, and serious games, needs to be further developed to establish more ties with \"smart learning\". The study further showed that in the mid-year of 2020, \"deep learning\" remains the trending topic. It is interesting to discover that between 2017 and 2020, newer topics connected to artificial intelligence (AI) such as learning analytics, blockchain, and deep learning, have emerged and grown to become research hotspots in smart learning environments. These findings underscore the importance of deepening further studies to leverage AI in future designs of smart learning environments. As part of our conclusion, some suggestions for future research in the field of smart learning environments are highlighted in this study.\n"," (1) It could be essential to develop more extensive research collaborations between scholars and institutions, thereby creating a more global impact on smart learning environments' potentials for an enhanced learning experience.\n"," (2) It is suggested that scholars invest more effort in learning analytics, machine learning, and deep learning, as the study shows that they are future research topics in smart learning environments. (3) More effort into researching digital storytelling, serious games, virtual reality, and critical thinking by educational technologists and designers of smart learning environments is suggested. This study has shown that there are potentials to adopt these strategies in developing twenty-first-century learning.\n"," This study has some limitations. Majorly, the study weakness is about the sample data collection. The study encountered a technical limitation in terms of the software used to conduct the analysis, where the merging of data from different databases was not possible at the time the study was conducted. The sample in this study was collected from the Scopus database, which may result in missing out relevant data. Collecting sample data from multiple independent databases would certainly improve the study in a significant way. In addition, the search keywords used in querying the database could be improved to consist more relevant keywords. This limitation should motivate future work where scholars could explore ways of collecting data from multiple databases with expanded keywords for a more in-depth analysis.\n"," In sum, we conclude that this study hopes its findings will provide insight to researchers, specifically, the young scholars in smart learning environments regarding the research landscape and future research hotspots. For example, young researchers who are beginning to research in the field can quickly identify top articles, prolific authors, and research hotspots in the field of smart learning environments. In addition, the study shows emerging topics in the field of smart learning environments, which needs to be further developed to connect to the objective of smart learning. Findings from this study provide a quick overview of the output in this field over the years and relevant pointer to the future direction in the field of smart learning environments. \n","Score: 1.7589060375361827\n","\n","Title: 158T: ROLE OF COMPUTER VISION IN SMART CITIES: APPLICATIONS AND RESEARCH CHALLENGES Application of region-based video surveillance in smart cities using deep learning\n","Body Text: Video surveillance is a key element for groundwork of a balanced smart city. Video data from all-over the smart city is collected from cameras acting as visual sensors. The collected visual data can be used to analyze objects and their characteristics from recorded scenes. There are several applications which helps to structure basic services of smart city such as smart traffic management and enhanced public security [5, 14] . These applications require uninterrupted streaming of salient visual data even when the bandwidth of transmitting network is low in capacity. For instance, in case of large-scale video analysis for tracking propose the suspected salient region (S-R) of vehicle, person or road is required in high quality for efficient video surveillance [14] . In order to ensure video transmission over limited bandwidth, video compression is mandatory where quality of salient regions is also guaranteed. In literature, a number of video encoding mechanisms have already been developed, e.g., video hashing and video compression algorithms [42] etc.\n"," Modern smart city surveillance cameras are equipped with video coding techniques such as High-efficiency video coding (H.265/HEVC) [40] developed by the ITU, and the visual coding expert group. The HEVC video compression is beneficial for reducing bit-rate, but the quality of the video is also affected [21] . Deep-learning (DL) techniques performed tremendously well in smart city surveillance applications such as remote monitoring [2] , transport management systems and road safety management systems [18] . Unlike image segmentation, a semantic segmentation is a process of allocating labels to each pixel of an image in such a way that the pixels with the same label belong to the same characteristics. Utilizing semantic segmentation for S-R extraction can be beneficial for multiple object identification that provides efficient video surveillance [29] . The advancements in smart city surveillance through video analysis not only increases road and traffic security, it also provides monitoring of street crimes. The state-of-the-art DL techniques for semantic segmentation are SegNet [3] , U-Net [43] , fully convolution network (FCN) [13] and deconvolution network [34] . These techniques can produce accurate semantic segmentation results but often consume high computational cost, high delays, and more time complexity due to the higher number of parameters and depth of layers. In this work we focus on proposing a shallow deep learning based segmentation network i.e. less in parameters, and can extract exact S-Rs without extra region. Moreover, another state of the art approach is proposed in [45] presented a deep learning based traffic video compression in which they are extracting region of interest by DL based localization method. They achieved prominent results for peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) however, they achieved higher bit-rate because of localization method which unnecessary extra region along with S-Rs.\n"," The main problem for high-efficiency smart city video surveillance encoding is to (1) extract salient-regions efficiently with low inference time. (2) Maintain a trade-off between visual quality and bitrate of the salient regions. Firstly, the existing DL-based S-R segmentation techniques are dense and requires high inference time. Therefore, there is a need of such DL-based network which can extracts salient-regions closer to human visual system with low computational cost and less inference time. Secondly, the video obtained by high-definition smart city surveillance cameras can only be transmitted over networks with higher bandwidths. Therefore, it is mandatory to reduce the video size to transmit it over low bandwidth networks. Traditional encoding techniques such as HEVC, can be used to reduce video size. However, these techniques cannot preserve high-quality of S-Rs while compressing the surveillance video that is why these techniques cannot be directly used for smart city surveillance. This paper presents an Efficient Shallow Segmentation based Encoding (ESSE) framework which ensures the high quality of salient regions in smart city surveillance video by reducing its size as well. It helps to identify suspected person/vehicle, detect traffic and roads. The scheme uses a less complex solution for deep learning based semantic segmentation. In ESSE, a shallow semantic approach is used for salient region segmentation as it requires fewer layers and parameters that reduces time complexity, which is suitable for surveillance. Moreover, we modified the HEVC encoding based on the extracted S-Rs which helped to reduce video size while preserving quality of salient regions from smart city surveillance video frames. The major contributions of this work are enumerated as follow:\n"," I. We explore the-state-of-the-art techniques by comparing existing tools and evaluating the salient region-based segmentation techniques and video encoding schemes to identify valid problem. We have also identified that the larger video size for highquality of S-Rs can interrupt the continuous stream of smart city surveillance video in emergency scenarios. II. A DL-based Shallow Semantic Segmentation Network (S-SSN) is proposed to extract the salient region from input surveillance video frames. The flow of CNN-based layered architecture and the role of the softmax layer is also modified. Although existing literature presents a lot of efforts towards semantic segmentation, to best of our knowledge use of the shallow approach for semantic segmentation in smart city surveillance scenario is not explored much. III. For efficient smart city surveillance, an efficient segmentation-based encoding framework is proposed and evaluated through case study in smart city environment. We have also performed extensive experiments on varied smart city surveillance videos such as, cross-road, banks, pedestrian in smart city.\n"," The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents the literature review for smart city surveillance, S-R segmentation techniques and S-R based HEVC encoding techniques. Section 3 offers the proposed ESSE framework with two phases. In Sect. 4, we discuss the case study results and other analysis. Section 5 concludes our work and provides a few related future research directions.\n"," This section explores the importance of video surveillance in smart cities, the existing schemes for efficient encoding and transmission of surveillance videos in smart cities and then deep learning based salient region segmentation techniques are also explored.\n"," Video surveillance of smart cities is an important part for development of balanced and secure environment. The first priority video surveillance is to get as much salient information as possible from the surveillance cameras in the shortest time. In [37] Ruben et al., carried out a survey on video surveillance systems current status and future trends. The main significant features and analytics are offered, and also the most general techniques for image/video quality enhancement for surveillance in smart cities. Nemours application of smart cities are included like smart surveillance for transport, social security, services etc. They also discuss most essential emerging deep learning techniques for smart city management and surveillance. Kashif et al., in [24] presented video surveillance for transportation in smart city environment. They have utilized a fuzzy approach to schedule traffic monitoring to avoid traffic congestions in smart cities. However, the authors only focused on traffic monitoring and ignores the pedestrian on roads. Traffic monitoring and guiding system presented in [32] where the authors did extensive study and presented survey for traffic management application in smart city environment. In [30] Saba et al., also opposed vehicular guidance systems based on wireless visual networks for smart city. The authors used graph theory to schedule traffic routes and finding specific locations on map. The proposed system by Saba et al., is efficient for finding shortest route though it is not intelligent enough to accommodate other objects rather than traffic. Another application of smart city surveillance is crowd monitoring presented in [28] where the authors proposed an intelligent computing based framework, the optimization algorithm is applied to compute the feature of crowd motion and measure the correlation between agents based motion model and the crowd data using extended Kalman filtering approach and KL-divergence technique. The experimental results are 96.20% for classifying. The above discussed state-ofthe-art studies highlights the need of visual surveillance in smart city environment for managing daily routine services.\n"," In this section, a collection of HEVC coding-based schemes are explored that highlight the S-Rs. HEVC based video coding is used in surveillance for city areas, such as presented in [11] . Kim et al., in [26] , was proposed fast CU based HEVC compression for the internetof-things environment and smart city surveillance. They presented an algorithm, which is based on neighboring block and depth information. In this work, time retention is used as an evaluation matric and achieved a 35% reduction in computational cost. A fast coding unit (CU) depth level selection method is proposed in [4] that can be enhanced along with rate-distortion by extracting regions of interest (RoIs) in smart city surveillance. For RoI selection, a software module is used for background extraction from moving images. The authors also presented a trade-off between PSNR and computational cost for bitrate by using the HEVC rate-distortion feature. In [31] , HEVC based rate control technique is explored, which was related smart city visual surveillance and smart video conferencing for better quality RoI encoding by leaving the rest of the image in low quality. In HEVC compression is implemented for moving object segmentation and classification methodology by incorporating HEVC. In this, features from HEVC encoded video were extracted and then used for classification and segmentation for the purpose of video surveillance. The achieved pixel accuracy was 80% for segmentation. RoI-based HEVC compression is presented in [27] , where a mechanism for video encoding on social media is proposed using HEVC. It involves a scheduler to select video to encode. They achieved 25% bit-rate reduction. The researchers presented RoI selection based technique by using super-pixel in [41] . They divided pixel regions of an image and assigned priority to the foreground and ignored the background. The achieved accuracy in terms of bit-rate and PSNR is high; however, the RoI extraction by using super-pixel cannot extract salient features semantically. Moreover, Xubien et al. [45] proposed a Perceptual-based Intra Coding Optimization (PICO) algorithm using deep convolution with HEVC. This method is identified that salient region extraction using DN is based on localization, which takes extra regions as well. Therefore, it demands more bit rate to transmit extra regions, that is unsuitable for surveillance.\n"," Our proposed scheme overcomes this issue by utilizing a semantic segmentation approach for salient-region extraction. Moreover, we have identified that applying DCN on classic VGG uses a dense approach with a large number of parameters. It increases computational cost, which is not suitable for the surveillance scenario. In the proposed approach, an improvement has been achieved by reducing both the number of parameters and network depth. The existing video encoding techniques reduces the resolution ratio of surveillance video, which also affects the performance of video analysis tasks, e.g., object/road localization, detection and recognition, vehicle tracking, and crowd monitoring [50] . Therefore, modified S-R based video encoding is more beneficial in video surveillance applications where the high video resolution is required [19] .\n"," This section reviews related techniques that use image segmentation to extract salient objects and their regions. Image segmentation is used to extract the S-R in surveillance video frames. The conventional ML image segmentation techniques can be used for salient region extraction. i.e., K-means [10] , Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) [15] , mean-shift and fuzzy c-means [17] . Hwang et al. [22] proposed multi-object detection and tracking, which focuses on the segmentation of road objects such as vehicles and pedestrians. For deployment, a 3D-lidar is used for sensing the targeted objects on road images, and DBSCAN is utilized to segment those objects for tracking and detection. The achieved pixel-accuracy of segmentation is 67-96% with different time intervals and 3D-lidar frequencies. A pedestrian segmentation and detection scheme using mean-shift segmentation [31] focus on unmanned Ariel vehicles by using a locally collected dataset from surveillance cameras. This scheme was tested on available datasets and achieved pixel-accuracy of 76% calculated by (1) where, t i is the total number of pixels belonging to class I , and p ii represents the number of true positives. Above discussed ML-based segmentation techniques have low time complexity; however, they are sensitive to noise and require pre-processed data such as pixel intensity information and extracted edges in images. These computer vision and ML state-of-the-art algorithms have constraints in their ability to segment natural images with respect to the object classification. The input dataset with many levels of abstraction can also involve major manual-tuning for all images explicitly.\n"," The state-of-the-art DL techniques for semantic segmentation include SegNet [3] , U-Net [36] , fully convolution network (FCN) [39] and deconvolution network [34] . These techniques can produce accurate semantic segmentation results but often consume high computational cost, high delays, and more time complexity due to the higher number of parameters and depth of layers. SegNet, U-Net, deconvolution network comprises of 26, 23, and 39 convolutional layers. These DL-based networks have a higher number of parameters which delays the inference that may affect the performance of a video surveillance encoding system. In [38] Cristiano et al., presented a region of interest (RoI) based video encoding for video conferencing application. They have used viola and jones [47] algorithm to determinate the RoIs and propose a rate control scheme that allows using large\n"," bitrates in RoIs to achieve high image quality in such areas and imposes bitrate limitations in the remaining regions. DL consists of ample techniques, which automatically learn features from raw input data itself. DL-based image segmentation is referred as semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is the process of associating each pixel of an image to a selected output class label, i.e., building, roads, trees, cars, etc. Pixel-accuracy of semantic segmentation is formulated as explicit labeling of each pixel where Xi ∈ R3 all three channels of an image corresponding to a label Yi from a static set Ψ. For N number of observations, X = {X 1 ,…,X N }a set of labels Y = {Y 1 ,…,Y N } is predicted taking values in Ψ N . Pixel-level accuracy is used as evaluation matrix for semantic segmentation. Accordingly, these evaluation matrices use a confusion matrix C of pixel level, which sums inferences for all the images of dataset as given in (2) [27].\n"," In Eq. (2), SIgt (Z) is the ground truth of pixel Z in I image, SIps is the predicted class based on labels, and |A| carries the elements of the set A. In detail, the Cij is the total numbers of pixels belongs to ground truth label i predicted as j. Some of the popular deep convolutional semantic segmentation networks based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are discussed below. In [41] , a FCN for semantic segmentation based on VGGNet [50] , GoogleNet [19] and ResNet [10] is presented. The FCN combines features by using fully convolutional layers and achieved 89.19% of accuracy, and 62.3% mean intersection over union (mean IoU) on PASCAL VOC [15] dataset. However, the FCN computational cost is high due to the fully connected layers. Undoubtedly, methods like the above have been in use to solve various issues, such as to enhance visual quality. Their performance is based on the attention mechanism, that prominent texture regions might attract more attention than sparse texture regions. Moreover, they can be used for special needs and improve the visual experience. However, most of these algorithms are based on texture or color-features to identify the salient regions from an image. Saliency extraction based on deep learning is rarely explored, which is closer to the human perception system and also suitable for a surveillance scenario. a brief review of state-of-the-art techniques are listed in Table 1 3 Proposed efficient shallow segmentation-based encoding framework for smart city surveillance\n"," This section presents the Efficient Shallow Segmentation-based Encoding (ESSE) framework for smart city video surveillance of vehicular traffic, roads and human beings. It demands a high quality semantic segmentation technique to extract the salient regions like humans and vehicles where video size is also reduced to ensure uninterrupted transmission of surveillance video especially for emergency scenarios. For bulk video analysis the data should be light weight to prevent storage and quality issue. In this work, we present a framework for video efficient surveillance video transmission for targeted visual analysis based on salient video encoding which helps to attain high quality for targeted salient region with low file size. The proposed framework could help to segment salient region such as humans and vehicles of each type from video frame and transmit in low bandwidth capacity. The proposed framework can help in intelligent transport management, street crime, and road hazards. The proposed framework is divided into two phases as shown in Fig. 1 . In Phase I, the salient region (S-R) is segmented from the input video frames by using our proposed Shallow Semantic Segmentation Network (S-SSN) which is trained using Mapillary vistas dataset divided into training data (18,000 images) and testing data (2000 images). For training the parameters are set such as batch_size = 6 , number_of _epoch = 75 , number_of _classes = 5 . The S-R is extracted for each frame of input surveillance video. We identified that the existing state-of-the-art DL-based techniques involve a dense layer pattern which requires more computational cost, processing time and less accuracy. We have designed and evaluated a large number of layer patterns and finally the proposed model named S-SSN is proved to be the best suitable with less computational cost and better accuracy. Proposed model includes less number of layers, therefore, we call it a shallow network instead of dense. Existing approaches including U-net, DN and SegNet are dense with more number of parameters and less accuracy and mIoU. These are not suitable for visual analysis for time critical emergency system like road surveillance.\n"," In phase II, the extracted frames are preprocessed to generate a set of the salient map (SM) for each S-R per frame. Next, the SM is further utilized to create QP maps for all extracted N frames. Furthermore, a set of QP maps is also maintained for all N frames. Meanwhile, YUV frames are also created from the original input video. Next, the modified HEVC encoder takes each QP map from the set to enhance the QP values of each YUV frame. In this case, we modified the default HEVC by considering the QP values to sustain the quality for salient regions like the vehicles and pedestrians in the frame. We reduce the quality of irrelevant areas by increasing QP values that result in reducing the overall size of the video. Modified HEVC encoder generates the encoded video bit-stream with a reduced size that requires less bandwidth. It enables the continuous the remote monitoring of ambulance through surveillance camera and the video can be transmitted even when bandwidth is low. This proposed scheme can facilitate remote visual analysis by providing high quality for S-Rs to analyze the data at cloud. It also reduces the video size that enhances the chances of uninterrupted video sharing even if bandwidth is limited. A list of notations is presented in Table 2 .\n"," The proposed S-SSN is a DL-based segmentation network that is based on a shallow semantic approach. In the approach, a shallow architecture is used for the segmentation network instead of dense architecture. This is because shallow architecture has less time complexity due to fewer parameters, and therefore, it suits surveillance scenarios. The S-SSN semantically extracts those classes which are important for road surveillance, i.e., vehicles, motorbike, pedestrian, and roads. The dataset used during training and testing phase of proposed S-SSN is open-source Mapillary Vistas and Camvid, which is considered to be a benchmark [8] . It comprises of 18,000 training and 2000 validation images. It contains 66 instance-specific object categories. It covers all North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania geographic locations. It contains high weather variations, i.e., sunny, rainy, snowing, fog, and haze. It has been captured during different times like dawn, daylight, dusk, and night. Different camera sensors are used to capture this dataset, which varies in focal length, aspect ratio, and camera noises. For the dataset, a variety of capturing viewpoints have been used, like capturing from the road, sidewalks, and off-road. Our selected experimental dataset covers major variations of the environment to ensure robust S-R segmentation. The dataset also includes extra-ordinary weather and environment variations. The S-SSN is trained on the Mapillary vistas and Camvid benchmark road dataset separately with a ratio of 80% for training, and 20% is for testing. After training, the S-SSN collects a set of feature weights and uses them for prediction in testing phase. Figure 1 illustrates that video frames are extracted from surveillance video and then fed into S-SSN layered architecture for salient region extraction. We also improved the order of layers for up-sampling and down-sampling to improve efficiency of this module. During down-sampling, the layers L 1 -L 9 from left to right take the frame as input and then down-sample it. During up-sampling, layers start from L10-L17, where the output image of size 28 × 28 × 256 from down-sampling is fed into the network as input. The input image is upsampled by using the convolution layer, which comprises of 256, 128, and 64 filters of size 5 × 5. The up-sampling and normalization layers return an image of size 224 × 224 × 5, where the 224 × 224 is height and width of image and 5 are the number of classes for segmented salient regions, i.e., vehicle, pedestrian, road, bicycle/bike, and the background. In the end, S-SSN uses a softmax layer that calculates the probability of each class in contrast to all possible numbers of classes. The S-SSN generated an extracted salient region frame for N number of frames, i.e. {frame 1 , frame 2 , … , frame N } . In the overall process, S-SSN takes an input video stream vid input having n frames such that vid input = 1 , 2 , … , n where each frame is a three-channel image with height h and width w such that: n ∈ [0;4] h×w×3 , the objective is to learn a function f that produces multi-class masks ∈ [0;4] h×w×3 for ground-truth or salient region S − R gt where r represents the row, and c represents the column of label as given in (3). S-SSN involves the CNN layers, including convolution layers, max-pooling layers, upsampling layers, ReLU, and batch-normalization. All layers are stacked to calculate activation function at th hidden-layer of the network at kth stage as given in (4) where a ( −1) represents the input to the layer, ( ) and ⌊ ( ) are weights and biases of the th layer, respectively. The semantic segmentation network involves three components, including polling, up-sampling, and softmax. The pooling and up-sampling of the features are expressed in (4) and (5) at every stage l ( ) :\n"," The softmax stacks these layers in a particular order, as expressed in (6) . In this scenario, each pixel of the input has given a representative class calculated on the ground of softmax, where k represents the down-sampling stage, and l represents the up-sampling stage.\n"," In Phase-II, we created SM to generate QP maps. These maps are further used for video encoding using HEVC, which is discussed in the following sub-sections. \n"," The frames with extracted salient regions are preprocessed to enhance the visibility and area around S-R. Next, a for each S-R is generated using distance transform [7] . In Algorithm 1 for SM creation, a set of video frames with extracted S-R are used as input.\n"," Step 1 takes the first frame for initialization, and step 2 sets a count for all number of frames to N. In step 3, an array is set for SM, and step 4 iterates frames until it lasts whereas step 5 iterate N numbers of frames.\n"," Step 6 is to apply forward pass on the extracted frame. In step 7, iterations are applied for rows where row index r ranges from {2, 3, …, m − 1}, and m represents rows count in a frame.\n"," Step 8 explores the iterations for the number of columns where column index c ranges from {2, 3, …, n − 1}, and n is the number of columns in the frame. In step 9, the forward pass is calculated by moving diagonally on the extracted frame where wn and wd are diagonal weights in neighbors which are used to calculate distance from each pixel location of the frame. During backward pass on the video frame, step 13 shows iterative repetition in reverse order for rows index r ranging from {m − 1, m − 2, …, 2}. Similarly, column index c is iterated in a reverse manner ranging from {n − 1, n − 2, …, 2}, as shown in step 14. In step 15, the backward pass moves diagonally in backward direction to calculate the distance of each pixel from its location by using wn and wd . Next, SM is created for each extracted frame, as illustrated in step 18.\n"," SM is used to create a QP map, which is further utilized to adjust the quality of S-Rs and non-SRs. The set of SM creates a set of QP maps for N frames. QP maps {QM 1 , QM 2 , … , QM N } corresponds to {fn 1 , fn 2 , … , fn N }. For an evaluation scenario, a surveillance video is converted into YUV format to feed as input in modified HEVC with S-R based QP map. After that, the modified HEVC encodes the surveillance video by using S-R based QP map to reduce the quality of non-SRs and enhance the quality of the desired region like vehicles, roads, and motorbikes. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , an S-R based QP-map is created from video by identifying S-Rs and SM. For row r in frame do 8.\n"," For column c in frame 9. fr (r,c) = min ((fr(r-1,c-l \n"," For each column c in fr 15 .\n"," We have utilized default HEVC reference test model HM 16 [20] for modifications. In the default HEVC, the entire frame is encoded to reduce its size and quality, but it also results in reducing the quality of S-Rs. We have enhanced the functionality of default HEVC by incorporating S-Rs based quality adjustment during encoding. QP maps play a vital role in enhancing the quality of S-Rs, including roads and vehicles, but reducing the quality of background to reduce overall video size. The modified HEVC uses the QP map based on S-R locations instead of using default predicted QP values. HEVC involves 2-D transforms [44] , scaling and quantization [46] module. It takes a QP map as input and also takes the input video. The output of this module is fed into context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) that generates encoded bit-stream as shown in Fig. 2 . HEVC divides video frames into equal coding tree units (CTUs), which are equally sized blocks. The range of CTU size varies from 16 × 16 to 64 × 64 with two chroma (Cb and Cr), one luma (Y), and coding tree blocks. Modified HEVC receives input YUV video and corresponding QP maps to perform salient region-based quality control. This encoded video is transmitted towards users who can decode it. In this scenario, CTUs in high priority S-Rs are encoded using low QP values and vice versa. The outcome of S-SSN segmentation and modified HEVC is presented in Fig. 2 , where SM and QP map are generated on the basis of prioritized S-R like vehicles, pedestrians, and motorbikes. In this scenario, the base QP value is 20 for S-Rs with good quality and 51 for non-SRs to blur its background region by preserving saliency along with reduction in video size.\n"," This Section explores the performance of the implemented ESSE scheme as compared to its counterparts. For the experimental setup, the Adadelta optimizer is used for training the proposed S-SSN with default parameters by using Keras and Tensorflow python libraries. All experiments are performed on the Google Colab platform with Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU having 11 GB VRAM and 12 Gb of RAM [25] . HEVC reference test model HM 16 [16] is used. For encoding the surveillance video frames as per the generated salient-map, the default available HEVC test model is used. For a fair comparison, we have established the same experimental setup for other state-of-the-art deep learning based techniques. We focused on four classes including pedestrians, vehicles, motorbike/bicycle, and road. To evaluate the performance of proposed ESSE framework more extensive experiments are conducted and the results are evaluated for bit-rate, peak signal to noise ratio, number of parameters for segmentation networks, mean intersection over union (Mean IoU), pixel accuracy, PSNR db, and bit-rate percentage. We video encoding comparison we have compared ESSE framework with PICO [46] that applies deep learning by using two test video sequences \"PeopleOnRoad\" and \"Traffic\" from JCT-VC [6] in Fig. 3a , b. Next, we compared with the state-of-the-art segmentation methods, including SegNet [43] , U-Net [13] , and deconvolution network (DN) [45] in Fig. 4a -e. Furthermore, Fig. 5a -d presents visual results of segmentation for DL based segmentation networks. The comparison of different environments video sequences such ad Main-road [12] , Cross-road [23], Bank [49] , and Dash-cam [33] is presented in Fig. 6a, b. \n"," It is quite essential to measure the bit-rate due to reduction in the size of encoded video to evaluate the surveillance video on low bandwidth networks. We use the same evaluation matrices as in [45] by considering full-frame and S-R as well. We use three quantization settings where the QP value ranges displayed in Table 3 where 0-20 is for high-quality video encoding, 25-35 for medium quality, and 40-51 for low quality. During the experiment, the same regions of frames are utilized. value of bit-rate, Bjontegaard delta bit-rate (BDBR) [6] is used. The rate-distortion (RD) curves of proposed S-R encoding and default HEVC encoding is utilized to calculate BDBR. ESSE attained a BDBR decrease of 56.92%, 52.03%, and 25.87% for high-quality, medium quality, and low-quality settings for QP values, respectively. Furthermore, Fig. 3a show that bit-rate reduction for video sequences like \"Peo-pleOnRoad\" and traffic scenario is 3.38% and 4.4% for PICO [45] , respectively. For the same sequence, proposed ESSE dominates by reducing the bit-rate by 56.51% and 47.49%, respectively. The difference of obtained values for bitrate is calculated as shown in (7) [45] . Results show that the proposed solution has a trade-off between bandwidth resources and visual quality of S-R in smart city surveillance videos to achieve better bit-rates.\n"," We calculated the PSNR value of the complete frame to analyze a fair comparison of ESSE framework with default HEVC. The average PSNR value of default HEVC for the complete frame is higher than ESSE since the proposed ESSE focuses on preserving the S-R while maintaining the low bit-rate by assigning higher QP values to the regions which are non-S-Rs. Therefore, the proposed ESSE achieved the higher PSNR value. The results from Table 4 presents a comparison of PSNR for full-frame and S-R as well in case of default HEVC and proposed ESSE framework. In the case of S-R with a baseline QP value of 20, ESSE achieved the PSNR of 49.77 dB with a bit-rate of 2552.19 kb/s, whereas default HEVC obtains 49.61 dB with low bit-rate of 5939.27 kb/s. In the case of full-frame comparison, ESSE achieves 47.95 dB whereas default HEVC obtains 42.17 dB. Moreover, the proposed ESSE is compared with state-of-the-art deep learning-based PICO [45] by utilizing two test video sequences \"PeopleOnRoad\" and \"Traffic\" from JCT-VC [8] . We make a fair comparison between perceptual based HEVC or PICO [45] and proposed ESSE with modified HEVC. We first processed the two video sequences with ESSE and then calculated the difference of obtained values for PSNR by using the Eq. (8) from [45] . To quantify the gain in the visual quality of the surveillance video, we have utilized the Bjontegaard delta peak signal-to-noise ratio (BD-PSNR) [6] . It is observed that BD-PSNR is improved by 5.35 dB, 4.23 dB and 1.18 dB for high, medium, and low-quality settings for QP values. [16] , bank [25] , main road [1] and dash-cam [9] , respectively. For the same video sequences, the proposed ESSE achieved the PSNR as 45.18 db, 46.95 db, 46.62 db and 44.89 db, respectively. The achieved PSNR value of ESSE and Default HEVC is almost same which shows that the proposed ESSE framework achieve same quality video as HEVC but ESSE achieves better quality for salient regions with lower bit-rates. Figure 3b represents the gain in PSNR in db. For same experimental conditions the proposed ESSE framework achieved 0.49 db gain in PSNR for PeopleOnRoad and 0.28 db gain for \"Traffic\" video sequence whereas PICO [45] obtained 0.47 db and 0.24 db, respectively.\n"," A quantitative measure is to check the accuracy of S-R segmentation and compare it with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks, including SegNet [3] , U-Net [36] , and DN [34] . Pixel-level accuracy evaluates percentage for correctly segmented pixels calculated as ∑ i p ii ∕ ∑ i t i . The term p ii represents the number of true positives, t i represents the number of pixels, i belongs to class i and p cl shows the total number of classes. The p ij depicts the pixels from class i which are predicted and belongs to class j, whereas p ji is the wrongly rejected number of pixels for class i. The mean IoU [39] is the percentage of correctly overlapped pixels between the ground truth label and segmented output calculated Figure 4c presents pixel-level validation accuracy for Camvid dataset of 96%, whereas for the same experimental settings, the U-Net, DN, and SegNet achieved 77%, 77%, 90%, respectively. It also explores that proposed S-SSN achieved the highest mean pixel level validation accuracy of 92% as compared to 77%, 86%, and 87 for U-Net, DN, and Seg-Net, respectively for Mapillary vistas dataset. Figure 4d illustrates the pixel-level training accuracy for Mapillary vistas and Camvid datasets for comparative state-of-the-art segmentation networks. Results show that the proposed S-SSN model predicts the S-Rs from Camvid dataset with pixel-level training accuracy of 99% whereas for the same experimental settings, the U-Net, DN, and SegNet achieved 73%, 71%, 83%, respectively. It also explores that proposed S-SSN achieved the highest training accuracy of 98% as compared to 74%, 85%, and 76%for U-Net, DN, and SegNet, respectively for Mapillary vistas dataset. Furthermore, Fig. 4e illustrates time consumed for training of S-SSN and other compared state-of-the-art techniques. The S-SSN consumed 1563 s whereas the U-Net, SegNet, and DN consumed 1475 s, 1607 s and 1456 s. The above mentioned comparative results are calculated after deep analysis. It can be observed from the above graphs that the proposed S-SSN is best suitable for road surveillance scenarios in terms of validation accuracy, mIoU, time and number of parameters. Figure 5 shows the visual segmented result as compared to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks. Figure 5a represents the original frame from the surveillance video sequence [12] , whereas Fig. 5b shows segmented results of the proposed S-SSN model. Figure 5c and d shows results of segmentation by SegNet and DN. Results demonstrate that S-SSN achieves significant segmentation results for S-R and is a better S-R extractor for surveillance videos as it requires fewer computations due to the shallow approach as compared to counterparts. Figure 6a elucidates the pixel-level accuracy percentage when results are obtained for four video sequences. Results show that simple S-SSN segmentation, and S-SSN segmentation with modified HEVC achieve 92.31%, 90.02%, 89.18%, 91.2% pixel accuracy for cross-road [16] , dash-cam [9] , bank [25] and main road [1] video sequence, respectively. Values for S-SSN segmentation and S-SSN with modified HEVC are same because it shows that pixels with S-SSN segmentation sustain higher pixel accuracy even after performing modified HEVC encoding. On the contrary, the default HEVC encoding reduces the pixel accuracy as 86.78%, 85.17%, 82.11%, and 86.1% for the same video sequences with same S-SSN as well. Figure 6b illustrates Mean IoU as 79.31%, 76.78%, 69.05%, 78.06% for S-SSN segmentation, and S-SSN with modified HEVC for cross-road [16] , dash-cam [9] , bank [25] and main road [1] video sequences.\n"," This Section presents case study test scenarios results for our proposed ESSE framework for smart city video surveillance on baseline QP of 20 for S-Rs. We have conducted extensive experiments in different environments and luminance conditions for vehicles, pedestrians, motorbike and bicycles to evaluate the performance of our proposed ESSE framework. Case studies are as follow:\n"," In first case study we conducted the experiments for pedestrian in smart city environment. For testing our proposed framework, we have conducted experiments for three different scenarios for pedestrian. We have utilized testing sequence [12] for scenario 1 where pedestrian and camera both are in dynamic moving positions. Figure 7 shows the results for all three scenarios. In Fig. 7a , scenario 1 presents original extracted frame. Figure 7b scenario 1 presents the encoding results of default HEVC whereas Fig. 7c Figure 7c shows the results of our proposed ESSE framework for scenario 3 with PSNR value of 29.71 db. The default HEVC results for all three scenario depicts that all the pixels of entire frame are compressed regardless of saliency. Due to which the visual analysis of compressed frame is not possible as the salient features of all pedestrian are lost. On the contrary, from the result of ESSE it can be observed that the surveillance frame encoding is dynamic and the saliency features of pedestrian are preserved in high quality which can be further utilized for visual analysis. \n"," In second case study the experiments are performed for multiple scenario of vehicles on roads in smart city environment. For testing purpose we have utilized testing sequence [9] for static front view camera as fist scenario where a camera is fixed on road side and captures passing by cars. Figure 8a scenario 1 illustrates original extracted frame. The encoding results of default HEVC is depicted from Fig. 8b scenario 1. Figure 8c The second scenario of case study 2 is aerial view static camera [23] . The original extracted frame of scenario 2 is presented in Fig. 8a scenario 2. Figure 8b scenario 2 represents encoding result of default HEVC and Fig. 8c scenario 2 shows the ESSE framework encoding results. The achieved PSNR value of default HEVC is 32.20 db whereas the proposed ESSE achieved higher PSNR value of 31.16 db.\n"," The third scenario of case 2 is moving dash board camera [12] . The results are illustrated in Fig. 8a , scenario 3 which shows original extracted frame where all the vehicles i.e., car, bus, truck are moving on road. The default HEVC and proposed ESSE encoding results are presented in Fig. 8b and c compressed frame is challenging as the salient features of vehicles are lost during compression. Furthermore, the proposed ESSE framework result shows that it is able to efficiently extract and encode video frames while maintaining the visual quality of salient features of vehicles.\n"," The third case study is conducted for different motorbikes and bicycle in smart city environment. The video sequences of static camera [23] is taken for case 3 scenario 1 where camera is static and the multiple bicyclists are in dynamic moving positions. Figure 9 shows the results for all third case study scenarios. In Fig. 9a scenario 1 presents original extracted frame of bicyclists. Figure 9b scenario 1 presents the encoding results of default HEVC whereas Fig. 9c scenario 1 shows results for proposed ESSE framework. For scenario 1 the achieved PSNR value of default HEVC is 31.40 db and for proposed ESSE is 33.4 db.\n"," The second scenario of third case study is a moving camera [12] where the bicyclist and the camera both are in moving position road. Figure 9a Figure 9b , c illustrates encoding results of default HEVC and proposed ESSE with achieved PSNR of 28.71 and 30.05 db respectively. As previously discussed results of case 1 and case 2 the results of default HEVC are also similar for case 3 i.e., all the pixels of complete frame are compressed regardless of salient features. Due to which the visual analysis of compressed frame is not possible as the salient features are lost. On the other hand, the results of proposed ESSE framework where the encoding of surveillance video frame is dynamic and the salient features of motorbike and bicycles are preserved in high quality which can be further utilized for visual analysis.\n"," We have evaluated the proposed ESSE framework in term of Pixel accuracy (training and validation), number of parameters, mIoU, bit-rate and PSNR. We have compared the proposed S-SSN with deep learning based state of the art techniques such as Segnet, U-Net and DN which are trained on two different benchmark datasets CamVid and Mapillary vistas for five different classes i.e., pedestrian, vehicle, road, cyclist and motorcyclist. The result elucidates from Figs. 4 and 5 that the proposed S-SSN achieved significant results in terms of mIoU, Pixel accuracy (training and validation) and number of parameters compared with all other techniques.\n"," The overall performance of proposed ESSE framework is also compared with state of the art techniques i.e., perceptual based HEVC and default HEVC. The results are explained in Figs. 2, 3 and Tables 3, 4 depicts that the proposed ESSE performed better and achieved higher PSNR in contrast with low bit-rate. Furthermore, to examine the efficacy of proposed ESSE we have conducted real-time experiments based on case study scenarios. We have considered three environment conditions (1) Ariel view of people on roads, moving camera with people indoor and on footpath with fixed camera. (2) Vehicles captured with fixed camera, Ariel view of vehicles and vehicles captures with moving camera. (3) Cyclists captured by fixed camera, cyclist captured by moving camera and motorcyclist with camera in hand. The case study results demonstrate that the proposed ESSE framework is affective and applicable in numerous environment conditions.\n"," In a smart city surveillance scenario, the visual data collected through camera is required to be transmitted in high visual quality for analysis. The transmission of high quality visual data is a challenging task on low capacity bandwidth communication channels. To address this issue, we have proposed a surveillance framework ESSE, that integrates deep learning based salient-region (S-R) extraction and efficient video encoding. The ESSE is presented in two phases. In Phase-I, a shallow-semantic segmentation network (S-SSN) is proposed to extract S-Rs and validated for two benchmark datasets. The phase-II generates S-R based salient map, which helps to create a QP map for saliency-based HEVC encoding. The proposed S-SSN achieved pixel-level validation accuracy of 96% and 92% for CamVid and Mapillary vistas datasets respectively. The efficacy of proposed ESSE is also evaluated by conducting extensive smart city surveillance case study for diverse road conditions. The detail results of case study analysis are presented in subsection (4.1-4.4) of result and analysis. The major finding of ESSE framework is the capability of extracting S-Rs and transmitting them in high quality while maintain low bit-rate. Therefore, the proposed solution has a wide applicability for areas having low bandwidth resources. The limitation of this proposed solution is that the training phase of ESSE framework is based on supervised learning. In future, we shall consider the DL semantic segmentation method based on un-supervised learning for Multi-View HEVC [33] to detect the crowded areas to timely ensure social distancing at large scale to avoid massive spread of Covid-19. Moreover, our scheme is efficient for the road scenario but the sensitive data sharing demands to guard against security issues where block-chain may be considered in future to provide dependable solution.\n","Score: 1.5565145738383444\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proofs A metagenomic-based method to study hospital air dust resistome A metagenomic-based method to study hospital air dust resistome\n","Body Text: Antibiotics were invented for preventing bacterial infections and saving lives [1] .\n"," However, as a symbol of the defense mechanisms that bacteria have evolved over time, the genes that make bacteria resist antibiotics are overwhelmingly present in the environment after extensive antibiotic applications worldwide [2, 3] . Not only are waterborne and soil-related resistant bacteria threatening our health, but bacterial ARGs in the air are a serious concern. Some research groups have examined ARGs from the outdoor air, and those resistances seemed to be closely related to air quality parameters. For instance, Li et al. [4] showed PM 2.5 possessed a high concentration of ARG against β-lactam, quinolone, macrolide, tetracycline, sulfonamide, aminoglycoside, and vancomycin in China. Xie et al. also noticed seasonal ARG variations across industrial-urban-rural areas on an annual basis [5] .\n"," Humans are closely tethered to the indoor environment. From the hospital we are born in to the homes and offices we live in and work in, the indoor environments have become the most intimate ecosystem for humans. Lax et al. studied many aspect related to indoor micro-ecology [6] [7] [8] . They revealed human microbiota can influence indoor microbial communities and also be shaped by a built-in environment.\n"," Micro-ecology associated with hospital settings arguably has the most profound implications because hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) have always been considered as one of the main causes of patient deaths [7] . Therefore, lots of effort has been focused on determining how microorganisms colonize, persist, and change in the hospital's indoor environment. Many previous studies have identified dominant hospital-associated pathogens (HAPs) and summarized their putative routes of transmissions. Those starting routes mainly include physicians' and staff's clothing [9] [10] [11] , stethoscopes [12] , phones [13] [14] [15] [16] , keyboards [17] , and even patient bedrails [8] . In any case, little is known about the possible indoor air ARG and/or pathogen transmission route.\n"," In this study, a metagenomic-based method was applied to provide insights regarding possible ARG transmission in hospital indoor air. Meanwhile, bacterial cultivation, PCR, qPCR, and Nanopore sequencing approaches were also applied to provide support to our analyses. Overall, findings in this work support the notion that 1) the Outpatient hall is one of the main ARG transmission sources, and it can affect other departments under different airflow conditions; 2) management practice should focus on bacterial genera such as Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus; 3) plasmid-mediated ARG transfer can occur frequently among departments.\n"," Two sampling rounds were performed in summer (Aug. 2018) and winter (Jan. hours after sampling. Notably, we were asked to collect the strainers before the cleaning experts rinsed them periodically (usually thoroughly cleaned after 1 to 2 months usage). After the strainers were received at our lab, the dirt on them was shaken and washed off into sterilized autoclavable containers using sterilized ddH 2 O. Thereafter, the nonsoluble and dissolved dirt samples were all filtered immediately using 0.22 μm filters (Millipore, USA). The filtrated membranes were then transferred to purple-capped tubes in a FastDNA kit (MP Biomedicals, USA) and stored at -20 °C before downstream DNA extractions were performed (see Figure S1 for an overall schematic overview). Besides the air dust samples, we also surveyed water, door handle and lobby chair surface swabs as internal sample comparisons in the studied hospital (refer to addendum in SI).\n"," Portions of soluble air dust samples were used for colony counts. Six types of antibiotic LB agar plates (each has only one antibiotic of ampicillin, chloromycetin, meropenem, kanamycin, tetracycline or erythromycin) were used to screen for antibiotic resistant bacteria (see Table S1 ). All agar plates were prepared within one week before use and incubated at 37 °C overnight with the potential for re-incubation up to 48 h. Bacterial isolates were then selected for genome sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT). A whole genome DNA extraction method (Easy-DNA kit, Thermal Fisher, USA) was applied to those bacteria following manufacture instructions. We also applied a FastDNA spin kit (MP Biomedicals, USA) on filter membranes following the operational instructions. Quality controls were incorporated in both cultivations and extractions to monitor for operational errors.\n"," The universal 16S rRNA (27F and 1492R) primer pair was used to identify bacterial cells (Table S2 ) [18] . We used Premix Taq reagents (TaKaRa Taq V2 plus dye, Dalian, China) to perform PCR reactions with a BioRad T100 Thermal Cycler.\n"," The 25 μl reaction contained 12.5 μl premix Taq reagent, 1 μl (10 μm) forward primer, 1 μl (10 μm) reverse primer, 1 μl DNA template and 9.5 μl water. 30 cycles of 94 °C 30 sec, 60 °C 30 sec, and 72 °C 1.5 min were used for all amplifications.\n"," Meanwhile, a total of seven qPCR assays that target antibiotic resistance and integron genes were applied. We directly used the published primers from previous studies and the seven assays included blaNDM [19] , intI1 [20] , qnrA [19] , sul2 [19] , vanA [21] and tetW [22] . The qPCR reactions were performed by Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The reaction contained 5 μl 2 X PCR mixture with 1 μl forward primer (10 μm), 1 μl reverse primer (10 μm) and 1 μl DNA template in a total of 10 μl volume (2 μl water). We Both the Illumina and ONT sequencing technologies were used in this study. We used Illumina HiseqXten-PE150 platform to perform metagenomics sequencing (Novogene, Nanjing, China). Each department was designated to have at least two samples (one sample per season, but there were two replicates in M2 and P2, respectively). The sequencing library size was 350 bp and 10 G raw data was initially aimed for. For bacterial whole genome sequencing, the extracted genomic DNAs were purified by AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, USA) following the instructions (gel electrophoresis was also checked), then the intact genomic DNA samples were gently and evenly mixed. Rapid Barcoding Sequencing (SQK-RBK004) was used for the library preparation following the manufacture instructions. Finally, GridION X5 platform was used to initiate Nanopore sequencing on R9.4 flowcell for 48 hours.\n"," We applied FastQC (v0.11.8) for metagenomic data quality checks. In brief, O1 had a \"sequence duplication\" error, and M2 had a \"per sequence GC content\" issue (floppy at the first 6 reads). Those two issues were addressed by the BBmap programs dedup.sh and bbduk2.sh, respectively before downstream analyses. We testified the reproducibility of our sequencing methodology using two replicates in M2 and P2.\n"," Notably, only one replicate from M2 and P2 samples were used for the subsequent read analysis (see details below). In this study, metagenomic analyses were based on reads and metagenome-assemblies, respectively. The following four subsections focused on read analyses, and the last subsection dealt with assembly analyses.\n"," The rapid characterization and quantification of ARGs were analyzed by ARGs-OAP v2.0, which was developed by Yin et al [23] . Briefly, both 16S and ARG type/subtype information were extracted from metagenomic reads at first. Then, the ARG profiling was calculated by normalizing the extracted ARG sequences against reads that mapped to 16S rRNA gene. Both ARG type and subtype (equivalent to genotype) results were summarized in supplementary file 1.\n"," MetaPhlAn2 was used to compute the composition of microbial communities at species-level resolution [24] . Since MetaPhlAn2 can generate species-level resolution, we searched the pathogen species in the microbial community profile to generate a pathogen list (supplementary file 2). The community profiling results can be visualized in Figure S2 . We also applied HUMAnN2 to summarize microbial pathways using the UniRef90 and ChocoPhlAn databases with default protocols [25] , and the results are available in supplementary file 3.\n"," In this study, we used SortMeRNA (version 2.1b) [26] to extract 16S rRNA sequences from metagenomic reads. The silva-bac-16s-id90.fasta database was used with --fastx --paired_in --aligned output --log -a 8 parameter settings. Extracted 16S rRNA sequences were then analyzed by vsearch (version 2.8.0) [27] to generate operational taxonomic units (OTU) tables for all tested samples (identity cutoff=0.97). OTUs were then analyzed by alpha_diversity.py program in QIIME (1.9.1) [28] to calculate Good's coverage and Shannon index values (Table S3 ).\n"," In this study, we focused on two types of source tracking analyses using SourceTracker [29] . Since patients, doctors, and visitors all start their routines at M, we assume it can serve as a \"source\" in our Bayesian algorithm, leaving other departments as a \"sink\". Each OTU table was firstly sorted based on abundances, and then commonly shared information was extracted and reorganized into matrix format for all samples (supplementary file 2). Besides OTU source tracking, we also took ARG genotype profiling results in source tracking analyses ( Figure 2 ).\n"," We assembled metagenomic sequencing reads separately (clustered by departments). All assembly processes were performed using CLC Genomics Workbench 12 (Qiagen Bioinformatics, USA). The program was run by default setting with minor changes: 1) the minimum contig length was set to 500 bp instead of 200 bp; 2) length fraction (mapping process) was set to 0.8. After M, O, and P metagenome-assemblies were obtained using de novo assembly method, open read frames (ORFs) in each assembly were predicted by MetaGeneMark [30] . Diamond [31] was then applied to search these ORFs against RefSeq protein (Jul. 2017) database (E=10 -5 ). The blast format output of Diamond was parsed by MEGAN5 [32] for taxonomic assignment. Then assembled contigs were taxonomically classified to a Kingdom if more than 50% of the genes within a contig were attributed to the same Kingdom. The same threshold was used for Phylum and Class level taxonomies, while 40% was applied for order, followed by 34% for family, 30% for genus, and 25% for species [33] [34] [35] . Taxonomic annotations generated from this homology-based method were served to identify the phylogenetic affiliation of ARG carrying bacteria. BlastP [36] was used to search ORFs against SARG database with similarity cutoff of 80% and alignment length cutoff of 70% to identify ARGs from these metagenome-assemblies. Genus level carrier with two seasonal sequencing read partition results (normalized after mapping reads back to contigs) [37] were summarized in Figure 4 and supplementary file 5. In this study, The PlasFlow.py program was used to predict the existence of plasmids in all metagenome-assemblies [38] . To increase result accuracy, we changed the --threshold probability parameter to 0.9 (0.7 by default). The assemblies were then subdivided into chromosomal and plasmid contigs, and the plasmid contigs were used for further genotype sharing network analyses.\n"," We selected 11 cultural isolates for Nanopore sequencing but only 9 isolates were found to have plasmids (see Table S4 ). Briefly, the selected bacterial colony was firstly enriched in LB broth, and then after cell precipitation by centrifuge, whole genome DNA extraction was performed. Each bacterial species was determined by Sanger sequencing before Nanopore sequencing. The Nanopore sequencing fast5 files that passed QC were basecalled with albacore [39] . Next, Porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) was used to trim adapters. The resulted fasta files were assembled by Canu 1.8 [40] . Since we performed Sanger sequencing, the estimated -genomeSize option in Canu was correctly imported for correction, trim, and assemble steps. A recently published plasmid database PLSDB [41] was used to search for plasmid-like DNA fragments (>99% similarity and 6000 bp in length for successfully assembled contigs or >2000 bp for Nanopore raw reads). ResFinder 2.1 [42] was used to identify ARGs from Nanopore reads (90% similarity and 60% alignment cutoff). The detailed results were summarized in Table S4 & S5.\n"," Spearman's correlation tests were performed using the cor function in base-R (3.5) to confirm the reproducibility between replicates. We checked the community and ARG correlations, respectively on all replicates ( Figure S3 ). Meanwhile, to compare air dust samples, we performed an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM, R package \"vegan\" [43] ) using the shared bacterial OTU matrix. Procrustes analysis was performed to illustrate the correlation between resistome and community profiling [44] . In brief, the Procrustes transformation significance was calculated by measuring An ARG genotype sharing network was constructed to search for plasmid-mediated ARG transfer. First, two-round metagenomic sequencing results were clustered (normalized results that were generated from MetaPhlAn2 and ARGs-OAP v2.0).\n"," Second, only ARG hits with similarity greater than 0.99 were considered. Third, identified plasmids were used to clarify the possible ARG transfer among hospital departments. Forth, the plasmid-like fragments identified from Nanopore sequencing were also integrated to confirm plasmid movements ( Figure 3 ). The ARG carriers' networks were shown in Figure 4 and Figure S4 , and we also networked the ARGs that were identified by Nanopore isolate sequencing regarding shared ARG genotypes and plasmid-like fragments information ( Figure S5 and S6). All network graphs were created using Gephi 0.9.2 and draw.io software.\n"," The quality of all post-QC clean reads was high (Q30 over 93% for all samples).\n"," The metagenomics datasets had 162 Gbp post-QC clean reads, meaning each air dust sample had over 20 Gbp high-quality data on average (see Table S6 ). In this study, two replicates from winter sampling, namely P2 and M2, were used for reproducibility analyses, and the non-parametric Spearman's tests showed the correlations ranged from 0.77 to 0.93 (r-value) regarding OTU and ARGs, respectively ( Figure S3 ). The reproducibility results indicate that our metagenomic sequencing results are reliable. After CLC de novo assembly, P had 1347130 assembled contigs (at least 500 bp in length), followed by M (607008 contigs) and O (240311 contigs). N50 contig measurements (including scaffolded region) from O, P and M were 791 (max 162632), 1118 (max 1287280) and 1733 (max 120352) bp in length, respectively. From rRNA α diversity results, we can see summer sampling had higher Good's coverage but lower Shannon index's values, suggesting the diversity of summer air dust samples is lower than winter air dust samples.\n"," All bacterial isolation negative controls exhibited no bacteria growth and the positive controls showed antibiotics functioned properly in this study. From Table S1, we can see that the resistome were present in P1, P2 and O1, and 5 out of 6 antibiotic types were detected (no ampicillin). Meanwhile, PCR showed all air dust samples were bacterial positives but all the extraction controls were negative, indicating our DNA extraction step is contamination free (see Table S2 ). Both cultivation and PCR showed that the resistome were prevalent in air dust at this hospital. Our findings suggest antibiotic resistant airborne bacteria could freely move in the hospital air and accumulate in the air-conditioner, which was also consistent with others' results [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . For qPCR assays, we only obtained positive results from intI1 and tetW. One explanation might be we have only applied correct candidate primers for those two assays since both intI1 and tetW primers used here were previously applied in hospital settings. Therefore, our results indicated that the selection of hospital ARG primers was necessary in our case since ARG genotypes varied greatly [23] . The standard curves (intI1 and tetW) have higher R 2 values (>0.983), and the amplification efficiencies varied from 1.18 to 1.23 (see supplementary file 4). The lowest limit of detection (LOD) value is 10 4 gene copies/reaction. The qPCR enumerations showed intI1 exhibited 5.95 log 10 copies/reaction (on average), and the average tetW concentration was 6.14 log 10 copies/reaction. Metagenomic sequencing only generated short reads and required computational resources to reconstruct the \"broken\" genomic fragments. Therefore, inconsistencies between cultural and metagenomic sequencing are unavoidable [50] . In this study, we noticed there are inconsistencies among culture, PCR technologies, and metagenomic sequencing, indicating different methods have different sensitivity and specificity abilities to some degree. But the throughput advantage is outstanding for the metagenomic sequencing approach. Notably, both qPCR and metagenomic results detected tetW, but ARG carrier analysis missed its presence, suggesting there are also disadvantages when using metagenomic sequencing (e.g., sequencing coverage, depth and PCR bias issues, etc.).\n"," From ARGs-OAP v2.0 data analyses of 1208 total ARG subtypes, P1 had 167 hits followed by 144 in M1 and only 42 in O1 (see supplementary file 1). However, P2 had 384 hits followed by O2 and M2 with 357 and 344, respectively. Meanwhile, similar findings were noticed using α diversity and network analyses ( Figure S4 ).\n"," Moreover, after we grouped ARG subtype detections, 86 occurred in winter but only according to a study that was performed in central Taiwan [51] . Another consistency proof was that a group of researchers from Iran found the hospital indoor air was a potential route of transmission of beta-lactam resistant Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus [47] . Even though ANOSIM showed no significant differences among all air dust samples (p = 0.67), the Procrustes analysis could help us separate the air dust resistome samples. In Figure 1A , we can see a dispersed scattering in summer (enclosed-space) but a more tightly clustered shape in winter (natural ventilation), indicating there might be distinct bacterial community and resistome characteristics under different airflow conditions. Additionally, from the PCoA analysis ( Figure 1B) , we noticed hospital air dust ARG compositions were closely related to human activities.\n"," The MetaPhlAn2 microbial community results can be seen in Figure S2 . We can see that most of the species were bacteria, but we also detected polyomavirus, and porcine type-C oncovirus. Some of the bacteria were closely associated with humans.\n"," For instance, Streptococcus sanguinis and Rothia dentocariosa are known from the human mouth [52, 53] . Some studies related Acinetobacter johnsonii, Pseudomonas stutzeri and Acinetobacter junii to clinical settings [54, 55] , and Aerococcus viridans, Enhydrobacter aerosaccus, and Micrococcus luteus were thought to be related to air dust [56] . Therefore, our results showed the hospital air-conditioner accumulated a variety of human-related bacteria that can be \"detached\" from humans in some way.\n"," For instance, a microbiologist recently demonstrates the importance of wearing masks to protect health under COVID-19 pandemic [57] . The results showed that speaking, coughing and sneezing could produce tremendous bacteria associated droplets in short time, indicating the likelihood of indoor human exposure to bacterial pollution is high.\n"," Another evidence was reported by Kennedy et al. [46] , which they directly sampled exhaled aerosols from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and healthy volunteers. The results showed blaTEM was detected on face mask surfaces from both patients and healthy persons; therefore, the authors concluded that patient-generated aerosols may cause antimicrobial resistance dissemination. This \"detachment\" might be endangering human health in hospital indoor environment since many pathogens were detected in our study (see supplementary file 2). Notably, another longitudinal analysis of microbial interaction between humans and home indoor environment showed that a new house could be rapidly converged by occupants' microbial communities, indicating that the hospital indoor environment exhibits high health risk if occupied by contagious patients [6] . From HUMAnN2 results, a clear aerobic lifestyle was observed in M air dust community for both summer and winter. It is interesting to observe some prevalent anaerobic pathways (such as sulfate reduction, homolactic fermentation, and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide) in P1, implying that a non-negligible anaerobic bacterial growth happens in air dust. But this anaerobic metabolic pathway disappeared in wintertime, which might explain α diversity results.\n"," Our metagenomic data analyses demonstrated that 1) the hospital air dust samples have a variety of ARG carriers and 2) airflow conditions seem to play roles in distributing and accumulating resistome in air dust samples.\n"," As can be seen from Bayesian source tracking results (Figure 2 ), P2 still harbored summer bacterial species, and the overall impact of M increased greatly from summer (around 20%) to winter (around 50%). A similar trend was also observed regarding ARG source tracking. For instance, more than 80% of winter ARGs from both P and O could be explained by M. Such a huge impact on the overall air dust resistome from M2 indicated heavy resistome exchanges could occur in this hospital frequently. This observation was also following the Procrustes analysis. Notably, Lax et al. claimed that under natural ventilation conditions (e.g., wintertime in our case), a significant reduction of the pathogenic percentage of airborne bacteria can be found [8] .\n"," Since we noticed the frequent exchanges, it is necessary to search for the possible media that can initiate ARG transfer. Thus, we constructed an evidence-based ARG genotype sharing network (Figure 3 ). Unlike statistical association networks [58] , we focused on an evidence-based strategy to establish network edges. Meanwhile, strict cutoffs were applied (e.g., only genotypes with over 99% similarity to a known genotype can be used). As can be seen, the Outpatient hall had the largest number of shared ARG genotypes, and Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Streptococcus, and plasmid-mediated ARG transfer may be highly possible. Nanopore sequencing helped us successfully assemble 5 bacterial genomes, and some of the long reads were classified into plasmid category (BLASTn against PLSDB, in Figure S6 ), suggesting there are active plasmid-related activities. As shown in Table S4 , tetracycline, aminoglycoside, macrolide, and β-lactam were all detected from these live cells, and the movement of Staphylococcus saprophyticus plasmid among departments might be important for ARG and HAP transfer patterns in this hospital.\n"," Prior studies either applied amplicon sequencing to identify aerosolized microbial communities [8] or used PCR based methods to profile resistome [59] . Some studies applied metagenomic approaches on aerosolized microbial communities in hospitals, but they did not connect ARGs with specific carriers [60, 61] . In this study, we integrated a state-of-the-art metagenomic method to link ARGs to specific bacteria and we also confirmed the ARG transfer using cultural isolate whole genome Nanopore sequencing. Even though whole study plan worked (from wet lab to data interpretation), we speculated that our survey (two-time points) only demonstrated limited ARG profiling and transfer information, meaning multiple survey years and more sampling frequencies (e.g. weekly or monthly) are needed. Additionally, Illumina sequencing still suffers from fragmented assembly and needs more turnaround time. The short-read sequencing methods were not able to address repetitive insertion sequences, which is often not avoidable in antibiotic resistence gene regions [62, 63] . On the other hand, the Nanopore technology has a short turnaround time and much longer sequence read, which can favor studying the structure and genomic context of resistance genes. Therefore, even if Nanopore sequencing has higher sequencing error problems, we still propose to develop Nanopore metagenomic sequencing methods that are suitable in the context of hospital settings in the future.\n"," We show that the studied hospital air dust samples exhibit complex resistome, and the average concentration is higher than in some other environment (e.g., drinking water, wastewater effluent, and ocean). As a \"hotspot\", hospital air-conditioners can accumulate resistome and pathogens overtime, indicating hospital indoor air could serve as one of the transmission routes for bacteria. Figure 1A is Procrustes superimposition plot that depicts the confident correlation between air dust resistome (Bray-Curtis) and community compositions (Bray-Curtis); Figure 1B is principal coordinate analysis based on ARG subtypes of various environmental samples: CFA represents chicken farm air, HWA is hospital winter air dust, HSA is hospital summer air dust; STP represents sewage treatment plant.

Vertical ellipse within each oval represents ARG genera that were identified with their relative abundances in summer (yellow) and winter (blue, shown as a bar chart). Circle-pairs represent ARG genotypes. Genotypes are linked to the carriers as network edges. The size of the circle is proportional to its abundance (normalized against 16S rRNA gene) within air dust samples. Circle border represents the mobile mechanisms: plasmid carrying (dotted line) and chromosome encoding (full line). ARG genotypes shared among departments are shown in the middle area outside oval and each sharing instance was further linked with dash lines; those plasmids (red) and chromosomal (green) are shown as different colors. Those sharing instances are confirmed by whole-genome Nanopore sequencing (->o----o<-). Figure 4 Network of ARG genus carriers among different departments within the studied hospital. The grey node size is proportional to the total relative abundance (in term of ppm) of ARG carriers.

The associated actions are demonstrably useful in supporting the principles and offer teams interested in virtual external implementation facilitation concrete methods by which to ensure success. Our examples stem from experiences in healthcare.

Practical principles are plan in advance, communicate in real-time, build relationships, engage participants, and construct a virtual room.\n"," We give examples of how to enact practical principles to promote success.\n"," Facilitation is considered a \"core ingredient\" for successful implementation of evidence-based practices and innovations in complex clinical programs [1] . A facilitation implementation strategy comprises a role (facilitator) and a multi-faceted set of actions (interactive problemsolving and provision of interpersonal support) with individuals, groups, and organizations to enable adoption of innovations into routine practice in the context of a quality improvement (QI) process or implementation study [2] . Facilitation aims to create a supportive environment that enables facilitators and innovation stakeholders to exchange knowledge, identify barriers to implementation, and develop processes to overcome those barriers [3] . Because implementation facilitation relies on continuous relationship-and skill-building, it usually involves a blend of in-person and virtual interactions [4] .\n"," External facilitation refers specifically to the role individuals outside an organization have in helping those within the organization implement evidence-based interventions into routine practice. External facilitation has multiple purposes: identifying and resolving problems, communicating, and building and supporting the relationship between the organization and the researchers [5] . Identifying and resolving problems can involve, among other things, identifying barriers, sharing viable solutions and options, helping set realistic goals, and providing networks of peer sites. Communicating may mean providing regular contact and information, monitoring data and possible solutions for problems, and establishing links among sites. And relationship building and support includes providing reassurance, encouragement, empowerment, and mentorship.\n"," Virtual external implementation facilitation is important for implementation studies and programs. Virtual interactions may expand the public health impact of successful interventions [6] by enabling a wider reach than in-person only interactions. Studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, support the potentially greater reach of fully virtual programs [7, 8] . Emergent public health situations may also necessitate transition from in-person to virtual interactions. The COVID-19 pandemic and consequent implementation of social distancing guidelines forced many educational endeavors, laboratories, and non-COVID-19 research efforts either to quickly transition to remote interactions or else temporarily halt their activities [9] [10] [11] . Under these conditions, virtual facilitation offered opportunities for teams to remain connected, adapt their plans, and continue their work [12, 13] . In-person facilitation also frequently requires resources (personnel, time) that may be cost-prohibitive. Compared to in-person interactions, virtual team engagement involves fewer travel-related costs, enables more flexible scheduling, may result in greater likelihood of stakeholder attendance and fewer disruptions to clinical responsibilities, and can enhance tracking and archiving of facilitation activities [14] . Taken together, these reasons offer a compelling case for external facilitation implementation to proactively consider how best to leverage advances in teleconferencing and videoconferencing technology.\n"," Our team has extensive experience in virtual external implementation facilitation. In 2017, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care created a national QI program for VA's 134 nursing homes (Community Living Centers, CLCs). The CLCs' Ongoing National Center for Enhancing Resources and Training (CONCERT) supports CLCs in implementing evidence-based practices for QI [15] . CONCERT, guided by the principles of relational coordination and person-centered care [16] [17] [18] , aids CLCs in shifting from a quality assurance approach (focusing on remedial actions and retrospective data) to one of high-involvement performance improvement (all staff and managers involved in a prospective, preventative, evidence-based approach to care). Since 2018, CONCERT has held successful 6-to 9-month long learning collaboratives to help CLCs implement evidence-based practices.\n"," We conducted these collaboratives using blended facilitation. Facilitators internal to each site (a 4-person leadership team) worked with external facilitators (members of the CONCERT team). The collaboratives involved interacting with eight CLCs (August 2018 to April 2019; mixture of in-person plus virtual external facilitation), thirty-one CLCs (April 2019 to August 2019; exclusively virtual external facilitation), and ninety-five CLCs (January 2020 to April 2021; in-person facilitation in January 2020 and virtual external facilitation thereafter). External facilitation consisted of facilitating multiday learning sessions, conducting site-level consultations, conducting individual site as well as group-level coaching, conducting interactive webinars, and communicating with and across sites through phone calls, email, office hours, newsletters, and a web-based site. Internal facilitation was exclusively in-person until the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, after which it varied by site but remained mostly in-person.\n"," During the learning intensives, our team used a continual QI process. During multi-day learning sessions and site visits, we met daily to debrief, to learn from that day's successes and challenges and improve the next. We also met weekly as a team; each meeting included a facilitation update and problem-solving time to harness the power of the team to solve facilitation issues. As of April 2020, we began an additional, weekly, 2h facilitator development training, in which the team, led by expert consultants, focused exclusively on honing their facilitation skills. In preparation for this paper, we reviewed the extensive written record of these various team meetings and met iteratively as a team to condense what we learned. Based on this, we provide the following recommendations for enabling successful larger-scale virtual implementation facilitation with groups.\n"," Many principles that are critical to successful virtual implementation are also important in any implementation facilitation effort. External facilitators have traditionally often done some of their work virtually. But because a completely virtual environment means people are never in close physical proximity, in our experience, virtual external implementation facilitation requires special consideration beyond and different from in-person external implementation facilitation. Below, we describe three overarching principles of virtual external implementation facilitation: pilot everything, incorporate a model, and prioritize metacognition. We also describe five practical principlesplan in advance, communicate in real time, build relationships, engage participants, and construct a \"room\"-and how to enact these.\n"," Key to virtual external implementation facilitation success is a continuous QI mindset. Because operating virtually means you are often navigating unfamiliar territory, it is important to start small and use plan-dostudy-act cycles to continually refine your processes. To this end, external facilitation team members should take the approach that all applications of the practical principles below are pilot projects that the team studies, discusses, and modifies to try to improve. Holding regular facilitation-team debriefs and trainings are crucial components of this process. To help gain objective feedback, it helps to assign some team members roles as outside observers, where they step outside their team roles during certain portions of the external facilitation experience (such as shadowing on calls or being note-taker during a larger learning session) to observe and provide objective input during the team debrief.\n"," A model can help guide your virtual external implementation facilitation process by providing clear goals. In our national work, we followed the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's breakthrough series model [19] . This model emphasizes the importance of the external facilitators in bringing implementation-site participants together in iterative cycles to learn about a focused topic, facilitating these participants' developing action plans, and supporting their implementing the action plans in their local environments, including helping identify and resolve problems. In our work, this model helped focus the actions we took to enact the practical principles below. The model, for example, reminded us to always emphasize the importance of the participants' learning from peers as well as recognized experts. And its emphasis on continuous QI as the participants implement the evidence-based practice necessitated our also continually improving our communication and support mechanisms. The breakthrough series model is only one example; external facilitators should incorporate the model that fits their work best.\n"," Adults learn new information best when they quickly have opportunities to apply it and those opportunities are coupled with speaking or writing about what happened when they applied it and with reflecting on what they will do when applying it next [20] [21] [22] . This thinking process is called metacognition. By incorporating structured opportunities for both external facilitators and participants to have metacognitive experiences, preferably by talking in groups, information about the new material is encoded into their long-term memories, making them more likely to act on it at their next opportunity [23] [24] [25] . This enables both external facilitators and participants to continually improve. An example of how we enacted this principle was by conducting immediate, daily, external facilitator debriefs after any prolonged facilitation efforts with participants (e.g., after a learning session or a site visit).\n"," Advance planning is critical to the success of any external implementation facilitation endeavor. But virtual situations require additional planning to compensate for the lack of ability to work together quickly onsite to compensate for the unexpected. In an in-person environment, if a piece of technology fails or a presenter shows up late, for example, facilitators can avail themselves of numerous impromptu ways to hold participants' attention. These scenarios play out differently when people do not share the same physical space. Planning ahead for virtual external implementation facilitation, therefore, requires not only preparing for how you would like things to proceed under ideal conditions but also planning for failure and how to avoid or deal with the many things that can go wrong.\n"," Communication is key to external facilitation. In a virtual situation, external facilitators are likely not in the same location as the participants. In the case of external facilitation endeavors that involve multiple external facilitators simultaneously, external facilitators may also not be in the same location as each other. In addition, virtual communication may or may not involve video. Communication in these situations, therefore, involves more than would be required in a room where people can talk or gesture to one another. External facilitators must prepare to meet participants at the participants' virtual communication comfort level. For scheduled interactions, external facilitators should develop a communication mechanism that enables real-time trouble shooting. This may mean keeping an eye on email or messaging platforms when holding a support call, so anyone with technical difficulties can inform facilitators. Many virtual meeting platforms enable behind-the-scenes communication. When there are multiple facilitators for a training, for example, facilitators benefit from practicing with these and other rapid communication mechanisms such as group text messaging to ensure they can inform, trouble shoot, and brainstorm in real time to support participants.\n"," A virtual environment increases the danger that relationship-building among participants and between participants and external facilitators may be more difficult or may not happen as quickly or as well as in an inperson environment. Participants, for example, cannot turn to the person next to them at a table; external facilitators cannot walk around the room or-if there is no video or there are multiple people on a video call-read non-verbal cues. For external facilitators, it is also much more difficult to gauge the \"temperature\" of a room and react accordingly to increase or modify the level or type of support. Virtual external implementation facilitators must consequently be more consistently vigilant about generating opportunities to develop and support relationships among and with participants. This may mean working with participants to pilot different options, finding the best fit for particular circumstances; creating deliberate, regular opportunities for participant feedback; and individualizing and tailoring external facilitation approaches more than might be required under in-person conditions.\n"," Participant engagement in a virtual environment also poses particular challenges from an external facilitation perspective, because participants may experience competing demands for their time that they would not experience if interactions with facilitators were in person. Without the peer pressure of a physically communal activity and with the added pressures of one's local environment and multitasking temptations or requirements, it is also easier for participants to disengage partially or completely. And in a completely virtual environment, facilitators may not be immediately aware of such disengagement when it occurs. Knowing that participants may be distracted at some points, it is critical to include presentation slides that clearly spell out the teaching points at multiple locations in the presentation so that if a participant is distracted for a short period, they will be able to catch up. Building in and enacting specific techniques aimed at fostering participant engagement throughout the virtual external implementation experience-such as more frequent but shorter duration check-ins, participating in regularly scheduled meetings at the participant's site instead of relying only on separate facilitation meetings, multiplying contact options, or creating brief but meaningful newsletters or important topic webinars-is thus critical to success.\n"," Precisely because no actual room exists in a virtual environment, it is critical that participants feel a sense of being together in a virtual space with both their peers and the external facilitators. External facilitators must therefore use specific methods to create opportunities for supporting these needs by recognizing and taking advantage of opportunities virtual environments afford, such as using logos and other branding, building togetherness by acknowledging who is participating, and systematically calling on participants so everyone's voice is heard.\n"," Enacting the practical principles described above is possible when external facilitators take multiple actions. We describe these below. Table 1 augments these descriptions by using example illustrations from our national work.\n"," Successful virtual external implementation facilitation requires having clear roles that both facilitation team members and participants recognize and understand. Key among these roles is that of the greeter. A greeter is an identified external facilitation team member who greets everyone who enters a virtual room and who keeps the conversation flowing until the formal agenda begins. The greeter needs to know who will join the meeting (both participants and presenters), who will facilitate the agenda, and the timing of various aspects of the meeting. The greeter should always be the first person to enter the virtual room, so they can identify and interact with participants as they join, welcoming them and assuring them they are in the right place. If possible, the greeter should be on screen or speaking over a placeholder slide with the program name or agenda and start time. The greeter sets the first tone, which should be upbeat and friendly. Greeters should ensure there is no extended silence as everyone waits for the meeting to begin, instead immediately engaging participants. Ahead of time, the greeter should prepare a list of questions to ask, topics about which to chat with participants, or topical information to share. Greeters should also keep the perspective of the newly entering participant in mind. If the greeter is working a virtual room with many participants, every 60 seconds or so, they should clearly identify what they are doing, e.g., \"If you are just coming on, welcome. We will begin at the top of the hour. I'm Sharon, and I'm here to welcome you. If you are having any technical difficulties, here are some troubleshooting resources.\" If people cannot see each other, when new participants join, the greeter should always identify who is already in the meeting in as much detail as possible, creating a sense of a virtual room. If attendance is expected or mandatory, the greeter should check off participants as they join and, behind the scenes, alert other team members to reach out to those who have not joined the meeting by the start time, to ensure they have the proper information needed to connect or help with technical difficulties.\n"," When the meeting begins, the greeter announces publicly who is in the meeting (or shares some other metric of attendance) and introduces the external facilitator and any internal facilitators (facilitators who are located at the sites). In addition to their main role of engaging with and helping participants implement the intervention, the facilitators introduce topics, announce transitions, and continually orient participants to where the program stands regarding the agenda. They remain flexible, supporting participant input, and delegate troubleshooting tasks to other team members. Because participants' first and final impressions of any interactions are important, facilitators should prepare and rehearse the main portions of their role, including opening and closing remarks and how they will react if unanticipated challenges arise. Their goal is to engage the participants and remain calm if things do not go according to plan.\n"," External facilitation team members should also take responsibility for other roles to keep the virtual activities flowing smoothly. This works best if team members have opportunities to practice the roles ahead of time. The following is a selection of important roles that apply in various situations; a team member can have more than one role.\n"," shows if attendance is mandatory and keeps a database for monitoring the facilitation's reach) 2. Recording manager (starts and stops the recording if the interaction will be recorded) 3. Chat box moderator (moderates and monitors the chat box or other communication mechanism and informs the facilitator(s) if there are issues or questions that need to be addressed) 4. Presentation moderator (shares screens and advances slides) 5. Technical trouble shooter (helps team members and participants with technical connection or other issues)\n"," Video and audio conference platforms usually enable a private chat feature but may not support a sub-group chat. Consider creating a group chat via cell phone for members of the external and internal facilitation teams. Example: The greeter should welcome participants and avoid awkward silences while participants are gathering (e.g., \"Good morning, this is Ryann from the CONCERT team. The program will start in just a few minutes. In the meantime, please type your name and location in the chat box.\"). Once the program starts, the greeter hands off to a second team member who facilitates the content of the meeting. While the content facilitator directs the program, another team member troubleshoots individual technical issues and/ or manages chat boxes.\n"," Create small cohorts If there are a large number of participants, deliberately separate participants into smaller groups (organized by facility, location, role, any other relevant characteristic) to enable engagement, sharing, and encourage more meaningful interactions. It may be important to construct smaller groups that avoid hierarchical dilemmas (e.g., separating senior leaders from frontline staff for potentially volatile or personal conversations or mixing sites so supervisors are not in the same group as their own supervisees). Example: During the completely virtual external facilitation collaborative the 31 participating CLCs (> 120 individual participants) were separated into 3 cohorts for the duration of the collaborative. During a multi-day learning session cohort 1 (n = 10 CLCs,~40 individual participants) was further divided into 3 smaller breakout groups. During the learning session, the 3 small groups each participated in separate online breakout sessions to discuss performance improvement projects they had implement in their individual CLCs. External facilitators present at each breakout session facilitated discussion across participants, enabling them to highlight their keys to success and other lessons learned. This facilitated discussion was used to help build Power-Point storyboards for each small group to present during the next segment of the learning session. All small group assignments and connection information for the breakout session were included in the agenda, which was sent to all participants prior to the start of the learning session.\n"," Provide clarity and structure for interactions with/among participants Explicitly outline for the participants who will be serving in the various facilitation roles. Example: The attendance monitor and facilitator contacts no-shows if attendance is mandatory and keeps a database for monitoring the facilitation's reach. The recording manager starts and stops the recording if the interaction will be recorded. The chat box moderator monitors the chat box or other communication mechanism and informs the facilitator(s) if there are issues or questions that need to be addressed. The presentation moderator shares screens and advances slides. The technical trouble shooter helps team members and participants with technical connection or other issues.\n"," Providing structure for the program's content ensures participants all have similar experiences and focus on the program's content. Example: Create a structured action plan that reinforces learning objectives for participants by guiding them through the plan in a stepwise fashion offline. We provide an example of a templated action plan as an online supplement.\n"," Adding visual components to an audio presentation will enhance participant engagement and keep their attention. Be succinct and use graphics to help convey your message. Example: Construct PowerPoint slides with less text and more content-related graphics. If presenting a PowerPoint or other slides, write the important points in the notes section and keep your audience's attention by having few words on the slides. Before breakout sessions, share a summary slide to remind participants about key issues and guide small group discussion. These bulleted talking points (e.g., please discuss the following: (1) your lessons learned, (2) what you will do differently now that you have learned this new information, (3) how you will take this forward) help participants share their experiences and learn from others.\n"," Create time in the agenda for participants to immediately apply learned knowledge in their local setting. Give participants a relatively simple task and reconvene the virtual group to discuss how it went and how to move forward. Example: Following a virtual presentation about how to implement a new quality improvement activity, participants from each team are given an hour to practice the activity together locally. Participants then return to the online platform to discuss how the activity went and create action plans for implementing the activity more broadly in their local site.\n"," Have a plan in place in case there are issues with technology and be sure to have a way to communicate with your team outside of the online platform. Example: The external facilitation team connects to the online platform to practice delivering the evidencebased implementation content, with assigned team roles in place. Technical difficulties are identified, so the team decides to create a text message group to use the day of the event. This enables the team members to reach each other about technical difficulties or suggestions in real time during the virtual presentation.\n"," Engage everyone Facilitators should invite each participant into conversations (via audio or chat), being mindful of group dynamics and continually focusing on collaborative subjects. Example: Conduct round robin check-ins during audio sessions in which all participants take turns sharing their experiences. Round robin sharing sessions can then transition to facilitated discussions in which participants and facilitators help each other brainstorm challenges and next steps.\n"," This has the advantage of not being dependent on any one platform's functionality and enables alerts and problem-solving conversations to occur behind the scenes.\n"," If the participants number more than a dozen individuals, having meaningful interaction as a large group during the virtual implementation facilitation becomes difficult. Breaking the larger group into smaller facilitated cohorts that meet separately during selected portions of a meeting overcomes this challenge. It enables meaningful sharing among participants and enables them to set their own agenda items more easily. One way to do this is to randomly assign participants behind the scenes. Alternatively, a deliberate, ahead-of-time purposive division into groups based on known relevant characteristics may also increase diversity during meaningful interactions. To promote richer, more inclusive discussions, the external facilitation team can help construct these smaller groups with the participants themselves and/or any internal facilitators. It is critical that participants have a clear plan and supporting materials for the small groups before separation from a larger group. External facilitators can work with sites to create downloadable or sent-ahead-of-time handouts with exercises, roles, time limits, and troubleshooting information. Consider showing the small group instructions with screen sharing and walking participants through the instructions before sending them to the small groups, no matter how clear your supporting materials may be. And always allow for questions if members get confused. Participants should also have a way to reach an identified facilitation team member(s) in case of trouble. Some platforms do not have clear ways of calling for help. Clarify for participants how they will get help if they get in their breakout groups and they are confused.\n"," Having smaller groups work together can foster a sense of community and collaboration among participants. They can help each other as peers, coaching one another through the application of what they have learned, focusing on each participant's strengths. Sharing experiences also helps reinforce concepts and techniques.\n"," The first interaction of participants with a program is often through an initial agenda distributed ahead of time, constructed either by external facilitators or, ideally, by external and internal facilitators and participants working together. This agenda should be clear to a naïve reader. Icons or other visuals can be used to identify repeated actions or clarify the contents of longer agendas that may otherwise overwhelm participants with too much text. In addition to presenting information about content, the agenda should also set expectations for participant interaction and engagement.\n"," As indicated above, facilitators can provide structure to meetings. At the beginning of the meeting, the facilitator can state the mutually understood objectives and support the participants in meeting those objectives throughout. At the end of the meeting, the facilitator can provide closure by recapping what the facilitation team and the participants will each do as next steps. The external facilitator can also provide structure by ensuring the meeting adheres to its schedule. If urgent issues arise during the session, the external facilitator can indicate the facilitation team will follow up, change future sessions, or adjust the remaining agenda items. If changes to the meeting time need to be made, make them during a break for the participants and keep the meeting and meeting section start and end times the same, as participants have likely structured their schedules around these times.\n"," Structuring as much as is feasible will help ensure core intervention components are described, reinforced, and implemented. Having structured handouts and notes templates for exercises or other participant experiences help participants understand the evidence-based implementation's goals, focus their efforts, and share information with fellow participants or others. They give participants tools to capture meaningful data and information and help participants with the hands-on application of knowledge they have gained. To the extent it is desirable, they also ensure all participants have similar experiences. Example structured content includes action plans, report back templates, and train-the-trainer tools. For these, the visuals and graphics should be the same as those used in any program presentations, so participants can easily match program content to the structured content. Ideally, structured exercises and experiences will be created in a collaborative effort between external and internal facilitators, as internal facilitators have the greatest sense of what will work best for participants from their sites.\n"," Visuals provide an important supplement to audio interactions. Visuals give participants another way to learn and engage. In advance of a meeting, for example, it can be helpful to send participants documents for review and input. The visuals in these documents should be clear and designed to orient participants. Draw attention to key pieces of information using color, bolding, highlighting, shapes, or call-out boxes. The goal is to create cognitive ease for participants [26] . External facilitators should think about what is needed to convey implementation-relevant content in a clear, engaging, and succinct way and work with internal facilitators and participants to tailor and adapt materials to site needs. Always pilot test visuals with naïve users or internal facilitators before sending to participants or using in a presentation. What seems meaningful to external facilitators who understand the content may not be meaningful to participants for whom the content is new [27, 28] .\n"," If possible, it is helpful to build time directly into the virtual external facilitation agenda for participants to immediately apply knowledge gained during an interaction. Collaborate with internal facilitators and/or participants to review agendas for potential activity opportunitieslook for areas where it is important to reinforce a concept or technique important for the evidence-based practice implementation. In those places, build an activity that participants can do at their own sites. This should be a relatively simple task and easy for participants to do without much logistical effort or preplanning (although some pre-planning can be expected if participants are notified of the expectation well in advance of the meeting). Incorporate time in the agenda for participants to do the activity at their site and for them to debrief in smaller cohorts. This way they both gain the applied experience and have the metacognitive experience that comes with discussing it with others.\n"," External implementation facilitation involves being nimble. Interactions with sites and participants may go differently than expected. Issues that may arise include challenges with engaging participants, problems connecting to conferencing platform, and key participants being suddenly absent for unexpected reasons. External facilitators can ensure participants will have the best interaction possible and that the interactions meet the intended goal of the activities by creating backup plans in collaboration with internal facilitators or key participants. If participants are silent or disengaged, for example, have an easy-to-answer set of questions ready. If the video platform does not work, make sure everyone knows a backup conference phone number. If an interaction is planned to be especially large, long, or complex, create a checklist [29] . Having backup plans whenever possible will enable the best use of limited virtual interactions with participants.\n"," Participant engagement is critical for successful virtual external implementation facilitation. The external facilitation team should deliberately invite each participant into the conversation. This is why group size is critical and groups where participants number over a dozen should be broken down into smaller cohorts with separate external facilitators. When having a conversation with participants, whether the conversation is in writing (chat box) or by voice, external and/or internal facilitators should acknowledge off topic comments for later discussion and, when necessary, redirect the conversation to ensure opportunities for all to participate. Having an attendee list helps in this regard, particularly for keeping track of who has spoken and being able to call on people by name or group.\n"," During this process, external facilitators need to be mindful of group dynamics and traditional hierarchical structures, which is why collaborating with internal facilitators is so important. Groups may have leaders and supervisors in them as well as other staff, potentially making it more difficult for staff to speak openly. In such cases, it is best to begin with collaborative subjects and redirect any conversation towards collaboration and group strengths. If certain participants are overpowering or monopolizing the conversation, acknowledge their point, if appropriate, and pull in those who are quiet by calling on them directly to contribute their opinions. Ultimately, try to model and create a safe space for all to contribute, to maximize the impact of the external facilitation.\n"," The overarching and practical principles described here represent a novel conceptualization of virtual external implementation facilitation that gives a practical structure to a process that heretofore in the literature has been inadequately described. The associated actions we describe are demonstrably useful techniques for supporting the principles and offer teams that are interested in virtual external implementation facilitation concrete methods by which to ensure success. Our examples stem from our experiences in using the principles in healthcare. But they can, in principle, be applied to virtual external implementation facilitation, regardless of setting, as the principles and actions are not setting specific. We encourage broad use of the principles and actions to harness the power that virtual methods can bring to external implementation facilitation.\n","Score: 1.5395325148415262\n","\n","Title: TURINGBENCH: A Benchmark Environment for Turing Test in the Age of Neural Text Generation\n","Body Text: Recently, the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has seen a massive improvement. While the field of NLG has existed for some time since even before the onset of the first chatbot ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966) , the recent neural architecture Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) has led to speedy improvement in the generation of long coherent texts. GPT-1 (Radford et al., 2018) created by OpenAI is the first installment of these PROMPT: Some investigators struggle to reach Comey HUMAN: Some congressional investigators want to bring former FBI Director James Comey to the Hill to tell them about his meetings with President Donald Trump but they can't find him. GPT-2: Some investigators struggle to reach Comey and his team because the FBI's headquarters is in Northern Virginia. But the FBI has a lot of other people who can help. FAIR: We have a duty to be vigilant. James Comey's testimony today should make him think twice about it. The White House said Trump had spoken with Comey during the hour-long meeting and that all the senior U.S. officials were given a \"heads up\" on the situation. GPT-3: \"Like Louis XVI, he doesn't see the storm growing in the distance,\" says the Democratic operative. The lack of specifics, even from surrogates on Trump's behalf, forces well-known Democrats to point out the obvious. new waves of text-generators. In fact, GPT-1 was built with 117 million parameters, however, in less than 3 years, Google's Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021) was the largest language model with 1.6 trillion parameters as of January-June 2021. Currently, the largest language model is Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence's (BAAI) Wu-Dao 2.0 with 1.75 trillion parameters. Even more alarming, since the birth of GPT-1, the field of NLG has grown exponentially such that Hugging Face's model repo houses more than 9K English and non-English language models (of which over 2K are text-generators). See Figure 2 for evolution of neural text-generators. Naturally, these newer language models are able to generate texts that can be easily misconstrued as human-written. Thus, due to the superior quality of recent generated texts and how easily such text-generators can be used, the potential for misuse is great. This misuse includes but is not limited to the spread of misinformation (Zellers et al., 2019) and political propa- ganda (Varol et al., 2017) . Therefore, it is urgent that we tackle ways to automatically distinguish machine-generated texts from human-written ones accurately.\n"," To build accurate detectors of machinegenerated texts, sufficient data is required but lacking. Therefore, we create a benchmark environment, TURINGBENCH, to combat the obvious security issue language models could pose. Just in line with benchmark environments such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) that tremendously facilitate the progress of Natural Language Understanding, we build the first benchmark for Authorship Attribution in the form of the Turing Test by including humans and neural language models.\n"," The TURINGBENCH Environment comprises benchmark datasets, benchmark tasks, and a website to host leaderboards. This benchmark dataset is created by collecting 10K news articles (mostly in politics) written by journalists in media outlets such as CNN, Washington Post, etc. Using the Title of each article, we Prompt 19 selected neural text-generators to generate an article similar to the human-written one. This creates 200K articles with 20 labels (or authors). Next, we have two benchmark tasks -Turing Test and Authorship Attribution. The Turing Test task is modeled after the Turing Test concept (Turing, 2009) , where if a machine shows intelligent behavior or characteristics usually attributed to a human, then the machine has passed the test. In this scenario, the goal is to cause the machine to fail the Turing Test. Thus, we define this benchmark task as a binary classification problem with human and machine labels. Given 19 neural text-generators, there are 19 Turing Test subtasks with 19 human-machine pairs. Furthermore, we understand that due to the ubiquitous nature of these neural language models, distinguishing machine-generated texts from humanwritten ones is no longer sufficient. It is now also important we inquire as to which particular neural text-generator authored a piece of text. To this end, the Authorship Attribution task aims to assign authorship to one of the many text-generators. We study 20 authors for this task, however, as we have observed, this can easily become 2K authors very soon which will grossly exacerbate the difficulty of this task. Finally, to host all these tasks and datasets, we build a TURINGBENCH website with leaderboards for each benchmark task and call for participation in tackling this very relevant and nontrivial problem.\n"," Lastly, we compare State-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline Turing Test and Authorship Attribution models. From the experimental results, we observe that we need more complex models to accurately distinguish machine-generated texts from humanwritten ones, including text-generators that are yet to be created.\n"," Neural Text Generation Recent advances in neural network-based language modeling have demonstrated promising results in text generation (Garbacea and Mei, 2020). Current state-ofthe-art neural text generation models can produce texts approaching the quality of human-written ones, especially in terms of grammar, fluency, coherency, and usage of real world knowledge (Radford et al., 2018 (Radford et al., , 2019 Keskar et al., 2019; Zellers et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020) . The progress in neural text generation has facilitated a wide range of applications: dialog response generation (Zhang et al., 2020 ), storytelling (Fan et al., 2018 See et al., 2019 ), table-to-text generation (Lebret et al., 2016 , code comment generation (Alon et al., 2018) , medical report generation (Liu et al., 2019a) .\n"," However, as these language models can generate text indistinguishable from human-written text, they can also be misused by adversaries to generate fake news (Shu et al., 2017; Zellers et al., 2019; Mosallanezhad et al., 2020; Shu et al., 2021) , fake produce reviews (Fornaciari and Poesio, 2014; Adelani et al., 2020) , spam emails (Das and Verma, 2018) .\n"," Automatic Detection of Generated Text Given the potential malicious applications of text generation (Solaiman et al., 2019) , it is thus vital to build detectors to distinguish text generated by machines from humans (Gehrmann et al., 2019; Bakhtin et al., 2019; Jawahar et al., 2020; Varshney et al., 2020; Çano and Bojar, 2020) . Most current work focus on fake news detection (Rashkin et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2019; Bhat and Parthasarathy, 2020; Zhong et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2020; Ippolito et al., 2020) . Despite this progress, it remains a challenging task to build generalizable, interpretable, and robust detectors (Jawahar et al., 2020) .\n"," Authorship Attribution Authorship Attribution (AA) aims to decide the author of a given text from a set of candidates (Houvardas and Stamatatos, 2006; Stamatatos, 2009b; Zhang et al., 2014) . AA has a broad range of applications including author profiling (López-Monroy et al., 2020), computer forensics (Lambers and Veenman, 2009), and plagiarism detection (Stamatatos, 2009a) . Previous work on AA has explored and combined various features and representations at different levels including n-grams (Escalante et al., 2011; Sapkota et al., 2015 Sapkota et al., , 2016 (Uchendu et al., 2020) .\n"," However, previous AA work largely focuses on authorship attribution among humans, while only a few papers (Manjavacas et al., 2017; Uchendu et al., 2020; Munir et al., 2021) study neural generated text. Our work aims to provide the first benchmark for Authorship Attribution in the form of the Turing Test by including humans and neural language models. Dathathri et al., 2020) . In addition, some of these language models have multiple pre-trained models and thus, we were able to generate texts with 19 neural machine textgenerators. We choose these 10 language model architectures because they are currently considered as the SOTA text-generators, many of the text-generators on Hugging Face's model repo are variants of these language models, and both their pre-trained models and codes were publicly available.\n"," To generate texts, all 19 neural generators require a short prompt and a specified number of words to generate texts. Table 1 (and Appendix) describes each language model in detail. Figure 4 illustrates the data creation process. Table 2 summarizes the stats of dataset and the model sizes.\n"," The Turing Test (TT) Task Our proposed Turing Test task aims to answer the question: Can we determine if a piece of text is human-written or machine-generated? This task is formulated as a binary classification problem with two labelshuman and machine -modeled after the classical Turing Test problem. The Turing Test examines the ability of a machine text-generator to exhibit intelligible behavior ascribed to humans. The goal is to build a model that causes the machine-generated texts to fail the Turing Test. Lastly, the TT task contains 19 subtasks with 19 human-machine pairs (e.g. GPT-2 XL vs. Human, GROVER_base vs. Human, etc.).\n"," We collected news titles (mostly Politics) and contents from CNN, Washington Post, and Kaggle. The Kaggle datasets had news articles from 2014-2020, and 2019-2020 for the CNN and Washington Post news articles. Next, we removed articles that did not have the desired word length (i.e., 200-500). This resulted in 130K articles, but only 10K was used for the article generations. See data generation process in Figure 4 .\n"," GPT-1 Texts are generated with the Hugging Face github repo (Wolf et al., 2019) . GPT-2\n"," We use 5 GPT-2 pre-trained models -PyTorch model, small (124 million parameters), medium (355 million parameters), large (774 million parameters), and x-large (1558 million parameters) to generate texts. Texts are generated with the OpenAI GPT-3 API using the davinci engine. GROVER We use code from repo to generate from Grover's 3 pre-trained models: GROVER-base, GROVER-large, GROVER-mega.\n"," Conditional Transformer Language Model For Controllable Generation uses control codes to guide generation. We use News control code to generate long articles. XLM\n"," We generated texts using Hugging Face repo (Wolf et al., 2019) . XLNET We generated texts with: 2 XLNET pre-trained models: XLNET-base, and XLNET-large using Hugging Face. FAIR_wmt\n"," We use two Facebook's FAIR English models -wmt19 (Ng et al., 2019) and wmt20 to generate texts with FAIRSEQ sequence modeling toolkit. TRANSFORMER_XL\n"," We generated texts with this language model's setup on Hugging Face (Wolf et al., 2019) . PPLM PPLM fuses GPT-2's pre-trained model with bag of words to generate more specific texts. We used the Politics bag of words model to generate texts. Next, we fused PPLM with two pre-trained models (i.e., distilGPT-2, and GPT-2) and generated texts with them, forming: PPLM_distil, PPLM_gpt2. These models are gotten from the Hugging Face model repository. 188.9 ± 52.0 11.9 ± 4.5 124M The Authorship Attribution (AA) Task Authorship Attribution is the identification and proper assignment of the author of a piece of text (Coyotl-Morales et al., 2006) . Our Authorship Attribution task aims to answer the question: If we determine that an article is human-written or machinegenerated, can we further determine which neural language model generated all the articles that are said to be machine-generated? This is a multi-class classification problem modeled after the traditional Authorship Attribution problem.\n"," We keep 168, 612 articles out of 200K after cleaning the text (see Appendix for data pre-processing details), and we build the benchmark dataset for from datasets import load_dataset import pandas as pd each benchmark task -TT and AA. For the TT task, there are 20 labels (i.e., 19 machine text-generators and 1 human), thus we can only have 19 pairs of human vs. machine. Therefore, we have 19 datasets for the TT task. To increase the difficulty of the TT task, we cut each article in the test set in half, using only 50% of the words. For the AA task, we have 1 dataset containing all the labels. All datasets have train/validation/test sets which were split using the 70:10:20 ratio, respectively. To avoid topic bias, these sets were carefully split, such that all articles in the sets were unique to each other. Therefore, all articles generated by a prompt belonged only to one set.\n"," To make this dataset public, we added our datasets for each benchmark task and subtask to Hugging Face datasets 1 . Figure 5 demonstrates how to load the TURINGBENCH dataset.\n"," Evaluation Metrics We use the traditional evaluation metrics such as: Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Accuracy to evaluate Machine/Deep Learning models for the benchmark tasks. However, for the TT tasks, we only use F1 scores since it is a more robust measure for the imbalanced datasets.\n"," To create this TURINGBENCH environment, we built 2 versions of datasets -binary setting (i.e., human vs. GROVER-large, human vs. GPT-1, etc.) for the TT tasks, and multi-class setting (i.e., human vs. GROVER-Large vs. GPT-1 vs. etc.) for the AA task. To track progress, as shown in Figure 6 , we create a website where each task and sub-task 1 https://huggingface.co/datasets/ turingbench/TuringBench/tree/main ) on a piece of text generated by GPT-3. Green represents the most probable words; yellow the 2nd most probable; Red the least probable; and purple the highest improbable words. Machine-generated texts are often populated with mostly Green and yellow words. However, we see that GPT-3-generated texts is very human-like. has its own leaderboard that displays the evaluation metric scores of models. Furthermore, to ensure the integrity of the process, even though contributors can obtain the TURINGBENCH datasets from Hugging Face datasets, we still ask contributors to submit their code and/or trained model weights for private testing. After testing, we update the website with the new models' scores. Lastly, we rank the model performance using the F1 score from best to worst.\n"," We experiment with several SOTA and baseline models as summarized in Table 3 for Turing Test  and Table 4 for Authorship Attribution, and Ta-\n"," Description\n"," We use the GROVER-Large discriminator that is trained to detect GROVER-generated texts to predict the test labels.\n"," We use the trained weights of RoBERTa-large fine-tuned on GPT-2 XL outputs to predict the human and machine label of the test dataset. GLTR\n"," In the GLTR demo, the words are color coded to improve human detection of machine-generated texts. Top 0-10 probable words are green; top 10-100 probable words are yellow; top 100-1000 probable words are red and top greater than 1000 words are purple. See Figure 7 for an example of using GLTR and interpretation of its color schemes. Thus, we define human-written texts to be any article that 10% or more of the words belong in the top >1000 (i.e., purple words). BERT We fine-tune bert-base-cased on the train set and classify on the test set.\n"," We fine-tune RoBERTa-base, a variant of BERT with the train set.

In order to make the TT task even more difficult, we train and validate on the full articles generated by the text-generators and test on only 50% of the words of each article in the test set. We intend to capture the differences that will exist between train and test data in the real world in this scenario. We compare 3 SOTA TT models -GROVER detector (Zellers et al., 2019) , GPT-2 detector (Solaiman et al., 2019), and GLTR (Gehrmann et al., 2019). We observe in Table 5 that the average F1 scores are 0.56, 0.60, and 0.57, respectively. Next, using other text classifiers such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) brings a significant improvement in F1 scores (0.85 for both BERT and RoBERTa).\n"," This performance improvement occurs mainly because BERT and RoBERTa are fine-tuned with the train set of each TT subtasks, while the TT models' pre-trained models were used to classify the test set without any further training.\n"," Additionally, averaging over all the 5 TT models, we find that FAIR_wmt20 and GPT-3, the most recent text-generators in the list, achieve the lowest average F1 score (0.49 and 0.55), thus making them the language models that produce the most indistinguishable texts, while XLNET_large has the highest average F1 score (0.87) using all TT models. XLNET has a high F1 score because it implements a text padding technique for generation which often negatively affects the generation quality.\n"," We also run two human experiments using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) environment, recruiting workers with at least 95% approval rate of Human Intelligence Task (HIT). In the experiments, we randomly sampled 50 articles per each language model (across all 19 models) and performed two tests, where workers (1) vote if a given article is machine-generated or not, and (2) vote which of two given articles is machine-generated. These experiments yielded the AVG-accuracies of 0.535 and 0.513 (random-guess=0.5), respectively. This part of experiments was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution. \n"," Since there are 20 labels in AA, the chance performance is at 0.05 (i.e., 5% in accuracy). Due to this difficulty, we use the full article contents in the test set. We compare different SOTA and popular techniques for automatic authorship attribution for our AA task including Random We find that BERT and RoBERTa outperform all the AA models, sometimes significantly, achieving the F1 scores of 0.80 and 0.81, respectively.\n"," 2 https://huggingface.co/roberta-base-openai-detector Interestingly, we observe that OpenAI detector, a RoBERTa-base model fine-tuned on GPT-2 XL outputs, does not outperform BERT-Multinomial and RoBERTa-Multinomial for this AA task although it performs comparatively, achieving a 0.77 as F1 score. BertAA achieves a slightly better F1 score (0.78).\n"," We present several observations from our experimental results.\n"," 1. Both TT and AA tasks are non-trivial: The average F1 score for each human vs. machine subtask and TT model is below 0.87, with FAIR_wmt20 achieving the lowest (0.49). FAIR_wmt20 is the newest text-generator in our list and before that we have GPT-3 which achieves the second lowest average F1 score (0.55). This suggests a trend that as newer textgenerators get built, generated texts will become even more human-like, making the TT and AA tasks more difficult.\n"," Additionally, the difficulty of the AA task is further demonstrated by the PCA plot of linguistic features LIWC of the TURINGBENCH dataset in Figure 8 . Using LIWC to capture stylistic signatures of authors has been studied (Goldstein et al., 2009; Uchendu et al., 2020) . However, we observe that there are quite a few overlaps in linguistic features across different authors (i.e., language models). This makes these authors' writing styles linearly inseparable.\n"," No one size fits all: We observe in Table 5 that there is no one detection model that performs well across all 20 TT tasks. For instance, while BERT achieved the highest average F1 score, it still underperformed in detecting FAIR_wmt20. However, GROVER detector achieved a highest F1 score in detecting FAIR_wmt20.\n"," 3. Humans detect machine-generated texts at chance level: First two columns of Table 5 show the results of human detection test. In the first AMT-based tests, we randomly sampled 50 machine-generated texts and asked humans to decide if the given text is human-written or machine-generated (i.e., humans do not know whether they are shown only machine-generated texts in the test). In the second test, we showed two texts at ramdom, one written by humans and the other generated by machines, and asked humans to decide which of the two are machinegenerated (i.e., humans know that at least one of two is machine-generated).\n"," Based on the average accuracies of two human tests, by and large, we observe that humans currently differentiate machine-generated texts from human-written ones, not much better (i.e., 0.535 and 0.513) than the level of random guessing (i.e., 0.5).\n"," 4. Not all text-generators are created equal: As shown in Table 5 , the average F1 score for each human vs. machine subtask and TT model is below 0.87, with FAIR_wmt20 achieving the lowest (0.49). Consequently, this suggests that FAIR_wmt20 is the most sophisticated textgenerator and thus, the hardest to detect. Other generators that are also hard to detect based on their < 0.62 F1 scores are: GPT-3, GPT-2_small, GPT-2_medium, GPT-2_large, and GPT-2_XL.\n"," 5. Sophisticated machine-generated texts often get detected as human-written: We observe an interesting phenomenon with these SOTA TT models. For instance, even though the labels in the binary classification task are approximately evenly split, GPT-2 detector and GLTR achieve below F1 score of 0.4 in some subtasks. This happens because TT models do not generalize well to those specific text-generators (i.e., GROVER_base, CTRL, GPT-3, TRANS-FORMER_XL) and mistakenly predicts the majority of the texts as human-written.\n"," 6. TT models do not always perform as expected: While both GROVER and GPT-2 detectors are trained to detect GROVER-generated and GPT-2-generated texts, respectively, they underperform in detecting those texts. For instance, GROVER detector performs the best in detecting PPLM_distil and PPLM_gpt2 texts, while GPT-2 detector performs significantly better at detecting GPT-1, TRANSFORMER_XL and XLNET_large texts.\n"," 7. Length of texts does not affect model performance: Due to the varying length of texts (i.e. 100-400) in Table 2 , we plot the length of generated texts vs. the F1 scores of TT models in Figure 9 . However, the figure suggests that there is no clear correlation between model performance and length of texts for all models except RoBERTa. This suggests that RoBERTa performance is text length-dependent.\n"," 8. Traditional AA models cannot fully capture an author's style \"yet\": SOTA AA models cannot capture all of the stylistic features of human and machine text-generators. From Figure 8 we observe that the psycho-linguistic features of the 20 authors in the TURINGBENCH dataset are too similar, causing them to overlap in the plot. This suggests that machine-generated texts are becoming more similar to human-written texts in styles.\n"," Therefore, traditional ways to capture an author's writing style will no longer be sufficient to achieve accurate automatic authorship attribution. This is further confirmed in the performance of classical AA models such as SVM and Random Forest. Similarly, we find that even deep learning based AA models are still unable to fully capture the distinct writing styles of all 20 authors. These results suggest that one needs to develop a model that can unearth more subtle yet distinct patterns that exist across 20 models.\n"," 9. Humans have a wide writing style range: In Figure 8 , we observe that human-written features spread out all over the plot, while all machine-generated texts stay in little pockets of the plots. This suggests that humans may have a wider range of writing levels/styles, while Table 2 , no correlation between text length and F1 score was found.\n"," machines have a more limited range of writing levels/styles (e.g., high school to college).\n"," The experimental results suggest that we need better models to solve both TT and AA tasks as traditional AA models/features alone cannot solve the AA or TT problem. In addition, black-box detectors may be no longer sufficient for detection, as it cannot explain \"why\" a text is machine-generated or human-written yet. A research direction that GLTR-like framework points at may be able to help capture the nuanced nature of neural textgenerators better. In addition, in future, a more complicated situation may emerge where a user may generate different parts of an article using different neural text-generators to intentionally mask the writing style of the generated text, thus confusing detectors-i.e., Authorship Obfuscation.\n"," In this paper, we have introduced the TURING-BENCH environment and its preliminary results for both Turing Test (TT) and Authorship Attribution (AA) tasks. While varied, overall, (1) many contemporary language models can generate texts whose qualities are, to human eyes, indistinguishable from human-written texts, and (2) while some computational solutions for both TT and AA tasks can differentiate human-written texts from machine-generated ones much better than random guessing, overall, the community needs to research and develop better solutions for mission-critical applications. We hope that the TURINGBENCH environment will provide a platform on which insights into ways to tackle this urgent issue can be developed and shared.\n"," We build TURINGBENCH by collecting public human-written news articles (mostly politics), and use the Titles of these articles as Prompts to generate similar news articles with neural text-generators. Some of these human-written articles were scraped from CNN and Washington Post news websites, and others from Kaggle. See Appendix for links to Kaggle datasets. However, while the purpose of the TURINGBENCH environment is to call attention to the urgent need for detectors of machine-generated texts, the potential negative uses of this research are not lost on us. We understand that the insights we provide in this work can be used maliciously to thwart the performance of these detectors. Also, since we have released our dataset publicly, we understand that malicious users can copy the political articles generated by neural text-generators such as GPT-3, make minor changes, and post them online under the guise of real news. However, we believe that this work will lead to the creation of strong detectors of machine-generated texts, so that even human-edited machine-generated texts will still be detected in future. \n"," We collected news titles (mostly Politics) and contents from CNN, Washington Post, and Kaggle 3 4 5 6 .

Most of the energy demand is supplied by using fossil fuels, which are dominant contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting in global warming and further climate change. The circular economy (CE) is defined as a systems-level approach to economic development designed to benefit businesses, society, and the environment. 1 To tackle the climate crisis, the CE offers an approach that is not only powered by renewable energy, but also transforms the way products are designed and used. In other words, the main aim of the CE is to scale up low-carbon and efficiency solutions that will fulfill the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Struggling climate change and energy transformation are main challenges for a sustainable future. Thus, the policy makers take into accounts both ambitious plans about climate and enable business-led solutions in order to spread out and accelerate the implementation of the Paris Agreement. 2 The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) has been named for Kuznets 3 who hypothesized income (GDP) inequality first rises and then falls as economic development proceeds. 4 The concept of EKC was mentioned for the first time, in the early 1990s, and it was popularized by the World Bank's World Development Report 1992. 5 Stern 4 reported the development of the EKC concept in chronological order along with the theory\n"," • Global total solar energy capacity is top one among the renewables.\n"," The role of solar energy in the energy mix of Turkey is also getting more important. Do the present legislations and policy meet the requirement of circular economy of Turkey?\n"," behind the EKC, the econometric methods used in the EKC studies. The standard EKC regression model is given as following:\n"," ln(E/P) it = a i + g t + b 1 ln(GDP/P) it + b 2 (ln(GDP/P)) 2 it + 1 it where E is emissions, P is population, and ln indicates natural logarithms. The first two terms on the right-hand side are intercept parameters which vary across countries or regions i and years t as given by Stern. 4 It has been discussed that the recent developments that have change the picture of standard EKC and the many studies are ongoing about that. The CE concept that has gained much attention recently has been raised for the first time by Pearce and Turner. 6 The concept presented the interlinkages between the environment and economic activities. There are several definitions about CE presented. 7 Among these definitions, the CE is defined by European Institutions as an economy \"where the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible, and the generation of waste minimized.\" It is also worth to spread out the CE principles. For this, the governments, academia, and nongovernmental organizations, such as Ellen MacArthur Foundation, are responsible. Ellen MacArthur Foundation defined the CE as \"an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design. It replaces the \"end-of-life\" concept with restoration, shifts towards the use of renewable energy, eliminates the use of toxic chemicals, which impair reuse, and aims for the elimination of waste through the superior design of materials, products, systems, and, within this, business models.\" 8 It is obvious that moving from linear economy to CE can provide benefits such as reducing environmental pressures, improving the security of the supply of raw materials, increasing competitiveness, stimulating innovation, boosting economic growth, and creating jobs. Consequently, the CE is also helpful for strengthen national security due to the importance of sustainable energy supply. Thus, several governments including China, Japan, Canada, as well as the EU' members Germany, UK, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Finland promoted the CE concept. 7, 9 For the first time, in 1996, Germany started to the implementation of a model regarding the CE. The model only included recycle and waste management. Later, Japan developed a comprehensive legal framework for moving towards a recycling-based society. On the other hand, in 2008, China, as the first country in the world, adopted a law \"Circular Economy Promotion Law.\" 9 The 3R principles \"Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle\" mainly used by China, whereas 4R principles \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Recover\" used by the EU. 10, 11 Concerning to the CE, the EU underlines that the role of energy particularly renewables is important. One of the main goal of the EU is to increase the share of electricity generated from renewables to 20% by 2030.\n"," Several countries encourage the development of renewable resources in order to supply a secure, affordable, environment friendly and sustainable source of energy. 11 Among the energy mix, solar energy is expected to be one of the main green energy sources in the future. Within the solar energy, the solar photovoltaic (PV)-based system is one of the fastest growing clean energy technology, because the costs decrease significantly and technology developments increase. 12 According to the IEA report, the total cumulative installed capacity of PV was 627 GW at the end of 2019. 13 The solar PV technology, as well as the other clean sources, ages and degrades with time. The silicone-based PV modules have a life time of around 20-25 years. It is necessary to take care of the PV waste at the end of the life time. Since the PV installation has been growing all around the world, a special attention of industries, policy maker, and stakeholders is needed for a sustainable PV waste management concept. 12 There are lots of studies about the CE concept. Recently, the topic of renewable energy impact among the CE studies comes to front. Solar energy along with CE are mainly studied in Asia (China, Australia, and Japan), and then the EU (UK, The Netherlands, and Italy). 7 The dynamic interaction between hydroelectricity energy, renewable energy consumption, and nonrenewable energy consumption on economic growth in the E7 countries, known as emerging among the fastest growing economies in the world, over annual time frequency data from 1990 to 2018 was investigated by using Kao co-integration technique. These seven countries (China, Turkey, Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Mexico) are known as the fastest growing energy-dependent countries. As a result of the investigation, a one-way causality relationship was observed between economic growth and renewable energy, nonrenewable energy, and pollutant emission. 14 The 2009 Electricity Market and Security of Supply strategy of Turkey and the benefits of renewable energy technologies were examined from the point of the view of RE policy including legal regulations. 15 As a result of the survey on Turkish citizens' energy preferences, it was indicated that a vast majority of the citizens were against the establishment of nuclear power plant and preferred renewable energy sources thanks to their awareness of global warming and climate change. 16 It was reported that the solar PV electricity emerges as the largest contributor to cover the growing energy demand of Turkey and supply about 43.2% of total demand by 2050. 17 However, there are few studies about the importance of solar energy for the CE of Turkey. The Influence of the EU Circular Economy Action Plan on Turkey's Energy Policy and Investments in Renewables were presented. 18 The environmental benefits and economic recoveries of recycling PV module in Turkey were studied including technical aspects of engineering. 19 The lack of the literature concerning to CE policy and implementation including renewables, particularly solar energy of Turkey that is a member of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and a candidate of the EU, encourages us to work on this topic. The project of Sunrise was selected by the European Commission at the beginning of 2019 20 and supported by Horizon 2020. Mersin University in Turkey is one of the supporters for Sunrise project with the title of \"Solar Energy for a Circular Economy.\" This is also our motivation to research about the Turkey case.\n"," We present the current status of renewable energy in the global energy transformation and the energy outlook and the special position of Turkey in the OECD, and then the CE targets of the EU which are binding for Turkey. The process of Turkey's CE transition is explained along with the project of Zero Waste. Furthermore, we present the role of solar energy and recycling PV module on the path of CE. The CE developments in Turkey is discussed, and some policy suggestions are presented in conclusion for future improvement.\n"," One of the most serious concern of the 21st century is global warming that results in climate change. The energy transformation swiftly reduces the GHG emissions that cause global warming and climate change. As aforementioned above, The Paris Agreement releases a target to limit the increase of global temperature to \"well below\" 2°C, and ideally to 1.5°C, compared with pre-industrial levels, by this century. In the global energy landscape, the energy transformation from fossil-based to renewable-based energy is essential to achieve the target. The energy transformation can support wide socio-economic development with help of comprehensive policies to encourage the societies for decarbonization.\n"," According to the latest report of International Renewable Agency 21 (IRENA), the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused to crises of health, humanitarian, social, and economic, could either widen the gap between the aspiration and the reality in tackling climate change or accelerate the decarbonization of societies. In order to reduce the GHG emissions, most of the countries increase the investments of renewable energy sources. However, still much efforts have to be put on to reach zero-level emissions. Figure 1 shows the outlook of energy-related CO 2 emissions, energy demand, and fossil fuel.\n"," Renewable energy has been established globally as a mainstream source of electricity generation for several years. The global renewable energy generation capacity increased by 176 GW in 2019 and reached up to 2.537 GW at the end of 2019. 22 Among the renewables, solar energy preserved the leading capacity expansion, with an increase of 98 GW followed by wind energy with 59 GW in 2019. The growth of renewable power capacity between 2015 and 2019 is shown in Fig. 2 . In many electricity markets, the technology of solar PV and wind power are the cheapest and the installations of them are increasing. It was reported that most renewable power sources would be fully cost competitive within the next decade. 21 PV has a significant role upon an energy transition process. The annual installations of renewable energy depending on the years are presented in Fig. 3 .\n"," It is observed that the PV technology has reached an everincreasing market growth thanks to technology and cost reduction. Consequently, the PV technology has become a mainstream energy source upon the energy transition. 13 Turkey's energy outlook as a developing country 1990. 23 The population of Turkey is expected to increase up to 88.84 million in 2025 and further to 104.75 million in 2050. A decrease was observed in the rural population, while the urban population has been increasing since 1990. 23 In 2019, 92.8% of the population lived in cities and 7.2% lived in rural areas. 23 The growing population, especially in urban areas, has a significant impact on increasing the demand of housing, transport, and energy. Consequently, the GHG emissions are expected to increase depending on the growing population. 23 In 2018, the total primary energy supply was 146 Mtoe. Besides, the total energy consumption accounted for 30.49% natural gas, 30.47% oil, and 17.28% coal in 2018.\n"," The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) of Turkey informed that the electric energy capacity reached 88,550 MW at the end of 2018, generating 300 billion kWh of electricity. The renewable energy has the biggest share of the installed capacity (47.73%) followed by natural gas (24.26%) with respect to the data of Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation. 24 The share of renewable energy sources in the total capacity of Turkey was 42 GW in 2018. Concerning to renewable energy, Turkey aims to add the capacity of 20, 5, and 1 GW for wind, solar, and geothermal by 2023, respectively. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 25 the installed renewable capacity of Turkey is expected to increase by 50% reach to ∼63 GW from 2019 to 2024. One of the 2023 targets of Turkey is to generate 30% of total electric consumption from renewable sources in 2023.\n"," Turkey decided to use nuclear energy in her energy mix, although it is not a renewable source. The construction of the nuclear power plant, which is the first nuclear power plant of Turkey, Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant (Akkuyu NPP) in Akkuyu/Mersin, was started in 2010 by Russia. Akkuyu NPP has four units, 4800 MW total capacity, and the first unit is expected to operate by 2023. 26 Furthermore, Turkey plans to establish second NPP in Sinop, Black Sea region and third NNP in the Thrace site of Turkey.\n"," Turkey's \"special\" position in the OECD Turkey is a developing country with a middle income whereas she is a member of the OECD. For this reason, Turkey has a \"special\" position among the OECD members. Turkey is one of the most growing GHG emissions among the OECD members. 27 The emissions are expected to increase more than twice between 2015 and 2030 in Turkey. Although renewable energy development has been accelerated and energy efficiency was increased, the decline in emissions was less than in other members. Turkey signed the Paris Agreement in 2016. However, she has not ratified the agreement. According to the OECD, 27 Turkey needs a long-term, low-emission, and robust development strategy that will integrate climate and energy targets. Turkey, with her strong economic growth and increasing population, has the highest emission growth rate among the OECD countries for the last 10 years. 27 Turkey is the only country within the OECD members who did not submit the 2020 targets concerning to reduction of GHG emissions to the OECD. On the other hand, Turkey declared her intention to decrease a GHG emission level at a rate of 21% from business as usual by 2030 with her long-term energy strategy for Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC). 28 Turkey's GHG emissions are a major part of energy usage similar to other OECD members. Therefore, it is important to ensure the strong policies that will lead the transition to a lowcarbon economy. As it was mentioned above, the energy demand of Turkey has been increasing. The energy supply mainly depends on imports and fossil fuels. It was reported that the only one-fourth of the energy supply could meet from domestic resources. 27 Turkey has almost reached the targets of renewable energy set for 2023 in 2019 thanks to the feed-in tariff (FiT). To achieve this success, Turkey released her Renewable National Action Plan (NREAP) which was prepared according to the EU's targets in 2014. 29 The CE targets of the EU is important for Turkey. Thus, the targets are presented in the following section detail. \n"," The CE targets of the EU are binding for Turkey because of her on-going processes of full membership. The CE that is based on sharing, leasing, reuse, repair, refurbishment, and recycling has been receiving much attention instead of \"take-make-consume-throw away\" pattern of the linear economy. It is obvious that the CE implies reducing waste to a minimum and further to zero level. In addition, it has advantages for both environmental and social conditions. From the point of the view of economic benefits, it could generate a net economic benefit of €1.8 trillion by 2030. 30 It was mentioned that the EU's economy was mostly linear, with only 12% of materials recycled and brought back into the economy. 31 The CE transformation could give opportunities to the EU to reduce the pressures on the environment; to enhance security of supply of raw materials; and to increase competitiveness, innovation, growth, and jobs. 30 After the Global financial crisis in 2008, especially the resource productivity/efficiency (doing more with less) within the \"green growth\" received much more attention. Thus, a vision of a Resource Efficient Europe, as an important part of the \"Europe 2020 Strategy,\" was built up. 32 Since the beginning of 2000s, many environmental legislations and programs have been evolved due to the concerns grown in the EU. The latest one is the EU CE which is binding the economy and energy within the scope of low-carbon world. The EC adopted an ambitious Circular Economy Package in 2015, which enhances the strategy to protect environment and includes measures that will help stimulate Europe's transition towards a CE, boost global competitiveness, foster sustainable economic growth, and generate new jobs. The EU Action Plan for the CE has a concrete and ambitious program including measures from production and consumption to waste management and the market for secondary raw materials and a revised legislative proposal on waste. 33 The importance of energy and renewables to improve the efficiency and environmental performance of energy-related products are underlined in the Package. 8 Energy while defining CE was mentioned to consume and return back to the environment as waste by Charonis. 34 The new Circular Economy Action Plan 33 adopted in 2020 presents measures to:\n"," • Make sustainable products the norm in the EU; • Empower consumers and public buyers;\n"," • Focus on the sectors that use most resources and where the potential for circularity is high such as electronics and ICT; batteries and vehicles; packaging; plastics; textiles; construction and buildings; food; water and nutrients; • Ensure less waste;\n"," • Make circularity work for people, regions, and cities;\n"," • Lead global efforts on CE.\n"," To reach the EU's clean energy targets, solar power has a significant role. In 2019, a 104% increase over the 8.2 GW added the year before and the installed capacity reached to 16.7 GW. 35 The EU's target is to reach 20% share of energy from renewable sources and to use 10% of this value in the transport sector by 2020 in respect to the Europe 2020 Strategy.\n"," The PV panels were classified as \"general waste\" by most of the countries. However, for the first time, the EU adopted PV-specific waste regulations including PV-specific collection, recovery, and recycling targets. All of the panel producers for the EU market are required to finance the costs of collecting and recycling end-of-life PV panels according to the EU's directive. 36 The process of Turkey's CE transition\n"," The CE is a new production model based on sustainability and innovation, where every waste generated in a production system is recycled, so raw material costs are minimized, resource efficiency and environmental benefits are kept to a maximum.\n"," Turkey has put her efforts for CE transition since the last decade. Turkey that follows the EU's legislations has much to do on the path of the transition. The role of the public is quite important as well as the government initiatives. Thus, nongovernmental organization contributions are also important to the increase of awareness of the public. Business Council for Sustainable Development Turkey (BCSD Turkey), as a leading platform in this sense, is working in line with the United Nations' SDGs.\n"," The principle goals of the BCSD for widespread sustainability and CE development in Turkey are in following: 37 1. Transition to low-carbon economy and efficiency 2. Sustainable agriculture and access to food 3. Sustainable industry and CE\n"," It was reported that Turkey could have an opportunity to receive 15-27 billion $ (USD) of net value with the help of evolving the CE model. 18 One of the essential principles of CE is recycling municipal waste. The Turkish government has taken important steps regarding the recycling. In 2017, the first lady of Turkey, Emine Erdogan launched a Zero Waste Project in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization in order to stop resources from ending in landfill and increase public awareness about waste management. The project is compulsory for all municipalities and public and private organizations to provide a certain amount of waste separation facilities per area. In 2018, the recycling rates of municipal solid waste already increased to 15% thanks to the project. The aim of the project is to increase the recycling rate of municipal solid waste to 35% by 2023. The project also aims to reduce the usage of the plastic bags and almost 80% reduction was succeeded in 2018. 38 Turkey has launched her energy market reform for the transition to low-carbon economy and efficiency. 39 Such reforms have attracted significant private investment. The total amount of investments for electricity generation from renewable energy has exceeded 4.3 billion $ (USA) in the past 15 years. Among these investments, the solar energy has an important role.\n"," The energy demand of Turkey has been increasing quite fast compared with the OECD countries. Next, the demand is expected to be double according to IEA forecasts till 2030. Turkey has set the formulation and implementation of new policies to commission domestic and renewable energy resources due to the fact that the high rate of energy imports dependency. 40 The Government has promoted the motto of \"More Domestic, More Renewable\" and determined the following targets to strengthen renewables' position in for the energy action for the next decades. Regarding to the targets, the share of renewables has to be increased 30% of the present level by 2023. 40 Turkey has a great renewable potential, and according to IEA' estimation, she may become the fifth biggest in Europe by renewable energy capacity by 2024, and the 11th in the world.\n"," Among the renewable resources, the solar installed capacity, which is 5435 MW, will be increased up to 16,000 MW by 2027. 41 It was reported that the cost reduction had an important role on wide spreading of solar energy. The PV module prices dropped by 85% from 2010 to 2019 and further an additional drop of 71% is expected by 2050. 41 Turkey is the country to receive the most sunlight in Europe and she is one of the so-called sun-belt countries (66) (the zone receiving the highest amount of solar irradiation) identified by the European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA). Such countries have huge PV solar potential not only to supply energy to their own region, but to export energy to other parts of the world. The sun-belt countries are expected to have 1.1 TW installed solar PV capacity by 2030. 42 The sun-belt countries from low to high potentials are presented by the EPIA. 43 Solar energy can compete with conventional energy sources without any grant thanks to the cost reduction. Consequently, solar energy investments in Turkey has been increasing significantly. For the first time in 2017, Turkey took a place as the fifth largest capacity in the list announced by the IEA. 44 Top ten countries for PV installations in 2017 are given in Table 1 .\n"," The Mechanism for Supporting Renewable Energy Resources (YEKDEM) program, which started in 2011 and supported by the MENA, provided an attractive feed-in tariff scheme for renewable power projects. The YEKDEM program will be expired at the end of 2020. Thus, in order to encourage the development and use of domestic manufacture of equipment required for large-scale renewable energy generation facilities, Turkey adopted the Regulation on Renewable Energy Resource Area scheme (YEKA) in 2016. 45 Turkey's PV capacity and recycling Solar energy has an important role upon the low-carbon energy transition due to the climate change problem. From the point of the view of solar energy market, the PV solar module installations are growing quite fast. The crystalline Si module share is 85-90% among the PV panel technologies. 46 Each module has a lifetime which means increasing the installation of the modules increases the waste of modules expected to reach up to 5.5-6 million tons by 2050. For the CE model, the recycling of the PV modules is important. Consequently, methods for recycling PV modules have been developed worldwide in order to reduce the environmental impact of PV waste and to recover some of the value from old modules. 46 Turkey as a sun-belt country is among the largest developing solar markets and she has a share of 6.5% (91.26 GW in 2019) solar capacity within power generation capacity. Turkey's total solar energy installed capacity between 2014 and 2019 and the expected capacity depending on low and high scenarios are presented in Fig. 4 .\n"," The 169.7 MW capacity is supplied with the licensed PV projects under the support of the government. Besides, the unlicensed PV systems have 5,826 MW in total solar capacity. 48 The unlicensed PV systems are quite popular under 1 MW capacity because of the advantage of the unlicensed (FiT) schemes. 39 Turkey's PV capacity in total solar energy (2008-2018) is shown in Fig. 5 . Figure 6 shows the PV contribution, which is theoretically calculated to the electricity demand in several countries based on the PV capacity installed by the end of 2019. Honduras having 14.8% is on top of the list. Turkey with a theoretical penetration level of 5.1% was higher than that of the EU level (4.9%) and also the world level (3.0%). 13 It is estimated that Turkey's rooftop PV installation capacity is approximately 15 GW more than twice that of Turkey's current installed solar power. 49 Thanks to raising awareness of Turkish society about green energy, the PV market has grown in all dimensions from production to installation. 50 It is obvious that PV systems upon the operation phase (25-30 years) do not produce any GHG emissions. However, the impact of total environment must be taken into account throughout its entire lifecycle. It was mentioned that recycling the end-of-life PV modules could significantly reduce the energy consumption and carbon emission, and alleviate lifecycle resource depletion. 51 Turkey's total module number was reported as 3.3 million in 2018 by Gönen and Kaplanoglu. 19 The 60-70% of these modules are assumed to be recycled, whereas 30-40% of the remaining modules are assumed nonrecycled or already they deinstalled before their end of life due to the lack of regulation related to the PV recycle. In this context, once the recycle ratio of PV modules in Turkey was selected as 65%, the recycled metals' economic value would be approximately 30 million $ (USD). 19 The legislations concerning to PV waste were included in the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) of the EU in 2012. 52 In 2015, Turkey adopted the WEEE, whereas the PV modules are not officially accepted as electronic waste. The current system in Turkey is still insufficient to meet the collection and treatment targets given in the WEEE Regulation. It is important to classify the PV modules as electronic waste and also define the criteria of the recycling process.\n"," The CE policy has accelerated significantly since the last two decades all around the world. The CE policies started to be implied in the 2000s, whereas the concept of the CE has already been known since 1970s. Recently, the CE concept has been growing quite fast not only in developed countries but also in developing countries including Turkey. On the way of the CE, Turkey as a candidate country of the EU has drawn a road map in accordance with the EU's legislations. Such efforts of Turkey on this path are also helpful to meet the OECD's targets.\n"," Turkey is conscious of the importance of CE and the need of energy transition. Thus, Turkey has increased the renewable investments since 2000s and reduced the import dependency. The growing rate of renewable energy investments in Turkey brings a new issue, which is \"recycling.\" The Zero Waste Project of Turkey is helpful particularly for municipal waste recycling. However, Turkey has to define a comprehensive legal infrastructure regarding the recycling process of electronic waste including PV modules.\n"," Turkey has a much higher solar energy potential than the UK and Germany, which are the leading countries in this field. The rate of the investments regarding PV power has been increasing in Turkey. The lifetime is expected to expire and makes encounter problems in 2040s. Within the green economy process, the recycling of these PV panels is quite important. To benefit from that (e.g., achieving a sufficient sustainable industry, economy, and clean environment), Turkey should increase the effort for CE and complete the legislations as soon as possible. For this, the EU countries that are already started to the CE, particularly Germany, may play a role model for Turkey.\n"," Adding the priority of CE with \"More Circular\" vision into the policy of \"More Domestic, More Renewable\" will be helpful for economic development, supplying the grown energy demand, and reducing GHG emissions of Turkey. \n","Score: 1.5233396850289702\n","\n","Title: A Brave New World: Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality in Systems Biology HHS Public Access\n","Body Text: Oculus Rift (Menlo Park, CA), HTC VIVE (Taiwan), and PlayStation VR (San Mateo, CA), have enabled VR to finally have good enough performance at relatively cheaper prices, creating a positive feedback loop between companies that develop more advanced technologies and expanding consumer demand, which led to a tremendous jump in VR technology (Wohlgenannt et al., 2020; Kugler, 2021) . For context, commercial VR systems in 2016 required expensive and difficult setups including an HMD headset, controllers, and sensors connected to an external high-graphics computer. However, some current new generation VR sets such as Oculus Quest 2 (Menlo Park, CA) and HTC VIVE Focus series (Taiwan), generally referred as stand-alone VR systems, or all-in-one solutions, do not even depend on any external computer system (Wohlgenannt et al., 2020) , increasing accessibility further. Coupled with very recent developments such as the popular metaverse concept that combines multiple elements of VR/AR and internet technologies to achieve an extended reality by blending physical and digital worlds together (Lee et al., 2021) , we anticipate that VR/AR technologies will finally go mainstream.\n"," In systems biology, we often seek to provide new insights that weave data on molecules, pathways, cells and tissues to whole organisms, populations, and ecosystems in multiple time-and length-scales. Furthermore, new high-throughput-omics experimental techniques are producing massive and diverse multi-omics datasets (Gillette et al., 2020; Kalayci et al., 2020; Petralia et al., 2020; Marx, 2021; Satpathy et al., 2021) , and detailed data capture is boosted further by advances in supercomputers and tracking sensor technologies. Parallel increases in processor speeds and data storage enable computational analyses of these data (Schadt et al., 2010) . New or updated visualization technologies are needed to explore and communicate these datasets. While not new in scientific visualizations (Bryson, 1996; Simpson et al., 2000) , VR technologies offer novel avenues to these unprecedented new data communication needs. However, much remains to be answered on when and how to use VR/AR technologies in systems biology.\n"," To help answer these questions for different use cases, we first provide a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of using VR technologies in Table 2 . Notably, their greatest advantage is in providing unparalleled presence-the sense of being inside of and interacting with the virtual environment (Slater and Wilbur, 1997; Schubert et al., 2001; Sutcliffe et al., 2005) . Therefore, we recommend utilizing VR/AR technologies when spatial presence and immersive interactivity with the content makes a difference in addressing user needs. User comprehension may become somewhat limited in 2D above domain-specific data type and size thresholds, leading to data occlusions. In such cases, immersion enables 3D-navigation and provides the necessary perceptive depth to enhance comprehension. For example, for multi-dimensional data, user studies have reported significantly better performance for immersive 3D vs. 2D environments for certain analysis tasks (Etemadpour et al., 2013) . As researchers working at the interface of biology and data visualization, based on our own experience in this domain, and observations on the general trends in VR applications in biology that we briefly summarize here, we anticipate their utilization in three main areas in systems biology: 1) visually exploring and communicating data; 2) performing virtual experiments; and 3) education/teaching and discuss them below.\n"," Systems biology visualizations are generally abstract representations, far from real-world objects. For instance, cellular pathway graphs are often cartoon representations. Yet, they suffice in helping understand the biological phenomena they represent. In VR environments, users interpret such abstractions as real objects, and the imagery has a lasting impact on our brains. Furthermore, we can interact with the virtual objects in ways that are not possible in the real world at multiple scales, from single molecules (Leinen et al., 2015) , protein-drug complexes (Norrby et al., 2015) biomolecular networks (Liluashvili et al., 2017) to organs (Mirhosseini et al., 2014) ; navigate through them (Bellmund et al., 2016) , or dynamics (Nakano et al., 2016) . VR technologies thus open the door to benefit diverse phenomena that involve 3D spatial reconstructions, from localizations and dynamics in the human brain (Calì et al., 2016) to interactions in retinal pathology (Aaker et al., 2011) and volumetric studies in digital pathology (Farahani et al., 2016; Liimatainen et al., 2021) . More recently, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) in immersive VR has been used to visualize biological structures as point clouds at the molecular scale (e.g., vLUME by Spark et al., 2020) . Some of these recent SMLM tools can be further extended to other similarly multidimensional spatially localized point clouds (e.g., Genuage tool by Blanc et al., 2020) .\n"," In systems biology, the knowledge, visualization, and exploration of related 3D structural data often play an important role. To explore and understand the function of macromolecules (proteins, RNA, and DNA) and their complexes from their 3D structural models, molecular graphics is shifting to VR (Tse et al., 2011; Nakano et al., 2016; Ratamero et al., 2018; Cassidy et al., 2020; Todd and Emsley, 2021) . Some of these applications further integrate relevant structural knowledge with domain-specific (Norrby et al., 2015) , or genomics datasets (Zhang et al., 2019) . While some molecular viewers work in CAVE environments (Block et al., 2009) , others utilize latest HMDs (Leinen et al., 2015) , game engines such as Unity and gesture devices such as Kinect and Leap Motion (Probst and Reymond, 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) or even voice recognition (Sabir et al., 2013) to activate commands; or provide web-based VR without head-tracking or advanced interactions (Li et al., 2014; Cassidy et al., 2020) . Parallel efforts are also on-going to study the chemical fingerprints of DrugBank compounds in VR environments (Probst and Reymond, 2018) .\n"," VR is useful even when exploring abstract systems-level data that do not contain 3Dlocalizations. For example, researchers often employ complex network visualizations which may require many viewpoints due to clutter, and navigation issues. Several studies suggest stereoscopy alone (Ware and Mitchell, 2008; Greffard et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Kwon et al., 2016) or combined with rotation (Sollenberger and Milgram, 1993) or motion cues (Ware and Mitchell, 2008) enhances performance in comprehension, helps present graphs better than 2D-displays (Sollenberger and Milgram, 1993) and enables low user error rates (Ware and Mitchell, 2008) . For example, Supplementary Figure S1 shows a relatively large network in 2D, and Supplementary Video S1 in 3D. While both are generated using the network visualization tool iCAVE (Liluashvili et al., 2017; Kalayci and Gümüş, 2018) , within iCAVE users can further interactively explore the 3D or stereo versions from multiple perspectives. Visualizations from multiple perspectives reportedly make different aspects of a system more salient (Ellis et al., 1991) . Similarly, the BigTop tool (Westreich et al., 2020) renders Manhattan plots from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 3D.\n"," More recently, VR is used to explore multidimensional -omics datasets in systems biology including cytometry, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and their combinations, in the form of abstract data clouds. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis often includes a dimensionality reduction step, where cell populations are projected in 2D or 3D space to explore cellular heterogeneity. Visualizing such datasets in 3D can be more informative as it decreases the possibility of collapsing similar cell types and clusters. A recent tool, CellexalVR, allows visual exploration and analysis of such dimensionality reduction plots and associated metadata in immersive VR (Legetth et al., 2021) . Other tools for the same purpose include starmapVR (Yang et al., 2020) , singlecellVR (Stein et al., 2021) and Theia (Bressan et al., 2021) . These platforms often include additional modalities such as on-the-fly clustering, or visualization of dynamic changes in RNA velocity. While singlecellVR and starmapVR are web applications that enable visualizations using low-cost and easily available VR hardware such as Google Cardboard (Yang et al., 2020; Stein et al., 2021) , CellexalVR involves GPU-accelerated performance and in-session on-the-fly calculations. StarmapVR further enables simultaneous visualization of spatial transcriptomics data from matching histological images. We anticipate that in the near future we will witness further developments in VR tools for the visual exploration of spatial transcriptomics datasets.\n"," For research studies that cannot be performed in the real world, VR provides a safe, standardized, and reproducible environment that is as life-like as possible (Tarr and Warren, 2002) . In addition, we can break the laws of optics and physics, or disconnect real life sensed by the user's body from the world the user is experiencing (Tarr and Warren, 2002) . Researchers have been using such VR properties to study, modify or enhance behavior. For example, neural processes research that links biology and behavior in different species, from insects to humans (Ravassard et al., 2013; Aghajan et al., 2015; Acharya et al., 2016) has used VR to help understand sensory cues that carry information on the virtual worlds or refine the rules that link a subject's actions to changes in their world. In addition to assisting in understanding human behavior, research can in turn inform how VR environments can be improved in design for increased human engagement. For example, studies suggest that the socially networked nature of VR should be considered in tool design, as numbers of remote users in virtual spaces increase (Kruzan and Won, 2019; Jeong et al., 2021) .\n"," In systems biology, virtual experiments can help develop and improve scientific thinking skills. Virtual reformulations of experiments in the form of games to be solved have already proven efficiency in tackling scientific problems. For example, the tools Foldit (Foldit, 2022) and Eterna (Eterna, 2022) have gamified the protein folding and RNA structure prediction problems (Das et al., 2019) , and thereby enabled more individuals to perform virtual experiments by engaging the online gaming community whose members may have little to no scientific knowledge. Yet, these gamers have successfully solved real-world problems in relatively short time scales (Cooper et al., 2010; Khatib et al., 2011; Eiben et al., 2012; Horowitz et al., 2016; Koepnick et al., 2019) . Similarly, the tool EyeWire has gamified mapping neural circuits in the brain to understand vision, where players try to virtually map 3D neuron structures to serial electron microscopy image data from animal brains (Das et al., 2019; EyeWire, 2022) . This game has so far attracted more than 150 K gamers who helped reveal 6 new neuron types and many undiscovered brain circuits (EyeWire Into the Brain, 2022). VR environments open exciting new possibilities of such gamification of virtual scientific problems both for scientists with little coding experience, as well as for non-scientists, and the communication between these two communities. We have already started to observe the first examples of such tools in computational chemistry, where Shannon et al have introduced molecular dynamics VR game to encourage users to explore the reactivity of a specific chemical system (Shannon et al., 2021) , and an intuitive VR platform called Nanome presented by Kingsley et al., where the users explore and modify chemical structures collaboratively to work on structural biology and molecular drug design problems (Kingsley et al., 2019) . The next several years will witness an increasing number of tools that gamify virtual experiments in the VR environments. Note that in online gaming communities, VR is increasingly blended with social media functionalities, and thus gamified systems biology VR tools will likely need to consider such additional functionalities that are critical for remote users.\n"," VR environments can help learning in systems biology areas that involve complex 3D information (Salzman et al., 1999; Mikropoulos and Natsis, 2011) , user-interactivity and/or high computational skills. For example, understanding protein structure traditionally involves physical modeling kits or projections of the 3D structures into 2D. However, the ability to create, alter, and rotate a chemical structure in real time in 3D can make it easier to understand abstract concepts (Limniou et al., 2008) . Similarly, annotated 3D web-based anatomy atlases help teach complex structures such as artery networks or bronchial trees. Earlier interactive 3D-renderings of these systems used desktops with standard screens due to the costs of VR processors and displays (Li et al., 2012) , while later technologies have enabled stereoscopic immersive 3D with real-time interactivity (Kockro et al., 2007) . Randomized user studies show that stereo-enhanced 3D-tools are useful in learning anatomy and are well-received by students (Kockro et al., 2015; de Faria et al., 2016) . Similarly, integrating AR technology reportedly has positive impact on student learning in biology (Weng et al., 2020) .\n"," Recent technological advances in VR have substantially increased their potential utility in learning. Biological concepts currently constitute ~5% of academic publications on VR (Morimoto and Ponton, 2021) . Relatively popular educational platforms include those that simulate biological and chemical experiments within VR environments, such as VRLab Academy (United Kingdom), Labster (Denmark), and ClassVR (United Kingdom). Advances in gaming have expanded VR applications in education as well. For example, the tool Peppy provides a Unity-based VR gaming engine to understand protein structures and their dynamics in undergraduate biochemistry classes (Doak et al., 2020) . Similarly, Pepblock Builder VR tool provides a gamified interface for researchers who are not advanced in the computational skills required for protein design (Yallapragada et al., 2021) .\n"," Many educational VR experiences exist in popular gaming platforms that recreate biological systems, such as The Body VR, where players move in the bloodstream to observe human cells and learn how organelles function (The Body VR LLC, 2016) , and InCell VR, where players fight to stop a virus invasion in human, while learning about cell and organelle microstructures (Luden.io, 2015) . We anticipate that gaming-based VR tools will similarly be developed for learning multi-omics datasets at a systems level. Further research will then be necessary to understand the full potential impact of VR in learning systems biology.\n"," The recent explosion in VR/AR technologies has coincided with extended work-from-home practices due to the coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic. These developments have lowered resistance to virtual technologies and in fact created a pressing need for virtual, collaborative workspaces in research. Coupled with the explosive increase in datasets collected from multi-omics high-throughput experiments, VR/AR technologies offer attractive new opportunities for visual data exploration and communication in systems biology. However, to develop the most useful tools, systems biologists need to conduct their own user studies and get familiar with design practices within virtual spaces for improved human perception (Cleveland and McGill, 1987) . With deeper understandings of the brain and visual perception, content creation and best practices will be established, and adoption will increase. Further technological improvements (higher frame rates, efficient information storage and rendering; increased data transfer with less bit rates; game engines; graphics cards) will aid challenging visualizations such as dynamic networks or multi-scale systems, integrated with data annotations and on-the-fly calculations. Visualization outcomes will in turn guide future research protocols.\n"," VR application development is already easier with HMDs and input devices that offer game engine-compatible free software development kits. These render information from internetworked devices that collect and exchange data with sensors and network connections (Rose, 2014; Akyildiz et al., 2015; Open Hybrid, 2022) or from integrating multiple technologies (e.g., healthcare in cyberspace (Rosen et al., 2016) ). We anticipate that new technologies will further eliminate discomforts and limitations of modern VR headsets such as their bulkiness and weight. Towards this end, current studies include using skin sensory interfaces, such as nanowire-based soft wearable HMIs , and thin and light-weight holographic optics with high performance sunglasses-like near-eye full-color displays, as developed by Facebook Reality Labs (Maimone and Wang, 2020) . Such new technologies may remove the barriers between the virtual and real worlds further by eliminating headset use, thereby converging VR/AR (Kugler, 2021) .\n"," In summary, we are currently at a critical juncture for VR/AR use in systems biology, as they are finally on the verge of going mainstream. We anticipate that the current trends towards utilizing low-cost VR/AR systems will continue. Still, for certain research areas, interactive 3D applications in Web3D will likely suffice. For some applications, AR will be preferable, as it allows users to overlap virtual data onto the real world in relatively simpler set-ups such as smartphones, without the need of HMDs, and provide more control of their surroundings (Garcia-Bonete et al., 2019) . VR will likely remain advantageous in applications that require better immersion and realism (Garcia-Bonete et al., 2019) . Barriers for access to VR/AR visualizations in systems biology will likely remain, however, for researchers from underdeveloped countries, and which will need to be addressed. At the same time, with the increasing trends in gamification within the VR environments (Shannon et al., 2021) , barriers for scientists with low computational expertise and nonscientists in conducting their own virtual experiments will decrease. As user community grows and commercial VR/AR technologies expand, we expect the range of their systems biology applications will also continue to grow, opening possibilities for significant advancements in understanding and communicating disease-associated mechanisms, running virtual experiments, and education, and help boost the development of new therapies. Of course, the best way to gauge possibilities is to explore them!\n"," Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n"," This study was supported by the Concern Foundation Conquer Cancer Now award and Cancer Moonshot R33 award # CA263705-01 to ZG.\n"," The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n"," Page 14 \n"," Track user position (x, y, z) coordinates and orientation (yaw, pitch, roll angles) as users move about (either all or some) \"User position\" may be body movements, head-rotations, or gestures Feed tracking information back to the computer for real-time display updates (e.g., 3D mouse (wand) or data gloves) Types Generally use 3D computer vision, sync pulses and laser lines, or inertial measurement units to recognize movements, gestures and positioning to achieve intuitive tracking Full-body Tracking \n","Score: 1.51130286105128\n","\n","Title: Modeling of a Speed Control System Using Event-B\n","Body Text: The case study, proposed in the context of the ABZ2020 conference, is composed of two parts: Adaptive Exterior Light and Speed Control Systems. Since the whole case study is quite lengthy/complex and the two parts are only loosely coupled as stated in the description document, we chose to handle each part in a separate paper. The present paper deals with the speed control system whereas a companion paper considers the adaptive exterior light system [7] .\n"," The goal of the speed control system is to regulate the current speed of a car according to a set of criteria like the speed desired by the driver, the position of a possible preceding vehicle but also a given speed limit that the driver must not exceed. The system can behave according to two options: the first one regulates the speed independently on the any preceding vehicle, the second component takes into account the position of a possible preceding vehicle by maintaining a safety distance. The driver has the possibility to choose which option to activate at a given moment. Like a controller, in both options, the system reads different informations from the available sensors (key state, desired speed, the preceding vehicle position, etc.) and takes the adequate actions by acting on the actuators of the car's speed according to the read information.\n"," The present paper describes the formal modeling of the speed control system using the Event-B method and its refinement technique that permits to master the complexity of a system by gradually introducing its different elements/characteristics. Proposed by Abrial as a successor of the B method [1] , the Event-B method [2] permits to model discrete systems using mathematical notations. An Event-B specification is made of two elements: context and machine. A context describes the static part of an Event-B specification; it consists of constants and sets (user-defined types) together with axioms that specify their properties. The dynamic part is included in a machine that defines variables and a set of events. The possible values that the variables can hold are specified by an invariant using a first-order formula on the state variables. The different machines composing an Event-B specification are related with a refinement relation whereas the contexts are linked with an extension link (extends). Each refinement adds new information to a model; these could be new state variables, new events or new properties. Event-B refinement allows for guard strengthening, nondeterminism reduction, and new events introduction. New events of a model M that refines a model M are considered to refine a skip event of M , hence they cannot modify a variable of M . Therefore, all events that need to modify a variable v must be defined in the same model where v is first introduced. The correctness of an Event-B model is ensured by proof obligations that verify that the invariant is preserved by each event and that the refinement preserves the properties of the system.\n"," The development of our Event-B models has been done under the Rodin platform [3] that provides editors, provers and several other plugins for various tasks like animation and model checking with ProB [5] . We use ProB in order to animate the built models with two purposes: exhibiting the problematic scenarios that violate the invariant prior to the hard/long proof phase, but also validating the specification by playing the provided scenarios in order to be sure that we have specified the right system. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our modelling strategy. Section 3 describes our model in more details. Section 4 describes the validation and verification of our model. Section 5 identifies the weaknesses of the requirements document provided for the case study, and the adequacy of the Event-B method for constructing a model of this case study. We conclude in Sect. 6.\n"," The speed control system subject of this paper can be seen as a control system that interacts with its environment through a set of sensors, which provide it with information about the state of the physical elements, and a set of actuators that are used to transmit the adequate orders to these elements. In this paper, we use the concepts described in [10] . A sensor measures the value of some environment elements m, called a monitored variable (e.g., the state of the ignition key), and provides this measure (e.g., whether the key is inserted or not) to the software controller as an input variable i. The software controller can influence the environment by sending commands, called output variable o to actuators. An actuator influences the value of some characteristics of the environment, call a controlled variable c. Variables m and c are called environment variables. Variables i and o are called controller variables. Finally, a controller has its own internal state variables to perform computations. In this case study, we use Event-B state variables to represent both environment and controller variables. We do not model sensor or actuator failures.\n"," A well-known architecture of a control system is a control loop that reads all input variables at once, at a given moment, and then computes all output variables in the same iteration. But, it can be also viewed as a continuous system that can be interrupted by any change in the environment represented by a new value sent by a sensor. In this paper, we see the controller as a distributed system; each sub-system is associated to a given sensor. In that case, the system reacts to each single modification of the sensor. This approach can be seen as a more abstract approach, as it is common in the Event-B style of system modeling. We define one event for each input variable change, which allows for a more modular specification that is easier to prove. This is closer to an interrupt-driven control system. Our Event-B abstraction is also a reasonable abstraction for a control loop, considering that in most cases, a single input variable changes between two control loop iterations. The control loop can be derived from our specification by merging all events and defining priorities between events.\n"," This section briefly describes the main modeling elements that characterize our specification. The complete archive of the Event-B project is available in [6] . Let us note that the development of our model (Event-B components, proofs, animation, etc.) took about two months including the different exchanges with the authors of the case study. Our model contains 4 contexts and 4 machines/refinements. Table 1 relates the components of our model with the requirements listed in [4] . As one can remark, some requirements are modelled as invariants whereas others are dealt with in the adequate events. We chose to do not model some requirements as invariants because this would make the modeling and the proof activities more complex and difficult. Requirement SCS-41 for example: \". . . the self-test of the radar system is restarted every 10 min\" is modeled by a variable nextTest that is set to the current time plus 10 min in the events that represent the movement of the key and the progression of the time because the self-test of the radar system should be performed at the start (the key is in the ignition position) and then every 10 min. Modeling this requirement as an invariant would require the introduction of two extra variables to store the moments of two consecutive self-test activities, then we have to state that 10 min should be elapsed between these two moments.\n"," Machine M 0 models the current speed of the studied car independently from any preceding vehicle and also without giving any condition on its evolution. This machine defines the following unique invariant:\n"," where rangeSpeed denotes a constant defined in the context C0 to set the range values for the speed (rangeSpeed = 0..5000). Machine M 0 defines a unique event updateV ehicleSpeed to set the current speed of the car as follows:\n"," Machine M 1 introduces the physical elements that are manipulated by the driver and that have an impact on the current speed of the car. These elements include gas/brake pedal, key, cruise control lever, etc. Machine M 1 describes how the position of each of these elements evolves depending on its current position. In this same machine, we also introduce the event progress that makes the current time keep progressing. Machine M 2 models the desired speed together with the activation of the normal/adaptive cruise control and also the traffic sign detection that has an impact on the value of the desired speed according to the requirements (SCS-36,SCS-39). It is worth noting that some events, like that related to the traffic sign detection, are introduced in M 1 even if this aspect is really dealt with in Machine M 2. Indeed, these events need to modify some variables that are introduced in M 1 and, as noted before, a new event cannot modify a variable defined in a previous refinement level. Machine M 3 specifies the different aspects that depend on or impact the desired/current speed like speed-dependent safety distance that also depends on the speed of the preceding vehicle but also the faults that can happen on the radar system. The main elements of these Event-B components are described hereafter.\n"," This machine refines Machine M0 by introducing the different elements that impact the current speed of the car. This includes the physical elements that Table 1 . Cross-reference between the components of our model and the requirements of [4] Requirements [4] Component Invariant/event\n"," SCS-3, SCS-12, SCS-13, SCS-16, SCS-17, SCS-31\n"," inv6 and inv7\n"," Not covered since no information is given on how the system reaches/ maintain the desired speed \n"," Not covered since the light system is not included the driver manipulates, the radar system that gives the distance to the nearest obstacle but also the time progression since it makes some variables evolve like the desired speed. For that purpose, several variables/invariants are introduced to model how the position of the physical elements evolves depending on its current position. In this paper, we give details about the radar the system, the time progression and also the cruise control lever. The state of the radar system is modelled by a Boolean variable rangeRadarState. This variable is initialized to FALSE since the ignition is Off at the beginning then its state is updated each 10 min. Therefore, we define a variable nextT est to store the moment of the next radar system self-test. These variables are defined by the following invariants:\n"," where KeyState is a variable representing the position of the key ({N oKeyInserted, KeyInserted, KeyInIgnitionOnP osition}). This invariant expresses that the state of the radar system is checked 10 min after the state (keyState = KeyInIgnitionOnP osition). Let us remark the value of 6000 is equal to (10 × 600) since we choose a progression time step of a tenth of a second because some data in the case study are with 0.1 precision as depicted by the following progress event that models the time progression: .\n"," Guard grd1 specifies that when the time progresses to the next self-test moment (nextT est = currentT ime + 1) and the stating of the system (keyState = KeyInIgnitionOnP osition), the state of the radar system is chosen randomly (rdstate ∈ BOOL) otherwise its state remains the same (radstate = rangeRadarState in grd2).\n"," Similarly, cruise control lever is modeled by the variable SCSLeverU D and its typing invariant: SCSLeverU D ∈ SCSLeverP ositions where SCSLeverP ositions is a given set defined in Context C1 seen by M 1 : For each of these elements, invariants are defined in Machine M 1 to specify the authorized position changes together with the event that models them. The following invariant states that the cruise control level cannot directly move from an Upward position to a Downward position bypassing the Neutral position. As we can remark, the above invariant uses an extra variable SCSLeverU DP to model the previous position of the cruise control level. In the next section, we show that this kind of variables is also relevant for modeling some requirements that need to make reference to the current and previous states of the system.\n"," Machine M 1 defines event moveSCSLeverUD that models the cruise control level movements where grd2 permits to make the invariant preserved after the observation of this event: \n"," This machine describes how the desired speed evolves according to the requirements (SCS-1 to SCS-12) by moving the cruise control level into different positions. We also model the activation of the normal/adaptive cruise control as described in the document. In addition, we specify the speed limit requirements (SCS-29 to SCS-34) because the calculation of the current speed must respect such a limit.\n"," Mainly, this machine introduces some additional variables to model the desired speed (desiredSpeed) and the normal/adaptive cruise control (normContr and adapContr) with their associated variables to represent their previous values. For instance, the following invariant defines the activation of the normal cruise control:\n"," The invariant states that, if the normal mode is selected for the cruise control and the brake pedal is not activated, the normal cruise control is activated the first time when the cruise control level moves to the forward position while the current speed is greater than 200 km/h and or the desired speed is not null and remains activated as long as the cruise control level is not put in the Backward position.\n"," To model the desired speed whose evolution depends on the time, we store the last time (lastT imeSCSLeverU D) when the cruise control level has been in the Up/down positions. Thus requirements SCS-4 and SCS-7 are modeled as follows. Requirement SCS-4 specifies that, while the cruise control is activated, the desired speed increases by 1 the first time the cruise control level is put in position Upward5 whereas Requirement SCS-7 states that the desired speed continues to increase by 1 by each second as long as the cruise control level stays in that position for more than 2 s. Variable lastdesiredSpeed represents the desired speed when the lever has been moved into a given position.\n"," Let us give more explanation about the last invariant. Expression (currentT ime − lastT imeSCSLeverU D − 10) permits to update the desired speed immediately after 2 s, this is why we subtract 10 units of time and not 20. As stated before, as we chose a progression step of tenth of a second, we must divide by 10 each data related to the time. To make these invariants preserved, we have refined the moveSCSLeverUD event according to Requirement SCS-4 but also the progress event with respect to Requirement SCS-7. Event progress for instance is refined by adding the following guard that calculates the new desired speed:\n"," The above guard distinguishes different cases according to the position of the control lever and the time elapsed since its last position change(currentT ime + 1 − lastT imeSCSLeverU D ≥ 20). The term (currentT ime + 1) denotes the after-value of currentT ime when Event progress is observed. The following cases have been distinguished:\n"," 1. if the time elapsed from the last movement of the lever is less than 2 s then, the desired speed does not change (case 1), otherwise 2. if the lever is at the Upward5 position, the desired speed increases by 1 every second (10 × tenth of a second): SCS-7, case 2. otherwise the lever is in the Upward7 position and the desired speed increases to the next ten's place after each 2 s: SCS-8, case 3. 3. if the lever is at the Downward5 position, the desired speed decreases by 1 every second (10 × tenth of a second): SCS-9, case 4. otherwise the lever is in the Upward7 position and the desired speed increases to the next ten's place after each 2 s: SCS-10, case 5.\n"," Let us note that the Event-B method and its underlying language is not well-adapted to model the evolution of the speed vehicle according to its acceleration/speed and the time passing. Indeed, since the language does not support real numbers, we model the current speed as an integer amount that evolves according to the usual equation (V = γ × t + V p ) where the γ represents the acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle, (t = 1) the time progression and V p the previous speed. As our time progression is by a tenth of a second, the progression of the speed is very small, that is, less than one kilometer. This progression can not be taken into account using the B language. To overcome such a limit, we proceed as follows. We do not include the increasing/decreasing of the current speed in the event that makes the time progress but we introduce a new event setSpeed that sets the current speed to a given value. This also permits to play and produce the scenarios provided in the case study. Another alternative to overcome the lack of reals in the Event-B language is to define or reuse an existing theory plugin that models them [11] . However, this will make the development and the proofs more complex since the interactive prover of Rodin does not adequately support such a concept, that it a proof that uses a theory can not be saved.\n"," In this level, we model the different aspects that depend on or impact the desired/current speed, like speed-dependent safety distance and the speed of the preceding vehicle. Moreover, we model the faults that can happen on the radar system. Machine M 3 introduces two new events turnHead and VehicHeadDetect to model respectively the selection of a safety level by turning the cruise control lever head and the detection of a preceding vehicle by catching its speed that is relevant for determining the speed-dependent safety distance and also to make the system decelerates if it is necessary. Event VehicHeadDetect for instance is specified as follows: \n"," Event parameter val represents the distance between the studied car and a possible preceding vehicle as provided by the radar. Guard grd2 states that such a value should be equal to 255 if the radar system is not ready. Guards grd4-grd7 permit to calculate the new value for the speed-dependent safety distance according to the requirements SCS-23 and SCS-24 with the event parameter speh denoting the speed of the preceding vehicle.\n"," Already existing events of M 2 are refined in M 3 in similar way by calculating the value of the different variables. For instance, the desired speed should be updated when a traffic sign is detected, the speed-dependent safety distance is updated when the current speed is modified or the speed of a preceding vehicle changes. More details can be found in [6] .\n"," To ensure the correctness and validate the built Event-B models, we have proceeded into three steps detailed hereafter.\n"," We used the ProB tool as a model checker in order to ensure that all the invariants of each machine are preserved after the observation of each event, that is, there is no sequence of events that makes an invariant not satisfied. Basically, when an invariant becomes violated, ProB exhibits such a sequence of events that, starting from a valid initial state of the machine, leading to a state that violates the related invariant. Such specification errors can be due to a guard/action missing, to an incorrect specification of the invariant but sometimes also to an incorrect property, that is the system really does not satisfy the property. Let us note that even if no invariant violation is found by the tool, there may still exist scenarios that violate the invariant that the tool cannot find due to their complexity or/and the timeout on the model checking process. This is why a proof phase should be performed to ensure that the specification is invariant-violation free.\n"," This step aims at verifying that we have built the right model whose behaviors conform to the desired ones as described by the scenarios of the specification document. For that purpose, the animation capability of ProB is used to play the different scenarios provided in the case study. This step allows us to point out some flaws/ambiguities in the initial release of the description document. For instance, the initial examples provided to illustrate the requirements SCS-5-SCS-9 were incorrect with respect to the requirements. In addition, in some place like SCS-7-SCS-9, the term \"target speed\" is used instead of \"desired speed\", etc. All these aspects have been discussed with the case study authors because we are not specialists of the domain. Let us note that we have faced some difficulties to play the provided scenarios since no information is provided on how the controller calculates the acceleration at each step. So, we have made our best to \"simulate\" these values without any representation about their suitability, reliability.\n"," This last phase aims at ensuring the correctness of the specification by discharging all the proof obligations generated by Rodin to prove that the invariants are preserved by each event, but also that the guard of each refined event is stronger than that of the abstract one. Figure 1 provides the proof statistics of the case study: 579 proof obligations have been generated, of which 60% (345) were automatically proved by the various provers. The remaining proof obligations were discharged interactively since they needed the use of external provers like the Mono Lemma prover that has shown to be very useful for arithmetic formulas even if we had to add some theorems on min/max operators (a min/max of a finite set is an element of the set, etc) but also on the transitivity property of the comparison operator (≥, ≤, etc.).\n"," This section reports on some points about the choices made during the Event-B modeling of the speed control system.\n"," The formal modeling of the specification document [4] lead us to question ourselves about the semantics of some requirement and identify a number of ambiguities and some contradictions with the test scenarios provided. Being not specialist of the domain, we have communicated these to the authors of the requirements document, and a number of revisions were produced, following our comments. Our discussion and exchange lead to the modification/revision of a set of requirements to make them clearer and consistent. A detailed list of these elements are described in the last version (i.e., 1.17) of the requirements document: As already well-known, the use of a formal method does not only permit to built a correct system but it also allows to make the requirement document clearer and precise by removing ambuities and errors.\n"," As stated before, a number of requirements refer to the current and previous state of an element. In order to be able to verify these requirements using a proof strategy, we modeled them as invariants by introducing two variables for each element to store their current and previous values. The obtained specification is quite cumbersome especially that we have to add for each event that does not modify a variable that its previous value is equal to its current value. We think that it would be interesting to investigate existing tools/approaches that could help us specify this kind of properties in a simpler manner. An example of such tools is the Event-B State machines plugin 1 that produces Event-B events from a state machine including their guards that specify the requirements modeled by the state machine but without producing the related invariants. This plugin makes difficult to trace and justify the usefulness of the generated guards.\n"," This paper presents a formal modeling proposal of a speed control system using the Event-B method. We have modelled most of requirements that permits us to point out some ambiguities in the requirements that we have discussed and clarified with the case study authors by rephrasing them. These ambiguities have been discovered during during different development phases: formalization, proof and validation using the provided scenarios. This experience has affirmed that the formal modeling of a system helps the software users detect error in early development phase that makes its correction cheaper.\n"," The main difficulty when modeling the speed control system is to determine the order in which elements should be introduced during the refinement especially that many elements are interdependent. Due to time constraints, we were unfortunately not able to explore the different decomposition plugins of Rodin that might produce smaller specification parts that would be easier to understand and maintain. We plan to explore some decomposition techniques as future work even if we really think that the Event-B method should include modularization clauses as native structuring mechanisms like those of the B method that permit to have a modular specification since the early development phases to make Event-B method more usable for the development of big and complex systems. Another point concerns the ProB plugin under Rodin that unfortunately does not permit to store an already played scenario, so we are obliged to manually replay each scenario; this is a very time-consuming for long traces.\n"," The work presented in this paper can also be extended by considering the remaining requirements that need more clarifications. Requirement SCS-21 for instance needs more information on how the system can deduce that deceleration of 3 m/s 2 is insufficient to prevent a collision without having any information about the acceleration of the preceding vehicle. Also, we think that more information should be provided on the internal variables like setV ehicleSpeed that represents the automatic acceleration of the system in order to able to build a more complete system. Finally through the different case studies proposed in the ABZ conference [8, 9] , we are now convinced of the need to improve the Event-B language to make it supports the real numbers as basic types. Its prover should be also extended to include more rules on arithmetic and set theories.\n","Score: 1.4952205283210058\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof Regional Trauma Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic Regional Trauma Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n","Body Text: The current global pandemic has impacted heavily on health systems, making unprecedented demands on resources, and forcing reconfiguration of services.\n"," Trauma and orthopaedic units have cancelled elective surgery, moved to virtual based clinics and have been forced to reconsider the provision of trauma. Our national elective orthopaedic centre has been re-designated as a trauma centre to allow tertiary centres re-direct triaged trauma. Many governments, as part of their COVID-19 management, have significantly restricted activity of the general population. We proposed that trauma patterns would change alongside these changes and maintaining existing standards of treatment would require dedicated planning and structures.\n"," Referrals over a six-week period (March 15 th -April 30 th ) were retrospectively reviewed.

Schools and cultural institutions were closed from March 12 th with non-essential businesses closing from March 24 th . A stay-at-home order was issued on March 27 th with brief exercise within two kilometres of the home allowed. This specific stay-athome order was sequentially extended through to May 5 th (10) . The country then J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f entered its re-opening phase with graduated reintroduction of non-essential activities over the course of the following six weeks (11) .\n"," As an example of reconfiguration undertaken, our national elective orthopaedic unit, based in the Dublin metropolitan area, was re-designated as a trauma unit on March 18th of 2020, with the suspension of all non-urgent elective surgery. The intended purpose was to divert pre-triaged low energy trauma in non COVID-19 patients away from tertiary centres within our metropolitan area. We undertook a review of the pattern of injuries referred to our reconfigured unit during this time. Trauma surgery commenced in our unit on March 18 th .\n"," Our unit acts as a national centre of excellence in adult and paediatric orthopaedic medicine, sports and exercise medicine and rehabilitation medicine, employing over 500 staff and incorporating an on-site radiology service. As a high-volume 159 bed unit, throughput averages 65 overnight cases and 100 day cases per week and more than 1500 primary and revision hip and knee arthroplasties per year. The hospital treats over 24,000 patients annually. Time from referral to surgery was recorded in days. Theatre activity data in the three trauma hospitals was collected for the corresponding time-period in 2019 and 2020 to allow for year on year comparison. χ 2 test was performed to analyse the data using Excel.\n"," There were 159 referrals for surgery from the three north of city hospitals for the time-period given. Females accounted for 55% (82/179) of cases. The mean age of patients was 55 (Range 17-92). The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1 (Range 0-8). The mean time to surgery from referral was 3 days (Range 0-17).\n"," F&A injuries were the most common (32%), followed by H&W (28%), UL (17%), H&F (16%) and K&T (7%). In comparison to the month of April in 2019, trauma theatre activity reduced by almost one half (45.3%), when remaining activity and transferred activity was considered, in the three referring hospitals (Table 1) .\n"," Injuries were sustained at home in 50% of cases. This varied significantly between pre (33%) and post (59%) 'lockdown'. Falls outside of the home happened in 45% of cases pre lockdown and in 36% of cases post lockdown ( Table 2) . Of the 159 referrals; in the pre-lockdown period there were 24 at home and 31 outside home;\n"," during the post-lockdown phase there were 66 at home and 38 outside of home, see post-operatively.\n"," The landscape of orthopaedic practice has changed for the foreseeable future.\n"," Urgent elective cases and trauma will be prioritised while the pandemic continues.\n"," Current restrictions in activity have impacted on the volume of trauma occurring and the type of injuries sustained (12) . Data from our region shows a significant reduction in operative trauma presenting to acute hospitals for this period when compared to 2019. Simple falls at home are the most common mechanism. The data depicts a shift from the pre 'lockdown' period when simple falls outside the home were more common. Compliance with activity restrictions have reduced sporting and workrelated injuries while increasing home improvement and personal exercise injuries, reflected by an increase in medium energy injuries around the home. Pilon type ankle fractures made up 10% of the foot and ankle cases with tri-malleolar fractures making up a further 28%. While our trauma model, in combination with reduced volumes, has allowed trauma to be treated along existing guidelines the expectation is that volumes will increase as work, leisure, and travel activity increases (13) . The ability of trauma systems to cope with those increasing volumes under new working environments presents a challenge unique to these times. Safety of theatre staff, theatre turnover times and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f post-operative care capacity are among the aspects that will alter day to day practice (14) . Fracture management needs to be reconsidered in line with the new BOAST guidelines. COVID positive patients have a significant 30-day peri-operative mortality suggesting that only essential surgeries be undertaken in this group(15).\n"," Knowledge also continues to evolve around associated longer term comorbidities in the form of a post COVID-19 syndrome. The musculoskeletal system, as in most viral illnesses, is affected by COVID-19 with a percentage of patient's experience symptoms in the form of myalgias, arthalgias and fatigue. The mechanisms by which the disease produces these symptoms is unknown and an open mind must be given to the possibility of a post COVID-19 syndrome which includes pathology in the musculoskeletal system (16) . Finding a balance in providing an appropriate level of care at a reasonable level of risk to those involved is hugely challenging and consensus statements and algorithms will aid in the optimisation of care (17) .\n"," In the COVID negative cohort, fractures that have a viable delayed treatment, e.g.\n"," later corrective osteotomy in extra-articular distal radius fractures (18) , may need to be de-prioritised to maintain adequate service provision. While making a balanced decision to delay treatment may be required in certain cases, another aspect to consider is the delayed presentation of trauma due to anxieties around attending hospital during a pandemic (19, 20) . The discrepancies in our data between 2019 and 2020 are thought to be based on lower trauma volumes but may be at least partially accounted for by 'hidden trauma'. This phenomenon may place unforeseen demands on reconstructive services at a later date. It is important to acknowledge that the situation will likely remain dynamic through to 2021 and a degree of flexibility in management of trauma systems will be required.\n"," Reduction in elective theatre access will create opportunities for units to re-orient rotas directing specific trauma to the care of more freely available specialists. Our centralised unit created dedicated foot and ankle, hand and wrist, upper limb, hip, and knee lists aimed at ensuring injuries were treated by relevant specialists more frequently compared to pre-COVID-19. This highlights that while significant challenges lie ahead, the current environment will also present opportunities for improvement. We believe that we have created an important blueprint for the reallocation of elective orthopaedic resources for trauma in a crisis environment. We are undoubtedly in a better position to deal with any short-term fluctuations in trauma service demands created by the current pandemic. While we will endeavour to reintroduce elective surgery as expeditiously as possible to our centre to the benefit of thousands of patients awaiting orthopaedic procedures, we will continue to provide an overflow trauma service. Incorporating provisions for a second wave and the continued availability of trauma theatre into the medium term is a key consideration given the short-term unpredictability of the healthcare environment.\n"," Longer term, appropriate foresight around innovations in service provision that are required now can also be used to improve trauma and orthopaedics for the long term.\n"," Trauma and orthopaedic service provision is changing in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with population lockdowns, trauma volumes have dropped and trends in mechanisms have changed. Likewise, volumes and trends will shift once more as countries 're-open' (21) . Jurisdictions must consider how to provide an ( \n","Score: 1.489391963992333\n","\n","Title: Caregiving for Interstage Infants: A Continuous Process of Compromise During the Pandemic\n","Body Text: Single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) refers to a group of congenital heart defects in which the heart functionally has only one ventricular chamber. SVHD has an incidence of 0.8 cases per 1000 live births. 1 The majority of SVHD requires 3 or more staged palliative surgical procedures before 4 years of age. The time between the first and second stage surgery, known as the interstage period, has the highest associated mortality. 1 The development and implementation of home monitoring programs have improved survival up to 80% to 90% during the interstage period. [1] [2] [3] Home monitoring includes interdisciplinary care coordination and educating parents as home caregivers. Caregivers are trained to use a pulse oximeter and weight scale and are asked to record respective parameters along with feeding volumes each day, target parameters, and \"red flags\" that reflect a change in the infant's clinical condition that should prompt caregivers to seek immediate medical attention. 2, 3 Consequently, interstage monitoring has shifted the burden of care to the home, adding stress to everyday life with potential clinical implications. Infants with SVHD are at higher risk for hospital readmission due to contracting a cold or the flu. Hence, many caregivers take extra precautions to keep their infants healthy and avoid potential exposure to illness. This often results in being confined at home and avoiding social gatherings, affecting the caregivers' psychological and social well-being. 4 Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, parental stress and adjustment to caring for a medically complex infant may be heightened. Caregivers often rely on extended family, friends, and hired caretakers to provide relief or respite time. However, the pandemic removed these options due to stay-at-home and social distancing orders across the country. Although the protective measures for a viral illness and COVID-19 are the same, the novelty and aggressive replication of the latter could be associated with additional stress and uncertainty to caregivers during the interstage period.\n"," During the interstage period, the well-being of caregivers and families may be at risk for adverse consequences, including financial hardship, social isolation, disruption of family support, and threats to livelihood. However, little is known about the impact of interstage home monitoring on caregivers and their families, and even less is known about managing this during a global pandemic. Thus, we explored caregivers' experiences during the interstage period, including impacts on their lifestyle, as they managed their infants' critical needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n"," Two Institutional Review Boards approved this study (hospital study site and the academic affiliation). Primary caregivers over the age of 18 years whose infants underwent first-stage palliation surgery for SVHD were recruited 2 to 4 months after discharge from a large children's hospital in Southern California between November 2019 and July 2020. After obtaining written informed consent, caregivers completed the sociodemographic form, 5 the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) 6 and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) 7 questionnaires to gain insight into the levels of stress and anxiety of caregivers at the time of the interviews. Participants were interviewed at a time and place of their choosing by the principal investigator (PI). All interviews were audio-recorded; approximately half were done in-person and, due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions put into place 4 months after data collection began, the other half were conducted telephonically. A certified hospital interpreter participated in interviews with 3 Spanish-speaking participants. Each participant received a $30 gift card after completing the questionnaires and interview.\n"," Parenting Stress Index-Short Form. The PSI-SF is a 36-item inventory tool that measured the stress level experienced by caregivers at the time of the interviews. The tool has 4 domains or subscales: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, difficult child, and total stress. A score at or above the 85th percentile is considered high, and scores at or above the 90th percentile indicate clinically significant stress that may warrant professional consultation. 6 General Anxiety Disorder-7. The GAD-7 is a validated 7-item questionnaire that measures the severity of symptoms related to generalized anxiety disorder. The score ranges from 0 to 21 (cut-points: 5 = mild, >10 = moderate, >15 = severe). 7\n"," Constructivist Grounded Theory methodology informed by Symbolic Interactionism 8, 9 guided data collection and analysis. Inductive and abductive approaches were used to generate a theory grounded in data gathered through participant interviews 8 (Figure 1 ). The PI developed an intensive interview guide with open-ended questions 8 that was informed by the literature plus clinical and methodological experts.\n"," Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim by a professional transcriptionist, de-identified, checked for accuracy, and coded line-by-line. 8 Guided by the Grounded Theory methodology, we sampled for meaning and lived experiences rather than to fulfill a particular number of participant interviews. Simultaneous to data collection, we conducted initial and focused coding and incident-by-incident coding. We continuously engaged in constant comparison of data with data and codes with codes. We used various analytic techniques to scrutinize the data to gain an in-depth understanding of meaning to develop concepts and their properties.\n"," Moving from the concrete (transcribed interviews) to the abstract (concepts with properties) shown in Figure 1 , we identified the most significant and frequently developed codes within the first 7 interviews, which formed 23 focused codes. 8 We used Excel spreadsheets to systematically list and compare data grouped by each focused code. From this, we narrowed the list of 23 to 12 focused codes. We systematically examined nuances and similarities using a constant comparison of data within each of the 12 focused-code groups. 9 This led to the development of 2 salient concepts that were in dynamic relation to each other. Using abduction, 8 we repetitively compared our emerging interpretations with actual quotations to refine articulation of the concepts and their properties, using data from all participants (P). 9 Then, we recognized the need for more data to clarify specific aspects of some properties. Hence, we used theoretical sampling 8 and conducted 4 additional interviews (P1, P2, P5, P10), gaining more understanding of specific properties through deeper analysis. We reached full articulation or saturation of the concepts and properties after the 18th interview leading to a situation-specific theory. 8, 9 To enhance methodological rigor, each research team member collaborated in each stage of coding and analysis and reflexive memos were written to reduce assumptions that might have affected the coding process. 8 Atlas. ti software 10 was used to organize all data and codes. Descriptive statistics presented the participants' demographic characteristics, PSI-SF, and GAD-7 scores.\n"," Of the 14 caregivers in our sample (10 mothers and 4 fathers), 4 were interviewed twice for a total of 18 interviews (mean length of interview = 64 min [range 45-95]). Most caregivers were between ages 19 and 44 (mean 28 ± 7.8), unmarried (78%), Latinx/Hispanic (64.3%), and spoke English (71.4%). Most had public insurance (64.3%) and earned under $30 000 per year (42.8%). The mean PSI-SF total score was 70.6 (± 16.5; 35-50th percentile), and subscales Parental Distress 26.7 (±8.9), Parent-Child Dysfunction Interaction 18.7 (± 5.9), and Difficult Child 25.2 (± 6.7), indicating caregivers experienced \"typical\" levels of stress. The PSI-SF also showed a sample mean for the Defensive Responding subscale score of >10, indicating an unbiased response to the questionnaire. 6 The GAD-7 showed 50% reported mild anxiety (Table 1) .\n"," Our sample of caregivers described various ways they promoted their infants' health and safety during the interstage period. Based on participants' experiences, we developed a grounded theory titled, Caregiving for Infants with SVHD in the Interstage Period during COVID-19: A Continuous Process of Compromise ( Figure 2 ). It consists of 2 concepts: Accepting and adapting to a restrictive home environment and Reconciling what is and what is yet to come. See Table 2 . All participants' names were replaced with a numeric code (P1, P2, etc).\n"," Accepting and adapting to a restrictive home environment Properties. \"It's just normal\": Being vigilant became normalized due to COVID-19. The caregivers in our sample had the goal of protecting their infants from getting sick. Many participants believed that the only way to keep a safe space between their infant and other threats was continued vigilance to avoid physical contact with others, even friends and family members. Overall, the caregivers learned that their infants' vulnerabilities meant restricting their activities outside and inside the home. One caregiver (P7) said, \"I just want to do it myself, and I did not want them to visit my home because I don't want my baby to get sick from them.\"\n"," Participants reported they worked hard to adapt to the restrictions. Eventually, being vigilant became part of their everyday life. However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought a meaningful change because their private experiences with vigilance became a public necessity for the entire nation. For one mother (P14), comparing her experience before and after the pandemic was pivotal in her self-understanding. She and her husband had put much effort into fostering a home life within the parameters given to them at the hospital. They hoped it would start to feel \"normal\" at some point despite the ongoing difficulties. However, when the COVID-19 restrictions were put into place everywhere, she found it added value to her efforts and gave them an advantage that the rest of the country did not have. She said, \"It feels like we practiced for the whole quarantine situation going on now!\" Similarly, one father (P11) in our sample described his experience and expressed gratitude that all their vigilant efforts served as training for the pandemic restrictions. He said, \"we're, like, in training for this. So, for us, it's a walk in the park!\" Thus, the caregivers found that their heightened vigilance to protect their vulnerable infant became normalized due to similar restrictions imposed on society due to COVID-19, bringing a form of acceptance they had not expected.\n"," Confining self to home as the right way to protect. When discussing the strategy of confining themselves to home, many participants talked about right and wrong actions. One parent (P16) said staying home was the \"right thing to do\" to keep their infant healthy in anticipation of the second-stage surgery. Caregivers had strong feelings about protecting their infants from returning to the hospital due to complications or infections. One mother (P9) admitted she struggled with the boundaries of \"bad\" versus good or right. In the end, she noted that her feelings helped determine how to compromise and decide what to do. I know it's not bad to take her out, but I feel better keeping her home. We don't take her out just because there's always a big crowd. We don't go anywhere unless we really have to, like buying certain things for the kids or groceries or a doctor's appointment.\n"," Staying home was not easy, but caregivers found ways to make it work. For example, some parents gave up their preference for attending religious services together as a family and found a compromise. One parent (P5) explained, \"We like going to church together as a family, and we haven't, 'cause we don't wanna take him to church, so he's [husband] going one day, and I go the next.\" However, unlike the rest in our sample, 2 caregivers described themselves as \"homebody.\" Staying home was already comfortable for them. As one of the caregivers (P13) said, \"I was always just a home person, so it's not really a problem for me.\" Other participants found staying home less desirable, but it was a sacrifice or compromise they felt compelled to make. As one caregiver (P2) commented, \"I don't hang out anymore. I don't do a lot of stuff that I used to.\"\n"," Reckoning with the awkwardness of the social distance process. Fear was a primary motivation for caregivers. They took measures via social distancing to avoid contact with others who could make them or their infant sick. One father (P4) described how careful he was to avoid any possible contact with someone who might be sick. He asked visitors specific questions, which he described as follows: \"Before you touch him, did you wash your hands? Have you been sick in the past couple of days?\" Many participants became even more vigilant when the COVID-19 pandemic started. As one caregiver (P14) explained, Many caregivers avoided joining social gatherings because \"vetting\" attendees led to an uncomfortable situation. As one caregiver (P8) explained, \"Having an interstage baby and having a hypoplastic baby is all-encompassing; it's all you ever really talk about.\" She explained that this was foremost in her mind whenever she talked to her friends as she tried to determine who was safe to be around her child. One caregiver (P16) said the work of determining who could or could not come into her home also had financial repercussions. She and her husband both worked from home, styling and cutting hair. However, due to their infant's condition, she had to decide whom she would or would not allow into her house, which was very stressful and difficult. Many caregivers in the study chose to stay socially connected with family and friends who do not live in their homes by calling, using video chat, or staying connected through social media. As one mother (P13) said, \"Since the stay-at-home order, we Facetime and text. We don't go to their house, and they don't come to our house.\"\n"," Properties. Living in a Suspended State. Participants felt uncertain and worried about their infants' future and possible surgical outcomes. One caregiver (P5) felt that \"life is kind of paused, not sure how it will go.\" Many put family plans on hold because they had to stay home until the infant was ready for the second surgery. Caregivers felt uncertain about their infant's surgical outcomes and imagined the worst-case scenario. One father (P4) stated, He's relying on a man-made shunt that could give out. We're not actually guaranteed the next day with him. We've heard many stories where babies post-Norwood go through cardiac arrest, and they don't make it to the second surgery.\n"," Participants explained that each day brought challenging experiences, but they learned they could only deal with what was before them. As one mother (P8) remarked, Everything about my life has been put on hold essentially to take care of my son. Your time is compromised because you're taking care of a new life, and everything just doesn't matter at that point.\n"," This mother's view shows how caregivers coped with the current reality of life by prioritizing their infant while simultaneously putting off their own needs. This suspended them in time as they faced 1 day at a time during the interstage period.\n"," Struggling with conflicting feelings. Participants reported that they experienced constant worrying about their infants when taking care of them, including worries about the crucial need to gain weight. Under typical circumstances, they would have turned to friends or family for emotional and social support, but because they feared sick contacts, many caregivers in our sample avoided getting together with others even though this meant they gave up intimate discussions they otherwise would have had. They saw the trade-off and had to weigh the pros and cons. This contributed to an emotional aloneness. Additionally, some caregivers felt alienated from confidantes. For example, a first-time mother (P5) struggled with feeling misunderstood. Her own sister expressed astonishment about the difficulties of caring for her infant as if it was impossible to comprehend. I feel like when she [sister] said, 'I would never be able to do it. How do you do it?' And it feels like people look at you as the special people who can handle that kind of thing when really if it happened to you, you'd do it. I think mostly, it's sort of isolating, where you feel like no one quite gets it.\n"," She did not want to be considered \"special,\" as if she was abnormally able to handle difficult things in life. Rather, she wanted to be understood by her sister as a person facing a life challenge just as anyone else would. The ensuing feeling of isolation from an otherwise trusted person brought difficult feelings of inner conflict.\n"," In our sample, a working mom (P7) spoke about how she wanted some freedom in her regimented life, only to have the feeling evaporate as soon as it arose when she became grounded in her connection to her infant. She explained, \"… but there's times where I wish I could just be free again and just be able to get up and go and not have to worry.\" One father (P15), who lived with his mother, found himself reconciling his feelings about his life before and after becoming a parent. He explained, \"I was used to not having to deal with anything at homejust being able to do anything I wanted, whenever I wanted.\" The process of straddling conflicting feelings was a daily lived experience that called for emotional and social compromise for this father, as it was for the many in our sample.\n"," Looking beyond the \"Interstage Period\" with hope and trepidation. While participants anticipated their infants' subsequent surgeries, foremost in their thoughts were keeping their infants healthy and maintaining their weight gain to be clinically ready for the second stage surgery. One father (P1) said, \"Basically, I don't focus so much on the future, but take it one day at a time.\" He focused on the future hoping that they would be able to \"breathe a little bit after the next surgery.\" Many participants projected hope that their infant would be a \"normal child after the second surgery.\" This might have been due to an optimistic coping style or misinterpretation or difficulty processing complex medical information. One mother (P7) shared her reasons for believing the future would be better for her and her infant, saying, \"She'll be bigger, and she will be eating well. So, we won't get so tied down at home.\" Others anticipated a life free from worries about their child's struggles with maintaining good oxygenation and thoughts of dying due to shunt failure.\n"," Some participants talked about their eagerness for their infant to go through the second surgery but at the same time reported that it was a source of anxiety. One caregiver (P17) summed up the trepidation that many caregivers felt by saying, I'd like for him to have his second surgery soon, but I'm worried that he's going to go through the same thing again, just like the first surgery. And it's very complicated. It worries me that he may not make it.\n"," The very act of desiring the subsequent surgery to be done as soon as possible was accompanied by a fear of the worst possible outcome. Caregivers did not know what was in store, and they were aware that their infant could die during, or as a result of, the next surgery. Regardless of this trepidation, caregivers leaned into an image of a desirable future and hope, saying, \"I think it will get easier after the fact.\" (P7)\n"," Our findings describe caregivers' experiences during the interstage period of their infants with SVHD amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The diversity of our sample (Black, White, Latina mothers of diverse ages, and health insurance) brings insight that expands the literature. Caring for an infant is stressful under normal circumstances which can be intensified if the infant has complex medical needs. 4, 11 This stress was, in some ways, further heightened during the pandemic, leading caregivers in our sample to adopt hypervigilant practices to protect their infants. 12 Thus, our participants entered what we termed, A Continuous Process of Compromise related to social and family restrictions as they tended to their infants' health and safety. Learning to accept and adapt to a restrictive home environment was ongoing as they reconciled their current reality with what was yet to come with the second surgery. Figure 2 depicts our theory, including 2 simultaneous experiences featured as concepts (shown by the overlapping circles) that fed into and fueled each other in a continuous cycle (shown by the arrows).\n"," To avoid hospital admissions, the caregivers in our sample identified the need to restrict their home environment to keep their infants safe and healthy during the interstage period. They achieved this goal by being vigilant in maintaining a safe space between their infants and others. It was a difficult process and led to awkward interactions while they vetted who could be around their infants among their family and friends. While not unique to caregivers of infants or children with congenital heart disease, 13 the vigilance of our participants turned into hypervigilance in the face of a nationwide pandemic with potentially fatal consequences. Vetting family and friends became a time-consuming part of each caregiver's everyday experience.\n"," The process of social distancing made caregivers vulnerable to isolation. A similar finding was found in a study that identified \"isolation\" as a theme in online discussions with parents of children with congenital heart disease after surgery. 14 The emotional burden of feeling \"alone\" while caring for a medically fragile infant was also found in other studies with caregivers in the initial period after their infants' hospital discharge. 15, 16 Our study highlights how caregivers gradually developed adaptive skills for caring for their high-risk infants after severe social and family lifestyle disruption.\n"," For our participants, the process of acceptance and adaptation to a restrictive home environment was the experiential beginning of a continuous process of compromise. As participants navigated the restrictive home environment, they found themselves caught between desiring to socially distance and longing to be with their family and friends. Thus, they lost valuable support systems (family, friends, faith-based gatherings) that would have ordinarily been available to them. To manage the day-to-day challenges, caregivers were forced to make compromises such as leaving their job, reducing work hours, changing their living arrangements, altering daily schedules, and choosing between their own health needs and those of their infant. These compromises are not necessarily unusual for firsttime parents as they navigate parenthood; when they bring the infant home, parents realize the sacrifices and selflessness needed to raise a child. But they were pronounced for our participants.\n"," Many families faced similar compromises during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as working from home, assisting children in remote education, and getting by despite reduced daily resources, plus being unable to enjoy family outings or vacations. 17, 18 However, compromises were compounded by fears of sudden death during the interstage period plus the possibility of contracting COVID-19.\n"," Our participants had to reconcile the reality of their infants' status in the present with their looming fears of what was yet to come. They were forced to confront the reality of caring for their medically complex infant, knowing any red flag could pop up at any moment and lead to unexpected hospital readmission or a sudden emergency requiring an immediate response while awaiting a pending operation with an uncertain outcome. The work to reconcile these realities of what is and what is yet to come, involved accepting both as part of the process.\n"," Despite limited financial resources and pandemic stressors, our participants reported stress levels on the PSI-SF considered typical 6 and about half reported mild anxiety (based on GAD-7 7 ). This is remarkable in the context of the heavy load on their shoulders in the interstage period. In contrast, 33% of mothers and 16% of fathers caring for their infants at home 1 month after cardiac surgery who participated in a different study reported trauma symptoms associated with acute stress disorders. 19 Indeed, the care demands of the infants were high for our sample, but they may have experienced an adjustment period to home life when we interviewed them 2 to 4 months after hospital discharge. The lower levels of reported stress could have been related to individual resources and inherent resilience. 20, 21 Our theory, A Continuous Process of Compromise, is grounded in the words and experiences of participants but may apply to other groups of high-risk infants and children for whom morbidity and mortality are real threats. For example, other studies with caregivers of premature infants 22 and pediatric cancer patients 23 also demonstrated parental feelings of isolation related to protecting their infants from exposure to illness from people outside their homes. However, the theory that resulted from our analysis emphasizes how caregivers perceived uncertainty, change, and crisis as normal, rather than exceptional.\n"," The process of compromise was experienced as dynamic; caregivers were continuously responding to ongoing threats in their everyday life with their infants. They learned to adapt to the restrictions brought upon them by home confinement and in the process, developed ways to get through this difficult time. Simultaneously, participants grappled with accepting their current situation while also thinking about the second staged surgery yet to come. Throughout, sacrifices made by caregivers were endured for the sake of their infant's healthcare needs and eventually were accepted as part of the process. Despite the limited social support available due to the pandemic, the caregivers continued to demonstrate optimism for the outcome of their infant's second surgery. 21 While we did not collect data on the timing of infants' cardiac diagnoses, future research could explore possible differences in caregiver experiences when made pre versus postnatally.\n"," Our study has some notable strengths, including the ethnically diverse caregiver participants, fathers as primary caregivers. Furthermore, we used induction and abduction to generate a theory through the rigorous grounded theory approach. However, the PI had indirect clinical encounters with caregivers while hospitalized, which may have impacted how participants were viewed and created additional bias. Our investigative team remained attentive to this insider status during data analyses. Furthermore, in light of the pandemic, participants may have followed a higher level of restrictions than they would have if they were experiencing the interstage period at a time before the pandemic. However, the participants were able to differentiate changes in their lives before and after the pandemic restrictions were enforced. Our study responded to the American Heart Association Interstage Home Monitoring Scientific Statement 24 for needed research that addressed the caregiver experience to identify ways to improve home monitoring programs for infants with SVHD.\n"," Caregivers of infants with SVHD during the interstage period faced challenges related to social and family relationships resulting in a process of continuous compromise to maintain their infant's health during the pandemic.

2019-nCoV spread and their disinfection with biocidal agents\n","Body Text: Earliest case of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV detected on 17 November 2019 from Wuhan China, has killed over 25,000 people and infected more than 500,000 globally as of March 28, 2020 (WHO, 2020). It has been spread to at least 202 countries and territories [1] . United States is now on the top with 107,463 confirmed cases followed by Italy and Spain as of March 28, 2020 (www.covidvisualizer.com). Research has explained person to person transmission both in hospital and family settings [2] . Some reports have described by local news channels and WHO. In Italy, at least 2,629 health workers have been infected by coronavirus since the onset of the outbreak in February 2020, representing 8.3 percent of total cases. In Pakistan, earliest case was reported in a group of people who travelled to Iran for visit purposes. Soon after this, virus transmitted to other people and healthcare professionals with great speed. In Thailand, a taxi driver was detected positive with COVID 19 who had no travel history to china [2] . Common signs and symptoms of infection include fever, coughing and labored breathing. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death [3] . The incubation period of COVID-19 is thought to be between 1 and 14 days [4] . It is contagious before symptoms appear, which is why so many people get infected. Infected patients can be also asymptomatic, meaning they do not display any symptoms despite having the virus in their systems. It is therefore, dire need of time to prevent or slow down the spread of this virus among public and healthcare settings.\n"," Contamination of dry surfaces could be serve as transmission route of coronaviruses. Moreover, it is proposed that viruses can be transmitted through self-inoculation of mucous membranes of nose, eyes and mouth [5, 6] . Not many scientific studies have conducted to examine the survivability of 2019-nCoV on various surfaces and seasons, because it was discovered so recently. Most data will be taken from endemic human corona virus strain (HCoV-229E). Some studies reported that it can survive on metals, glass, plastic and fibers for as long as 9 days. Some veterinary coronaviruses can even hang around for up to 28 days in low temperatures. 2019-nCoV causes COVID-19 can live in the air and on surfaces between several hours and several days. 2019-nCoV is viable for up to 72 h on plastics, 48 h on stainless steel and 24 h on cardboard. Copper surfaces tend to kill the virus in about 4 h. Research further revealed that the virus could survive in droplets for up to 3 h after being coughed out into the air [7] . Furthermore, governments worldwide are quarantining bank notes, as the coronavirus pandemic puts the spotlight on the germ-spreading properties of 'real' money. The US, South Korea and China have all been taking action amid concerns that the disease could be spread by paper money and coins. In addition, HCoV-229E strain persists better at 50% relative humidity at room temperature [8] ( Table 1 ).\n"," Use of 78-95% Ethanol, 70-100% iso-propanol, 0.5-2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.7-1.0% formaldehyde, and 0.23-7.5% povidone iodine either individually or simultaneously inactivates coronaviruses infectivity in suspension tests. Other disinfectants such as 0.21% Sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% Hydrogen peroxide, and 0.05% Benzalkonium could also kill coronaviruses effectively on recommended concentrations illustrated in Table 2 [9] .\n"," In carrier tests, ethanol (62-71%), Sodium hypochlorite (0.1-0.5%), Glutardialdehyde (2.0%), Glutardialdehyde (0.04%) and Sodium hypochlorite (0.06%) proved effective against coronaviruses presented in Table 3 [9] .\n"," Human coronaviruses remain infectious on dry surfaces for 2-9 days at room temperature. Duration can be shorter at a temperature of 30°C or more. Unlike of human, veterinary coronaviruses persists even longer for 28 days. Contamination of frequent use surfaces in healthcare and home settings are potential source of viral transmission. Transmission of coronaviruses from contaminated surfaces was not supported with research but it could be observed in case of Influenza A and Parainfluenza virus 3 cases, as 31.6% and 1.5% viral load can transfer to hands in 5 and 3 s respectively [10, 11] . During outbreak situations, viral load of SARC COV-2 is not known on frequent touch surfaces, it seems plausible to disinfect them to reduce the chances of disease incidence. The WHO recommends thoroughly cleaning of surfaces with water, detergent and commonly used disinfectants are effective to clean the environment [12] . The dilution of 1:100 of 5% bleach (sodium hypochlorite) seems appropriate to recommend in the coronavirus setting. 70% concertation of ethanol could be effective for the disinfestation of small surfaces for coronavirus [13] . The WHO recommends alcohol-based hand rubs for the decontamination of hands, e.g. after removing gloves. Formulations based on 80% ethanol or 75% 2-propanol proved very effective against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and recommended by WHO [14] . No study has reported in-vitro efficacy of hand washing against coronavirus contaminations on hands. However, in Taiwan, installation of hand wash stations in the healthcare settings protected the healthcare professionals from acquiring the SARS-COV infection, indicating that hand hygiene can have protective effects [15] . Furthermore, virus is highly sensitive to high temperature and it is hypnotized that it could significantly change COVID-19 transmission. 2019-nCoV can survive in air for 3 h and on inanimate objects for more than 72 h. Disinfection of frequent touch surfaces with 62-71% ethanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide can be considered effective against 2019-nCoV as other coronaviruses become ineffective with 1 min exposure time.\n","Score: 15.527888766551804\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof Exhaled gas decontamination by connecting a ventilator exhaust port with an underwater seal system to prevent COVID-19 spread Title\n","Body Text: Airborne infection isolation rooms with negative pressure are not universally available, especially in resource-limited settings like outbreak of corona virus infectious disease-19 .Intensive care unit preparedness in the setting of COVID-19 pandemics have been focused on broad concepts of infection control, increasing staffing capacity, and community engagement. [1] Aerosol-generating procedures should be performed on ICU patients with COVID-19 in a negative pressure room to avoid cross-contamination during the SARS epidemic. [2] Other infection precautions for mechanically ventilated patient include the use of closed systems and dual limb circuitry with a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter attached to the exhalation limb to minimize environmental contamination and to minimize the risk of malfunction of expiratory flow sensors due to contamination with aerosol. [3] It is important that expiratory filters are changed after each nebulizer treatment, or every two to four hours when continuous aerosols are administered. The coronavirus species, ranges in size from 0.06 to 0.2 μm. It is widely believed that HEPA filters are only capable of capturing particles sized 0.3 μm or larger. HEPA filters have been demonstrated to reduce virus transmission in simulated settings. [3] However the tiny mass of particles less than 0.3 μm not able to fly straight stuck into the HEPA filter due to Brownian movement. US government standards require a filter to remove 99.97% of particles sized 0.3 μm in order to qualify as HEPA. [4] In order to provide complete filtration and decontamination of exhaled air, we made an assembly by connecting a ventilator exhalation port (Hamilton C3, SN 2138, Switzerland) with an underwater seal system containing 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, Figure 1 . This assembly allows the passage of exhaled air through 1% sodium hypochlorite solution to make them decontaminated. An earlier study by Kampf G et al [5] concluded that COVID-19, including SARS coronavirus, Middle East J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV), can persist on inanimate surfaces, such as metal, glass, or plastic, for up to 9 days, but are efficiently inactivated by 62% to 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. This assembly may provide an extra protection from COVID-19 cross infection, especially when negative pressure space is not available. In our ICU setup we didn't measure the environmental Covid 19 virus particles level before and after the use of sodium hypochlorite underwater seal system, and thus further research and testing are necessary to validate this hypothesis.\n","Score: 12.998361286505663\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof Time course and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resurgence due to cold-chain food or packaging contamination Time course and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resurgence due to cold-chain food or packaging contamination\n","Body Text: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a global pandemic since early 2020 [1] . With strict nonpharmaceutical public health interventions, the local transmission of COVID-19 was contained in China; however, there have been small-scale outbreaks, especially in port cities, which was believed to be related to contaminated cold-chain food or materials, causing great concern in global. The report from WHO also mentioned the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through frozen products [2] . The persistence, stability and infectivity of contaminated inanimate surfaces argued [3] , to explore the indirect transmission routes of infection by fomite which was ignored.\n"," COVID-19, is a respiratory infection, and the accepted route of transmission is respiratory droplets dispersed by coughing, sneezing, talking and singing or by the spread of aerosols. There is no evidence supporting that SARS-CoV-2 can follow the fecal-oral route, and the chance of foodborne transmission is extremely low [4] . However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 particles from infected personnel to food packaging or to food surfaces is possible. While viruses are not able to propagate on the materials, these materials may work as a potential carrier for their spread. Transmission may occur indirectly through touching contaminated surfaces, followed by touching the mucosal membranes of mouth, nose, or eyes, and fomite transmission is possible [5] . We review the serial events in China after the main outbreak in Wuhan that related to contaminated frozen products and analyze relevant laboratory evidence support this hypothesis, hope to provide a few tips to strengthen the weak links of epidemic prevention and control.\n"," To clarify the possibility of cold-chain food or packaging contamination as a route of COVID-19 transmission, we performed a search on the official website of the Centers for Disease Control of China and local authorities (http://www.chinacdc.cn/en/) for resurgence events that related to cold-chain food or packaging contamination, and official reports or literature about traceability investigation.\n"," We also conducted a literature and report search to assess the relevant epidemiological events and laboratory basis of this transmission route, to support the existence of such mode of transmission.\n"," Since July 2020, a series of incidents of imported frozen food as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in China, and most of the incidents were traced to frozen shrimp imported from Ecuador, where novel coronavirus was found not only on the outer packaging [6] , but also on the inner packaging of frozen Pomfret from Ecuador [7].\n"," On August 12, 2020, authorities in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province found SARS-CoV-without any contact history; later in the outbreak investigation, live virus was isolated from the outer packaging of imported frozen cold cod that was carried by the two stevedores [9]. This event became the first known case where the live SARS-CoV-2 was detected on coldchain food in the world, confirming that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on the outer packaging for a long time under the condition of cold-chain transportation. This finding strongly supports the possibility of cold-chain foods as a vehicle of SARS-CoV-2 spread through cross-border transportation [10].\n"," In fact, as early as 1975, researchers have already found that viruses can survive long-term on common surfaces found in environments, and may play a role in virus transmission [11] .\n"," The recent studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 was detected from inanimate surface in the patient surroundings [12], another study shows unabsorbent materials like plastic are more dangerous than absorbent materials like cotton, because contaminated droplets are difficult to absorb [13] . Besides the effect of different types of materials, humidity and low temperature are more conducive to the survival of virus. SARS-CoV-2 was reported as being viable in aerosols for up to 3 hours and on the surface of stainless steel and plastic for up to 2 and 3 days, respectively, at 21-23℃ and a relative humidity of 40% [14] .\n"," Another study showed that SARS-CoV-2 was stable on swine skin for at least 14 days at 4℃ [15] . Whether at 4℃ or -30℃, refrigerated human milk did not significantly affect the SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral load over 48h period [16] . The lifespan of SARS-CoV-2 at 50% humidity was longer than at 30% humidity [17] . To ensure the quality of cold-chain food, when stored, transported, or sold, low temperature must be maintained all the time, usually at or below -18℃. Plastic is the most common material for outer packaging. The The cold-chain food and their packing could be contaminated at any step of production and transportation, through droplets expelled from infected workers who do not have appropriate personal protection equipment, by coughing, sneezing, talking or even breathing.\n"," On June 11, 2020, after 56 consecutive days of no local transmission events in Beijing, a 52-year-old man was diagnosed with COVID-19, without any contact or travel history. Majority of the outbreaks in China could always be traced to the transmission chain originating from imported food products or mails to workers at market sites, seafood processing facilities, port cold storage, and postal mailing service [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Source of these infections was believed to be contaminated cold-chain food or materials, and it seems more dangerous because infectious SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to survive on the surface of cold-chain food packages for at least 60 days [28] , and even longer at colder temperature and on extreme relative humidity (U-shaped dependence) [29] . With the occurrence of these outbreaks, we realized the existence of such a potential transmission route, and the corresponding prevention and control measures were come up with, and the scale of dissemination was gradually reduced.\n"," On August 11, 2020, New Zealand announced four confirmed cases in one Auckland household after 102 consecutive days of no local transmission events. These cases had no overseas travel history, but one of them was the employee of a cold-chain company [30] .\n"," On August 13, another 13 newly confirmed cases were reported; 3 were employees at the same cold-chain company, and another 7 were family members of these employees. As of October 20, 2020, a total of 179 origin-unknown cases with a C.12 lineage of virus sequence have been reported, and designated as the outbreak of Auckland August Cluster [31] .\n"," Similar outbreaks occurred among workers at processing facilities for meat, poultry, seafood, fruit and vegetable were also observed in other countries, including Japan, Australia, Germany, England and Wales, and the United States [32] .\n"," In addition to SARS-COV-2, norovirus have similar transmission. From July to October, 2019, there have been multiple cruise ship outbreaks of norovirus in the United States, after the review of food provisioning implicated the raspberries as the infection cause. Subsequently, frozen raspberries that can be traced back to China was recalled [33].\n"," We have also noticed that food production workers might be at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection because of their work [34] . Distinctive factors contributed to workplace transmission, including prolonged close contact with coworkers, shared work space, shared transportation and congregate housing [35] . The high-risk workplaces were meat and poultry processing facilities, which had the closest connection with cold-chain food [35, 36] . According to the data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, during March 1 -May 31, 2020, there were 28,364 reported cases and 132 (0.5%) deaths among workers in 382 meat and poultry processing facilities in 31 states\n"," [37]. These workplaces were often crowded, and always with high humidity, which is an ideal environment for SARS-CoV-2 to linger and spread. In the process of production and packaging, the virus might attach to the inner and outer packaging, even to food, and persist for a long time under the conditions of cold chain transportation. Under such circumstances, human-to-human, human-to-material, and material-to-human transmissions were all possible.\n"," J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19 is a respiratory infection, virus could replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and shed high RNA copies to environment, especially in the first week of symptom onset [38, 39] . SARS-CoV-2 is also considered to be more stable and persistent than other human coronaviruses in the environment [40] . The following conditions are required for contaminated cold-chain food or packaging to cause human infection. First, COVID-19 carrier could shed virus to surface; second, the virus is still alive after long distances transported, and can remain highly stable on material surfaces, such as card board and plastic, for days, particularly under refrigerated (4℃) and frozen (-10 to -80℃) conditions [41] [42] [43] ; last, workers in wharf are infected through direct contact, and the virus once reach the human body, they can disseminate rapidly through human-to-human transmission [32] .\n"," In this review of the relevant outbreaks, patient zero was always the stevedore and usually asymptomatic. It is likely that the virus titer on the materials will gradually decline over time [29, 43] . Infection due to direct contact with the contaminated material is often mild or asymptomatic, and therefore the patients may not be motivated to seek medical treatment in the beginning; however, they can become the source of infection, through human-to-human transmission, to other vulnerable individuals. Patient zero is often hidden and difficult to detect, and the outbreak can only be perceived after a period of a secret epidemic.\n"," We realized that a positive nucleic acid testing does not necessarily mean the existence of an active transmission. On August 6, 2020, in Yingkou, Liaoning Province, three samples were found to be positive in the testing of outer packaging of the food products, but the nucleic acid as well as antibody testing on 43 employees and 306 related personnel J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of the enterprise were all negative [44] . To date, there have been no case reports of infection caused by eating or purchasing cold-chain products. According to the investigations of the outbreaks, the high-risk group is port staff, especially the stevedores, who may have direct contact with contaminated materials. Protecting workers from becoming infected with COVID-19 presents substantial challenges. These people should be placed on the top priority for immunization.\n"," In response to changes in the transmission routes, the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China promulgated a series of technical guidance at the national level for the prevention and control of COVID-19 transmission related to cold-chain food production in 2021 [45] . Benefitting from these policies, several outbreaks were detected before the occurrence of an epidemic.\n"," The focus of prevention and control therefore should not only focus on imported products but on the entire territory, not only on humans but also on materials. Our observations suggest that regular sampling and testing of high-risk groups and imported products and proper disinfection of imported products should be an effective way to detect and prevent the spread of the virus via such mode of transmission.\n"," The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

Keeping the civilization running requires continuous work on its maintenance. With the increasing reliance of the civilization on the information processing and computer power, the phenomenon of life began to be studied from the viewpoint of its information content [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Gorshkov [7] estimated the information processing capacity of the global biota from the rate of photosynthesis at 10 35 bit s −1 assuming that the biota computes at maximum possible efficiency of the order of kT ≈ 10 −21 Joules per bit [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . This exceeds the global computing capacity of the modern civilization by about fifteen orders of magntude. Recent estimates of computing efficiency in protein synthesis supported the proposition that living systems are fairly close to the Landauer limit and many orders of magnitude more efficient than modern computers [13] . Per unit surface area, the biota consumes two orders of magnitude less power but performs ten millions more operations per second than modern supercomputers demonstrating a billion times greater computing efficiency [14] .\n"," In Section 5, we discuss how the high energy consumption by modern civilization is unlikely a sign of high orderliness but a sign of unsteadiness warning of a potential collapse. In the final Section 7, we discuss how life's major organizing principle, persistence via ensuring genetic and environmental stability, gives the meaning to biological information. We discuss how big disruptive animals, humans, could nevertheless culturally evolve into the guardians of the biosphere and prolong its existence using the scientific analysis of the laws of life functioning and adopting behaviors respecting those fundamental laws.\n"," A more complete description of the biotic regulation concept can be found in Gorshkov [23] and Gorshkov et al. [25] , see also Gorshkov and Makarieva [26, 27, 28] . Here, we introduce its main propositions at the simplified background of the more conventional ideas about life, evolution, and environment (Figure 1a ). The key genetic information of life is assumed to be that about reproduction. Copying of genetic information occurs with errors (mutations), which ensure that all organisms in a population differ (genetic diversity). In any given environment, some organisms reproduce better than others, their genetic information predominantly propagates. The environment may experience random changes, and the criteria of selection it imposes on the organisms, change as well. This causes the genetic information of a species change with time, which on a larger scale constitutes biological evolution. (a) Main genetic information is about how to reproduce. Mutations that accumulate during reproduction (copying of genetic information) serve as an ultimate source for adaptive genetic diversity. The environment undergoes random changes. In a given environment, some individuals survive better than others; this represents natural selection. (b) Main genetic information is about how to stabilize the environment in an optimal state. The genetic information written in quantum molecular memory cells can be copied without errors (ageing). Classical objects (organisms) encoded by this information stabilize the environment compensating for external and internal perturbations. The optimal environment is the one where the genetic information that encodes this environment features maximum competitiveness. In other words, life encodes and maintains an environment where the algorithm that does so possesses maximum fitness. This qualitative picture does not explain the long-term persistence of life and leaves plenty of room for alternative visions. Indeed, as mutations accumulate in the course of copying of genetic information, some individuals with erroneous copies will, in a given environment, reproduce better than others, so there will always be a natural selection of some sorts. However, selection based on relative fitness will not guarantee that the absolute fitness, i.e., the ability of organisms to produce a sufficient amount of healthy progeny, will not decline with time. Indeed, while it has become clear that, in the human population, natural selection is too weak to prevent accumulation of mutational load [29] , it is not clear what general principles would guarantee the necessary efficiency of selection for other species of the biosphere. Besides genetic degradation, another opportunity for life to go extinct comes from the unpredictable, uncontrollable, and unfavorable environmental changes.\n"," A logical way to account for life's persistence without appealing to a lucky chance is to assume that life's basic information kit includes, as its key component, the information about how to regulate the external environment ( Figure 1b) . Governed by this program, living organisms impose a stabilizing impact on the environment keeping it in a state optimal for life's functioning. The notion of optimality presumes that, in this environment, those individuals that perform environmental regulation must be \"the fittest\". This condition of a simultaneous genetic and environmental homeostasis imposes strict constraints on the properties of the optimal environment.\n"," A comprehensive quantitative analysis of these constraints represents a distinct feature of the biotic regulation concept in comparison to other propositions of life's stabilizing environmental impacts, including the Gaia hypothesis [30] . Essentially, the optimal environment must be strongly non-equilibrium, such that, if left without biotic control, it would rapidly degrade to a state decreasing fitness of all organisms. This condition ensures that a mutant with eroded program of environmental regulation, even if initially competitive in the optimal environment, will be unable to spread globally as it will have rapidly destroyed its life-important resources.\n"," Evolution and environmental change are considered as first-order corrections to the main picture of life's homeostasis (Figure 1b) , see also Haldane [31] . Evolution occurs in the direction of a more efficient program of environmental regulation. Paraphrasing a well-known saying about evolution, one can say that nothing in life sciences makes sense except in the light of life's persistence.\n"," How can living organisms ensure persistence of non-equilibrium environmental conditions? The information about characteristics of the optimal environmental state has to be stored and copied. Since the environment of life is macroscopic, it represents a classical object that ages-changes irreversibly with time. Copying of classical objects is not possible without information loss; they undergo decay and are different at any point of time. Thus, the information about environmental conditions, as well as all other life's information, must be written using quantum carriers-objects that do not age and possess the property of identity.\n"," In most biological species, the information about life's complexity is written in the polymer molecules of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Total information written in these molecules constitutes a species' genome. Once this information is lost in extinct species, it cannot be recovered. From paleodata, we know about the dinosaurs, mammoths, and other extinct species. We also know about species driven to extinction by humans-Steller's cow, the dodo bird, the passenger pigeon, the elephant birds, and others. Their genomes are irreversibly lost and irrecoverable. No extinct species ever came into existence again. The paleodata also indicate that the majority of extant species did not change morphologically for millions of years [32] . It logically follows that their genetic program remained invariant as well [33] . Furthermore, all extant life shares a common ancestor, i.e., during the four billion years of life existence there was only one origin of persistent life.\n"," The genetic information can only be copied, not created anew. Copying requires energy expenditures that come from the external environment. Information of the polymer DNA molecules is written with use of four molecular letters-nucleotides. These four letters can bind into complementary pairs to form the double-stranded four-letter DNA molecule. As this molecule is to be copied, the double DNA strand unravels, and, on each of the two strands, the complementary part is synthesized. In the result, two identical DNA molecules are formed of two different cells belonging to one and the same or different individuals of the same species.\n"," During the copying process, errors may occur partially erasing the information DNA carries. These copying errors obey the well-known pattern of radioactive decay. In a characteristic time period (the half-life time), one half of the initial number of the copied molecular objects acquire some errors. The other half remains error-free and identical to the previous generation. This identity is what constitutes the quantum nature of life. If life did not possess this property, i.e., there were no identical copies produced during copying, it would have been impossible to sustain the orderliness of life.\n"," With the probability of point mutation affecting a given nucleotide pair of about ν = 10 −10 per cell division [34] and division frequency of the order of τ −1 = q/K, where q = 1 W kg −1 is the universal mass-specific metabolic rate and K = 4 × 10 6 J kg −1 is the energy content of living matter [28] , the genetic information of life would have melted completely in about τ/ν ≈ one billion years. The observed level of tolerated genetic polymorphism in biological species, about one mutation per 10 3 nucleotides, indicates that a loss of function occurs when about one thousandth of the total amount of information has been lost. This gives a time scale of genetic decay of about one million years. Incidentally, this is close to the mean time of species' existence [35, 36] . If the program of life contains information about how to recognize and delete the erroneous copies from the population, then it could be possible to maintain life's orderliness for an unlimited period of time-or at least to prolong its existence far beyond the half-life time of genetic information. The necessary condition is that erroneous copies should be deleted faster than they reproduce themselves. Again, this condition constrains the properties of the optimal environment where life could persist.\n"," Recognizing and deleting the erroneous copies cannot be realized on the quantum level of DNA molecules. Classical macroscopic organisms are required that are able to consume energy and matter from the environment and function on the basis of the genetic DNA program. Namely, in a population of such macroscopic classical individuals that all age, the program of recognizing and deleting the erroneous information copies can be realized. It is the most complex part of the genetic program itself. This statement is key to the biotic regulation concept. Competitive interaction and natural selection are not merely imposed on the population by an external environment being passive outcomes of the organism-environment interaction (cf. Figure 1a) . Instead, competitive interaction and natural selection represent the key part of the genetic program itself.\n"," This property is not captured in the studies of complexity maintenance by cellular automata e.g., [2, 3, 17] -there the program of selection is external and unrelated to the properties of the algorithm it selects. For example, in the well-known experiment of Mitchell et al. [17] , selection was set to favor the algorithms that correctly performed a certain calculation. This selection strategy got no feedback from the selected algorithms. More generally, among the many aspects studied by information theory in biological systems [37] , the crucial aspect of how life interacts with its environment is practically missing.\n"," Macroscopic physical processes in the Earth's environment do not copy each other but arise anew triggered by external energy flows, of which on Earth the most important one is the solar radiation. All life and civilization are maintained by the ordered solar radiation which is close to the blackbody radiation with temperature T S = 6000 K. The Earth receives solar energy in the form of massless photons. After these photons have perturbed the ground states of molecules on Earth, and the excited states relaxed back to the ground state, the solar photons turn to thermal photons with mean temperature T E = 300 K. The power of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth's surface undergoes decay to thermal radiation via a multitude of diverse channels provided by the living systems, civilization, and the inanimate nature of winds, oceanic currents, storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes.\n"," As the black body radiation consists of photons with mean energy kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant, each solar photon with mean energy kT S decays into approximately T S /T E = 20 thermal photons of the Earth with mean energy kT E . This decay of solar photons into thermal photons shape all events and determine the time of all processes on the Earth's surface. In most fields of theoretical physics, it is assumed that time is isotropic, which presumes that its direction can be reversed. The equations of motion in theoretical physics do not contain information about the decay of excited states of matter. These equations describe transitions of kinetic to potential energy and back for the two known long-range interactions, electromagnetic and gravitational. In the gravitational interaction, time defines the periods of potential-to-kinetic energy transitions, as in ideal pendulum, or rotation of interacting masses over elliptic orbits that characterize the energy of their interaction. In neither of these cases does anything change in the considered processes except the number of oscillations or rotations grows counted from an arbitrary initial state. This number is referred to as time. Thus, defined time does not have a direction and it can be reversed, i.e., it conforms to the condition of isotropy. The considered processes change if only one takes into account dissipation and decay of excited states.\n"," A major achievement of quantum physics consists in the discovery of the identity of the ground and excited states of atoms, molecules, and atomic nuclei. Two quantum objects being in the same states cannot be distinguished from one another. All excited states conform to the law of half-life time decay: starting from a certain initial number of identical excited states, since the so-called half-life time counted using the number of non-dissipating oscillations or rotations, the number of the excited states diminishes by half. The remaining excited states are identical to the initial excited states. The second half undergoes spontaneous or induced decay. Induced decay diminishes the half-life time, but does not change the pattern: there always remain states that have not undergone decay and are identical to the initial states. Those states that have not undergone decay do not change (\"wear\") or age. Only those states that have undergone decay age and wear. The half-life time is a fundamental constant equal for all specific states irrespective of their \"age\". Life is capable of selecting quantum programs with the smallest or optimal half-life time in the environment.\n"," Let us define time as the number of arbitrarily chosen non-dissipating oscillations or rotations that have occurred from the moment when a certain initial amount of ordered states capable of undergoing decay has been prepared, to the moment when they have all undergone decay. If a new excited state has not been prepared by then, the time disappears. The direction of time is uniquely related to the diminishing number of the excited states, and thus automatically relates the cause and consequence. The decay of an excited state is accompanied by release of energy that can be routed along the additional decay channels. The power of a process is equal to the energy of the half of the initial states that have undergone decay divided by the half-life time. An event is the process of decay of an ordered state capable of undergoing decay. If there is no decay, there is no time and no events. If the Sun had been sending the same radiation power but in the thermal part of the spectrum corresponding to T S = T E = 300 K, the Earth would have remained as warm as it is now, but the decay of solar radiation would have been impossible. No processes related to this decay, including the process of life, would be possible. Time would have stopped.\n"," The ordered states that can undergo decay are slowly prepared at the expense of the energy of solar radiation. In the absence of a program governing how they will decay, their decay occurs explosively and the diversity of the possible channels for energy transformation is limited. Rare classical macroscopic physical processes, like wind, rain, storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes, \"die\" and arise anew. They consume the available energy in an explosion-like manner and discontinue until new stores of energy arise in the environment. Molecular quantum copying sometimes spontaneously appears in the inanimate nature at the expense of previously accumulated energy which is likewise spent in an explosive manner (for example, in chemical reactions with catalysts or nuclear chain reactions). Such reactions do not lead to the formation of classical objects that recognize and delete erroneous copies. The explosion-like ordered processes in the inanimate nature discontinue as soon as the energy stores have been depleted, after which all objects that are being copied disappear.\n"," The combination of classical and quantum processes to ensure persistence uniquely differentiates life from the inanimate world. To account for the apparent absence of life elsewhere in the Universe, Chopra and Lineweaver [38] proposed that life may originate relatively often but evolves too slowly to gain control over the planetary environmental conditions. The life-compatible conditions are otherwise unstable and quickly deteriorate driving the \"non-regulating life\" to extinction. In comparison, from the biotic regulation viewpoint, a \"life\" that is not capable of controlling conditions perpetuating its persistence, is not a life. As we discussed, self-copying (reproduction) and metabolism (energy consumption) are common to many processes in the inanimate world.\n"," Life's persistence corresponds to a genetic program that suppresses the explosive energy consumption. A good example is provided by how the biota handles the phase transitions of water on Earth. Water vapor evaporation under the influence of solar radiation is a slow distributed process. Condensation of water vapor, in contrast, is governed by the vertical velocity of the ascending air (the faster it ascends, the faster it cools and moisture condenses), so it may occur at an arbitrarily high rate that exceeds by orders of magnitude the rate of evaporation. Such explosive-like release of energy takes the form of hurricanes and tornadoes that quickly deplete all water vapor previously accumulated in the atmosphere [39] , Table 1 . Over natural undisturbed forests on land, where the hydrological cycle is under biotic control, the spatial and temporal fluctuations of precipitation and wind are strongly suppressed [40] [41] [42] . The biota of the forest plants, fungi, and bacteria on land is able to slow down the rate of water vapor condensation sucking the ocean-evaporated moisture to land. The rates of evaporation and condensation become more equal, and there appears an opportunity of an uninterrupted time that follows the decay channels generated by life.\n"," Civilization slowed down the decay of uranium in nuclear fission reactions and uses them for energy production (Table 1) . Accidental loss of control over the slow-down leads to explosions at the nuclear power plants (Chernobyl, Fukushima). Civilization did not succeed in slowing down the decay of the prepared initial state in the thermonuclear fusion reaction. Consumption of fossil fuels by civilization has been exponentially increasing demonstrating explosion-like dynamics [43] . Destruction of the forest cover by civilization likewise proceeds in an explosion-like manner, with losses of the order of 100% over one tree life span [44] .\n"," The biomass of the immobile life persists due to the equality between the rates of synthesis and decomposition of organic matter by plants, bacteria, and fungi on land and in the ocean. Large animals including humans are able to destroy the biomass of plants at high rates that significantly exceed the slow rate of photosynthesis. The uninterruptedness of the time of life has been maintained because the share of biomass consumption by big animals remained small. If all synthesized biomass is consumed, in an explosion-like manner, by large animals and man, the uninterruptedness of time can be broken and the stability of life on Earth destroyed. Therefore, the uninterrupted time on Earth is determined by life in the decay channels that life itself regulates, i.e., it is a consequence of the existence of life. (Only within the volume of the Sun the thermonuclear reaction is slowed down at the expense of radiation emission that prevents the star from the gravitational collapse. It is the only slow-down of energy flow that is independent of life on Earth.) In what is to follow, we consider these statements in greater detail. Table 1 . \"Explosion\" and \"slow-down\" energy consumption patterns in the biota and civilization. [45] . Note that the total power of thermonuclear explosion of the Tsar Bomba is just about 20 times lower than the power output from the Sun's surface. The only known way to slowdown the thermonuclear reaction is to arrange the thermonuclear fuel within the Sun's volume. 3 The data are taken from [45] . 4 Average energy store per kilogram is twice as much as that in conventional fuel (1 kg of TNT∼4.2 × 10 6 J). The strategic stockpile of explosives in various forms is assumed to correspond to three months of use for explosions. The global average (and local) power of explosions is determined by using the time of explosion and average mass (∼1 kt) of the TNT exploded. The global power of TNT explosions is 10 13 J/[10 −6 s] = 10 19 W. 5 Energy store per kilogram of organic substance has the same order of magnitude as that in the fourth column. The global supply of fossil fuels is determined by the power consumption under the assumption that the strategic reserves of fossil fuels are equal to the 3-month consumption by civilization. Local and average power per unit of Earth's surface area is assumed to be equal to the power of cars; energy consumption of heating and industrial production are characterized by the same order of magnitude. The global power consumption of fossil fuels is known to be equal to 1.7 × 10 13 W. 6 In columns 6 and 7, energy consumption of plant biomass is considered with energy content K = 4 × 10 6 J kg −1 and global store of the order of 10 15 kg [46] assuming most land ecosystems are disturbed; fires consume 2 GtC yr −1 [47] , which constitutes 4% of primary productivity on land 56 GtC yr −1 [48] (7 × 10 13 W), which amounts to 3 × 10 12 W globally or 0.02 W m −2 for land on average. Wood consumption due to logging consumes globally about 0.3 GtC yr −1 [49] ; however, in many regions of the world, logging facilitates forest fires [47, [50] [51] [52] . Instantaneous power for forest fire is estimated as the power of blackbody radiation at 800 K as 10 4 W m −2 . Decay time for fires, 10 5 s = 1 day, is estimated as local biomass store in forests (∼200 kg m −2 ) multiplied by K = 4 × 10 6 J kg −1 and divided by instantaneous local fire power; instantaneous local power of energy consumption by big herbivores, 10 2 -10 3 W m −2 , is taken from Figure 4a ; their total energy consumption in unstable ecosystems may reach 100% primary productivity with a global average of 10% [28] . 7 In intact forests, fires are suppressed by vegetation cover controlling the water regime and occur less frequently than once in a thousand years compared to disturbed ecosystems when burning may occur every 10 years. This is reflected in the mean value of burnt areas, which for non-anthropogenic fires is two orders of magnitude smaller than for anthropogenic fires [50, 51] . Big herbivores in intact forests are allocated less than 1% of primary productivity (Figure 4b ). Global estimates are made assuming 10% of primary production on land from intact ecosystems. 8 Gravitational long-range interactions (via buoyancy and condensation-induced atmospheric dynamics [53] ) determine atmospheric dynamics. Explosion-like energy release in storms (hurricanes and tornadoes) is not controlled by the biota. The energy storage per unit mass is estimated from volume-specific energy storage ρ a V 2 = 10 4 J m −3 , where V∼10 2 m s −1 is wind velocity in the eyewall of the storm and ρ a = 1 kg m −3 is density of atmospheric air. Instantaneous power per unit surface area for storms is estimated as ρ a V 3 = 10 6 W m −2 . Energy storage in floods is gh = 50 J kg −1 , where h∼5 m is height of the surge, g = 9.8 m s −2 is the gravitational acceleration. Assuming that during the flood the water rises by h∼5 m in t = 5 days, the local flood power is ρgh(h/t) = 0.6 W m −2 , where ρ = 10 3 kg m −3 is density of liquid water. Mean global power for floods is estimated assuming that every flood lasts about 2t = 10 days and in one year the total globally affected area is about S f l = 10 6 km 2 [54] , ρgh(h/t)(2t/[1 year])S f l = 10 10 W. Total energy storage in floods ρgh 2 (2t/[1 year])S f l = 10 16 J. Total energy storage in storms is estimated assuming a storm lasting on average 10 days and there being globally 40 storms each year [55] with total energy ρ a V 2 HL 2 = 10 17 J, where H = 10 km is height of the atmosphere and L = 100 km is storm's radius where V 30 m s −1 . Total storm power is ρ a V 3 L 2 = 3 × 10 14 W, global surface-specific power density divides this number by the Earth's surface area S E . 9 The biotic pump mechanism regulates precipitation and winds. The dry air can ascend and descend in the atmosphere of Earth with zero net power expenditure; in contrast, water vapor condenses as it ascends, disappears from the gas phase and returns to the ground surface in the liquid or solid form. This water vapor disappearance from the gas phase creates a vertical pressure gradient (a deviation from the hydrostatic equilibrium) that acts as a vertical force pushing the air upward. Work of this force per unit time represents the power of the biotic pump air circulation [53] . The nearly instantaneous restoration of the hydrostatic equilibrium of the air occurs at the expense of the horizontal air inflow, mostly from the adjacent oceans. In a steady state, this incoming flow of moist air increases the precipitation rate over the forests by the magnitude of the river runoff. How to harmonize the fluxes of evaporation and precipitation such that their difference is equal to the amount of moisture needed to compensate the river runoff-at the same time minimizing the occurrences of hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts-represents one of the most complex processes of the biotic regulation of the environment. In intact forests, fluctuations of precipitaton are suppressed by the biotic pump mechanism [41, 42] . The energy store in the atmosphere is given by 10 3 Pa is partial pressure of atmospheric water vapor. Total store is given by the product of p v h γ S f o = 10 20 J, where h γ = 5 km is the scale height for the vertical distribution of relative partial pressure of water vapor in the gravitational field [53] and S f o = 10 13 m 2 is the total global area of intact forest landscapes [56] . Decay time is the turnover time of water in the atmosphere. Mean power of wind associated with condensation rate controlled by forests is\n"," is the universal gas constant and T∼300 K is absolute temperature. The estimate of local power assumes that precipitation events on average take about one tenth of the time. 10 Characteristics are estimated of the atomic bomb (Little Boy) dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. The bomb with mass of 4.4 t contained 64 kg of enriched uranium. Blast yield is 15 kt of TNT (63 × 10 12 J). Initial radius of explosion is taken as 100 m. 11 The fission of one atom of uranium-235 releases on average 200 MeV (3 × 10 −11 J) with taking into account the decay of its fragments or 83 × 10 12 J per kilogram of 235 U. For low-enriched uranium (3 to 5% concentration of uranium-235), which is usually used as fuel for thermal-neutron reactors at nuclear power plants, it corresponds to the energy storage of about 3 × 10 12 J per kilogram of uranium. Although uranium is quite widespread in nature, only a relatively small portion of it is concentrated in deposits that are economically profitable for industrial development and use in nuclear energetics. Identified resources in situ recoverable at a cost not exceeding 260 USD per kilogram of uranium are estimated to be ∼10 7 t [57] . Since natural uranium contains about 0.7% of fissile isotope 235 U, total storage of energy is given by 0.007 × 10 10 kg × 3 × 10 12 J/kg∼2 × 10 20 J. Presently, there are about 450 nuclear power reactors in operation worldwide with generating electric-power capacity of 4 × 10 11 W. The average efficiency of conversion of heat to electric power is about 30%. Total (global) power of nuclear reactors is estimated as 10 12 W, while the mean power per unit surface area is 10 12 W/[5 × 10 8 km 2 ]∼2 × 10 −3 W m −2 , where the Earth's surface area S E is taken into account. A typical nuclear power station generates electricity at a rate of ∼10 9 W. Taking into account that a nuclear reactor core has an effective radius of 3 m, one can estimate the local surface-specific power of nuclear reactor as 10 9 W/[3 m] 2 ∼10 8 W m −2 . Nuclear stations are designed for at least a 40-year operating life.\n"," In a search for quantitative criteria of life's orderliness and complexity, a proposition was put forward by Chaisson [18] , see also Chaisson [15, 19, 20] that evolutionary progress and an increase of complexity with time in both animate and inanimate nature is reflected in the magntiude of the energy rate density. Assuming, additionally, that \"complexity generally increases with evolution\" [19] , higher energy rate densities in organisms that appeared later in the evolution were interpreted as a correlation between energy rate density and complexity.\n"," Here, we reconsider these estimates and their more recent interpretations [13] to show that there is no evidence for any systematic large-scale changes in mass-or volume-specific energy rate density in the course of biological evolution. In the biological context, individual rate of energy consumption is called metabolic rate, so these terms will be used here interchangeably. In addition, since the density of living matter is close to the density of liquid water ρ = 10 3 kg m −3 , mass m and volume V in living objects are related as m = ρV, thus mass-and volume-specific rates differ by a constant ρ. Figure 2 Chaisson [15] summarized his previous estimates, according to which the more complex plants with their metabolic rate of about 1 W kg −1 evolved from the more primitive protists that presumably had a lower metabolic rate of about 0.1 W kg −1 . The latter figure was obtained by Chaisson [18] (p. 138), see also Chaisson [20] , for the biosphere as a whole by dividing the global rate of photosynthesis F by global plant mass. Using modern data, this estimate can be obtained as\n"," Here, M = 450 GtC is the total plant mass in the biosphere in carbon units [46] , F = 200 GtC yr −1 is the global gross primary productivity, K C = 42 × 10 6 J (kgC) −1 is the energy content of organic matter [58] . Chaisson [20] used a lower value for plant biomass, 1200 Gt instead of 450 GtC ≈ 4500 Gt and a lower value for the biosphere energy consumption (10 21 erg s −1 = 10 14 W instead of FK C = 3 × 10 14 W) to obtain q b = 9 × 10 −2 W kg −1 .\n"," Chaisson [15] Figure 2 , see also Table 3 of Chaisson [19] , Figure 6 of Chaisson [20] , attributed q b = 0.1 W kg −1 to protists and referred to it as \"valid for the great majority of Earth's lower plant life\". In Table 3 of Chaisson [19] , it is stated that examples of such low energy rate density is provided by \"phytoplankton, algae.\" This is incorrect. The low value of q b (1) is due to the fact that most part of plant biomass is wood, which is metabolically inactive e.g., [46, 59] . Wood performs mechanical functions not related to the biochemical energy conversion. To estimate the energy consumption of plants per unit wood mass is similar to estimating the energy consumption of birds per unit mass of their nests or energy consumption of the civilization per unit mass of buildings. In the ocean, plants lack such metabolically inactive parts. Global biomass of oceanic phytoplankton M p ≈ 1.3 GtC is several hundred times lower than M. With gross primary production of the ocean about F p ≈ F/2 ≈ 100 GtC yr −1 , mean mass-specific photosynthetic rate of phytoplankton is\n"," This value for phytoplankton is significantly higher than the values quoted by Chaisson [15] [ Figure 2 and references therein] for the higher plants like gymnosperms and angiosperms (0.5-1 W kg −1 ). It falls on the upper range of mass-specific metabolic rates of life as a whole ( Figure 2 ) and coincides with the metabolic rate of human brain, which in young healthy adults constitutes around 1.3 µmol O 2 min −1 g −1 [60, 61] , which corresponds to 10 W kg −1 assuming 20 J (ml O 2 ) −1 .\n"," Direct measurements of metabolic rates in phytoplankton and protists confirm that these organisms do not have lower metabolic rates than the higher plants and animals ( Figure 2) . Notably, even if we calculate the metabolic rate of higher plants per unit mass of their photosynthetic tissue, still for plants on land we obtain a mean figure of about 1 W kg −1 , since the biomass of green leaves is about ten times larger than phytoplankton biomass Supplementary Information Bar-On et al. [46] , while gross primary productivity on land is about the same as it is in the ocean. This is also consistent with direct estimates of respiration rates in green leaves (Figure 2 ). Metabolic portrait of life in terms of whole-body metabolic rate Q (W) and mass-specific metabolic rate q (W kg −1 ) of individual organisms and their brains. Pink shading denotes the proposed optimal range for life's functioning, approximately between 1 and 10 W kg −1 [58, 62] . Red solid lines are the allometric dependencies of q on body mass m for groups of heterotrophic species from Table 1 of Makarieva et al. [58] , gray dotted lines are the same dependencies for Q = qm. The thinner red line for Protozoa represents starved cells from Ikeda [63] [58] . Green solid line is the mass-specific rate of dark respiration in green leaves depending on leaf thickness l calculated from the data of Wright et al. [64] . Linear size l (upper horizontal axis) and body mass m (lower horizontal axis) relate as l = (m/ρ) 1/3 . The dependencies for the mass-specific brain metabolic rate in ectotherms and endotherms on body mass (measured in vivo, violet solid line, and estimated indirectly, violet dashed lines) are constructed using the data of Mink et al. [65] . See Section 6 for details.\n"," In a more recent analysis, Kempes et al. [13] recognized that there is no consistent change of mass-specific metabolic rate across all life. Kempes et al. [13] wrote that while \"multicellular life obeys a certain economy of scale: as organisms grow larger, the metabolic rate required to support a unit of mass is decreasing and larger mammals support more tissues for the same amount of energy\", more recently \"it has been observed that this scaling relationship is not preserved across all the taxa of life.\" Indeed, Makarieva et al. [58] established that \"mean metabolic rates of major taxonomic groups...converge on...a remarkably small range compared with the 4000-to 65,000-fold difference between the mean metabolic rates of the smallest and largest organisms that would be observed if life as a whole conformed to universal quarter-power or third-power allometric scaling laws.\" The dataset of Makarieva et al. [58] included a large compilation of prokaryote metabolic rates that had not been previously analyzed. Namely, these data for the smallest organisms allowed the generalizations about the metabolic portrait of life to be made.\n"," Kempes et al. [13] did not cite the study of Makarieva et al. [58] , but referred to DeLong et al. [66] who used the data of Makarieva et al. [58] for bacteria, converted them from mass-specific to whole-body basis and observed that the scaling exponent in bacteria, listed in Table 1 of Makarieva et al. [58] , becomes greater than unity when the allometry is expressed per whole-body mass. Converting those data back to the mass-specific basis, Kempes et al. [13] discussed how the scaling exponent changes with growing body size of the organisms, noting that q first grows with size in prokaryotes, then it remains relatively constant in protists and then declines in larger organisms ( Figure 2) .\n"," However, Makarieva et al. [58] emphasized that the methodological inaccuracy of measuring the link between organismal size and metabolic rate is profoundly different in the unicellular versus the multicellular organisms. In unicells, especially in prokaryotes, it is common to measure metabolic rate of a unit mass (e.g., taking 1 g dry mass of the bacterial suspension). Cell size is not simultaneously measured. Makarieva et al. [58] see Supplementary Information retrieved cell sizes from independent sources, often estimating cell mass from linear cell size. This procedure does not impact the value of mass-specific metabolic rate, but it should profoundly impact the dependence between mass-specific metabolic rate and cell size, especially given that the size of bacterial cells can change depending on their nutrition status (growth, starvation, etc.). This source of error is absent in larger organisms, where metabolic rate is commonly measured on a whole-body basis simultaneously with the body mass.\n"," DeLong et al. [66] and Kempes et al. [13] did not assess the uncertainty associated with the poorly known cell sizes of unicellular organisms; at the moment, their conclusion about the difference in the scaling exponents between prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and higher organisms lacks statistical significance and cannot be meaningfully interpreted. A more up-to-date analysis of Ikeda [63] controlling for the physiological state in Protozoa indicates a decline in mass-specific metabolic rate with growing body size that is not distinguishable from what is observed in the groups of larger organisms (Figure 2 , thin red line).\n"," In summary, given that the low q b (1) assumed to characterize the lower life forms in the analyses of Chaisson [15] and previous work appears to be a miscalculation, while phytoplankton q p (2) falls instead on the upper border of all life energy rate densities, little support remains for a progressive increase in energy rate densities or any other consistent change in metabolic allometry with evolution ( Figure 2 ), see also analyses by Ikeda [63] , Johnson et al. [67] , Kiørboe and Hirst [68] , Hatton et al. [69] .\n"," Instead, since within evolutionary close groups of organisms the mass-specific metabolic rate declines with growing body size, while evolution tends to produce larger body sizes from smaller ones, the more recently evolved bigger forms within a group face the danger of leaving the life's metabolic optimum range of 1-10 W kg −1 [58] . Once this happens, the bigger forms with low q could lose competitiveness and be forced out from the biosphere if a new group in the same body size interval evolves that has managed to elevate its rate back to the optimal range. In this context, Chaisson [15] 's proposition that endotherms who elevated their q rates above those of the similarly sized ectotherms might have been more evolutionarily advanced, at least in some aspects, remains meaningful. Figure 3 displays the interplay between metabolic optimality and ecological dominance by comparing two groups of species, lizards [70] and mammals [69, 71] . The green squares indicate population energy consumption of several hundred populations of mammalian species world over (mostly mainland) with a geometric mean of 3 × 10 −4 W m −2 and half of all values confined between 0.9 × 10 −4 and 12 × 10 −4 W m −2 . (Population energy consumption J is equal to population density (individuals per unit area or inverse area per one individual) multiplied by individual metabolic rate Q, J = NQ, see Methods). The red circles in Figure 3a show 198 lizard populations on the mainland, i.e., where the reptiles have to co-exist with mammals. The geometric mean energy consumption rate of a mainland lizard population is 2 × 10 −5 W m −2 with half of all values confined between 0.4 × 10 −5 and 14 × 10 −5 W m −2 . The population energy consumption by mammals is more than an order of magnitude higher than that of mainland lizards. On the ecosystem level, lizards are precluded from claiming the same amount of energy resources as mammals. Things turn different on isands, where the competition with mammals is significantly reduced [70] . The blue circles in Figure 3b show population energy consumption in 148 island populations of lizards-compared to the mainland, it rises to 3 × 10 −4 W m −2 with half of all values confined between 0.7 × 10 −4 and 16 × 10 −4 W m −2 . Remarkably, the geometric mean values of population energy consumption in mammals and island lizards practically coincide. These data are consistent with the idea that the metabolically suboptimal lizards lose to mammals in the competition for ecosystem energy resources but re-gain their share of resources where this competition weakens or disappears altogether.\n"," During evolution, the endotherms could have forced out some of the ectotherms with suboptimal metabolic rates (Figure 2 ) from their ecological niches causing their extinction-either by themselves or at the backstage of major environmental cataclysms. (For example, the metabolically 'sub-optimal' dinosaurs, whose metabolic levels continue to be debated, see e.g., [72] [73] [74] and references therein, could have been outcompeted by the evolutionarily young metabolically optimal mammals.) Figure 3 illustrates a \"metabolic footprint\" of how this could have happened. Further insights into ecological dominance and metabolic optimality are provided by consideration of individual surface-specific energy consumption rates as dependent on the organism's body size.\n"," If, generally, the volume-and mass-specific metabolic rate q is size-invariant across life (Figure 2) , then the surface-specific metabolic rate (or surface-specific energy rate density) j = Q/S = qρl 3 /l 2 = ρql, where S is the area of the organism's projection on the ground surface, should grow linearly with linear size l of the organism. The flux of energy via the body surface of the smallest organisms like 1 µm bacteria is about 10 −3 W m −2 , while the biggest organisms like endotherms consume up to 10 3 W m −2 (Figure 4a ). In between lie the characteristic values of net primary productivity P∼1 W m −2 that plants generate using the energy of solar photons. The critical linear size l c = P/(ρq)∼10 −3 m divides all life into the small and the big, the immotile and the locomotive, the ecologically sustainable and the ecologically unstable [28, 62] . Figure 2 . The dashed line shows a characteristic value of primary productivity P = 1 W m −2 ; (b) share β of ecosystem energy flux consumed by heterotrophs from a given body size interval in stable ecosystems on land (dashed contour histogram) [28, 62] and in the ocean (solid contour histogram) [75] . The lower β values for the largest organisms in the ocean compared to land might be related to over-fishing, which reduced fish biomass in some body size intervals by at least an order of magnitude see, e.g., [76] . Note the logarithmic scale of the vertical axis in (b).\n"," Organisms of linear size smaller than l c consume less power than the biosphere is able to generate, j = ρql < P, per unit area of their projection on the Earth's surface (∼l 2 ). Such organisms do not need to move actively or destroy live plants. They can satisfy their energetic needs by sitting and waiting for the dead plant parts falling down to become their food. Like plants themselves, such organisms can form a continuous cover, e.g., in the form of bacterial mats or fungi mycelia.\n"," Conversely, species larger than the critical body size cannot sit and wait. They require more food per unit area per unit time than the biosphere is able to produce. Such organisms have to move collecting biomass synthesized by plants over a large home territory H exceeding their body projection area S = l 2 by many orders of magnitude, H S. Importantly, these bigger locomotive organisms must feed on live plant biomass. Indeed, at any moment of time, they occupy only a tiny portion S/H 1 of their feeding territory and thus cannot compete for dead plant biomass with the immobile heterotrophs (bacteria and fungi) that are ubiquitously present. This explains the pattern noted by Cebrian [77] that vertebrate (i.e., bigger) detritivores are rare and their role is insignificant. The smallest heterotrophs, on the other hand, should preferentially consume dead plant biomass (i.e., they should be detritivorous) because live plants defend themselves biochemically, and it would be costly to overcome their defense. The bigger organisms have no choice but to accept these costs.\n"," Plants represent the energetic basis for ecosystem functioning-indeed, \"the removal of primary producers leaves no system at all\" [78] . As the bigger organisms consume live plant biomass, the big herbivores as an ecological and evolutionary group present a persistent threat to ecosystem stability. Fires also consume live plant biomass at a rate that is comparable to herbivores in disturbed ecosystems ( Table 1 , column 6) representing some of the more voracious \"plant-feeders\" [79] . However, unlike living organisms, fires do not evolve. Thus, a natural ecosystem can in principle evolve to a state where it becomes resistant to fires \"once and for all\", by employing efficient water retention and moisture transport mechanisms. Meanwhile any resistance the plants would evolve against herbivores, e.g., [79] Figure 2d ,e, can be in principle overcome by evolution of the big herbivores themselves. This does not mean that any big herbivore the evolution has produced will destroy its own ecosystem by overfeeding. However, there are no general ecological, biological, or physical laws that would prohibit the occasional self-destructive increase in population numbers of big herbivores.\n"," Persistent, stable ecosystems, both on land and in the ocean that apparently managed to keep population densities of big herbivores in check allocate a very low portion of total ecosystem flux to the biggest organisms (Figure 4b) . The largest share of ecosystem productivity (80-90%) goes via the detrital channel of the smallest heterotrophs, bacteria, fungi, and eukaryotic unicells. These organisms keep their mass-specific metabolic rates within the optimal range ( Figure 2 ) and do not exceed the critical linear size l c associated with ecological instability (Figure 4a ). Together with plants, they represent the main working unit of life whose functioning is stabilized in accordance with the law of large numbers.\n"," Invertebrates of intermediate size are still metabolically optimal (Figure 2 ), but their size is already supercritical (Figure 4a ). These organisms are allocated a smaller share of about 10% of ecosystem energy flux (Figure 4b) . Finally, the biggest organisms, vertebrates, have fallen out of the optimal metabolic range and increased their body size by two orders over the critical l c . This double suboptimality is associated with the lowest share of ecosystem energy flux (less than 1%) allocated to these organisms in stable conditions (Figure 4b) .\n"," Recently in a discussion of the ecological role of big animals opened in the Russian Journal of Ecosystem Ecology, e.g., [75, [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] Hatton and Galbraith [86] suggested that the idea of an ecological and environmental disruption associated with big animals might be in contradiction with the approximate constancy of population energy consumption observed in different-sized vertebrate species, as established by Hatton et al. [69] [their Figure 2E ]. To address this criticism, we first note that the pattern shown in Figure 4b is consistent with the data of Hatton et al. [69] and Hatton and Galbraith [86] . Indeed, share β of ecosystem energy flux consumed by all organisms in a given body size interval is equal to\n"," where N i (m −2 ) is population density of the i-th species, Q (W) is whole-body metabolic rate of individuals in this species, β i = N i Q i /P is population energy consumption of the i-th species, n is the total number of species in the considered body size interval, and P (W m −2 ) is ecosystem primary productivity. If population energy consumption β i is independent of body size, as Figure 2E of Hatton et al. [69] suggests, the decline of β with increasing body size will occur at the expense of the declining number n of the bigger species (e.g., in most ecosystems, there are more species of rodents than of big ungulates), as also recognized by Hatton and Galbraith [86] . (Note that if N i is expressed in ind m −2 , Q should be expressed in W ind −1 and body mass m in kg ind −1 such that the relationship between whole-body Q and mass-specific q metabolic rates, Q = qm, is preserved.) Furthermore, any global compilation of β i = N i Q i /P necessarily includes population density data from significantly perturbed ecosystems including some overgrazed nature reserves in Africa [87] . In such ecosystems, population energy consumption by big animals can be artificially elevated by providing extra food to the protected species. Controlling for the degree of anthropogenic disturbance may change the size-related pattern for β i from the current size-invariance towards lower values at larger body sizes. Makarieva et al. [87] using the data of Damuth [71] showed that the scaling of N i is different in open (savanna, presumably less stable) versus closed (forests, presumably more stable) ecosystems: in closed canopy ecosystems, N i declines more rapidly with growing body size.\n"," (We note in passing that in their pan-eukaryotic compilation of N i Q i estimates Hatton et al. [69] included multicellular plants, which, unlike the remaining species of the biosphere, are known to contain large amounts of metabolically inactive structural tissues (wood). This raises the problem of defining the metabolically relevant whole-plant mass, which is smaller than total plant mass. Relocating the relatively high plant β i towards smaller body sizes in Figures 2E and 1C of, respectively, Hatton et al. [69] and Hatton and Galbraith [86] , would have made the overall dependence of N i Q i on body size across all eukaryotes more negative.)\n"," Finally, the logic of Hatton and Galbraith [86] 's objection that big animals are not dangerous since their share of consumption declines with body size such that they may not claim all ecosystem productivity does not contradict the statement that big animals are potentially dangerous. As long as big animals are confined within the ecological corridor of relatively low β as outlined in Figure 4b , they do not pose a threat to the ecosystem functioning; the ecosystem is balanced. However, since big herbivores are physiologically selected to destroy live plants, it appears to be just a matter of time when a big species with a sufficiently destructive potential arises in the course of evolution. Homo sapiens appears to be a conspicuous example [88] .\n"," While there is no general increase in energy rate density q in plants and animals to \"parallel the emergence of major evolutionary stages on the scale of life's history\" cf. [15] , the human civilization does consume a relatively large amount of energy per unit time per unit live mass. For 2015, the global energy consumption P c = 17 × 10 12 W (550 quadrillion btu per year) [43] divided by cumulative mass of all human bodies M h = 4 × 10 11 kg [46] gives q c = P c /M h = 43 W kg −1 for the modern civilization. This is more than an order of magnitude higher than a typical q h ≈ 1.5 W kg −1 of the human body. In countries consuming several times more energy power than the global average, the ratio q c /q h may well reach 200.\n"," Do those high energy rate densities, q c ∼10 2 W kg −1 , testify for an increased complexity and evolutionary advancement our civilization could be proud of? Our species appears to be using so much energy because a certain part of the Homo sapiens population was historically forced out of their natural ecological niche (a warm tropical climate with a high biological productivity). With technological progress they have attempted to recreate the \"paradise\" conditions in a significantly more hostile and less productive environment of the higher latititudes [14] . This requires a lot of energy.\n"," However, such elevated rates are not unprecedented in the living world. Growing bacteria and animal tissues during peak activity, e.g., during flight, consume energy at rates of up to several thousand Watts per kilogram [89] . However, living organisms do not normally maintain such rates for a prolonged period of time. This indicates that such levels of energy consumption are not sustainable in the long term.\n"," Likewise, while global rates of synthesis and decomposition of organic matter in the biosphere balance each other with a high accuracy ensuring life's persistence in the long term, the energy consumption of the modern civilization mostly derives from fossil fuels that are not renewable. All major mineral and energy resources that our civilization consumes at an ever increasing rate are in decline. Unlike in the rest of life, here we are apparently dealing with an unsteady process of an explosion-like exponentially accelerating energy consumption that will end in the depletion of energy resources and the collapse of the corresponding energy-consuming structure. The instantaneous unsteady rate of energy consumption can be significantly higher than our civilization's q c in many processes like nuclear bomb explosions that cannot claim high orderliness (Table 1) . Biospheric processes, in contrast, are characterized by a slow-down of potentially explosion-like processes. In particular, the biotic control of water vapor condensation in natural forests stabilizes the terrestrial water cycle against such weather extremes with explosion-like energy release as hurricanes and tornadoes [39, 40, 42] .\n"," Per unit surface area, the energy consumption of our civilization J c = P c /S E = 0.03 W m −2 , S E = 5 × 10 14 m 2 , is about an order of magnitude lower than the global gross photosynthetic power on Earth FK C /S E ∼0.6 W m −2 . However, it exceeds the ecologically permissible energy quota for animals of human size by more than an order of magnitude (Figure 4b) , illustrating the significant disruptive potential of our species with respect to destabilising the biosphere. (Direct consumption of primary productivity of the biosphere (food, cattle fodder, wood) by humans appears, in power units, to be of the same order of magnitude as consumption of fossil fuels which mostly determines J c [90] . Fires provide a similar disturbance removing annually about 4% of net primary productivity on land (Table 1) .)\n"," The structure of anthropogenic energy consumption reveals its low information content. About one third of all energy flow is spent on transport. Transport vehicles represent macroscopic objects whose behavior can be characterized by just a few variables like the velocity vector of its movement. Its environmental function consists of consuming petrol and releasing carbon dioxide. In contrast, the continuous cover of plants and immobile heterotrophs covering the Earth's surface consists of microscopic memory cells that independently censor environmental conditions on a fine scale and react to environmental perturbations in a non-random way. Each such cell possesses an information-processing capacity comparable with that of a modern personal computer [7] . For example, the functioning of soil biota can change the life-time of organic compounds turning normally short-lived substances like proteins (that rapidly degrade under laboratory conditions) into long-lived ones and vice versa [91] . The meaning of \"Once there were bacteria, now there is New York\" may be precisely the opposite to what this phrase is usually invoked to imply [5] .\n"," Generally, living organisms impose control over their external environment via the surface of their bodies. With the growing size of compact animal bodies, the relative number of body cells that are in contact with the external milieu diminishes inversely proportionally to linear body size l:\n"," where S = l 2 and V = l 3 are the animal body area and volume, s = l 2 cell and v = l 3 cell are the mean area and volume of cells in the animal body.\n"," For large animals cells that interact with the external environment represent a negligible proportion of total body cells, e.g., η = 10 −4 for l = 0.5 m and l cell = 50 µm. Information flux in the animal body is proportional to total energy consumption of the animal. The larger the animal, the smaller the share of its information flux it can spend to participate in the biotic regulation of the external environment which allows for its very existence. Large animals use the available fluxes of energy and information almost exclusively to maintain the orderliness of their internal milieu rather than the external environment [14] . Failure to process environmental information at a sufficient rate leads to ecological misbehavior and demise. In certain aspects, this can be compared to the economic phenomenon of a decline of big monopolies that focus too much on themselves while paying insufficient attention to, and failing to predict, the market trends their smaller competitors eagerly monitor [92] .\n"," When large animals begin to dominate the ecosystem, the environment left without biotic control rapidly degrades. As it degrades, so does the efficiency of competitive interaction, which can no longer stabilize the genetic information of life. Thus, the spontaneous occurence, in the course of evolution, of yet bigger life's forms may not represent some evolutionary advancement, but, on the contrary, can be manifestation of degradation (ageing) of life's algorithm as a whole. Life is trying to counteract this decay process by limiting the energy resources allocated to big animals ( Figure 4b ).\n"," When these limits are overcome by whatever reason, the environment degrades locally ( Figure 5 ) or globally depending on the spatial scale where the limits have been broken. \n"," The dependence reported by Wright et al. [64] Table 1 and Supplementary Information, log 10 (q d /q d ) = −1.04 log 10 (LMA/LMA), where q d and LMA are, respectively, the rate of dark respiration per unit dry leaf mass and dry leaf mass per unit leaf surface area, q d = 9.7 nmol O 2 (g dry mass) −1 s −1 , LMA = 128 (g dry mass) m −2 , corresponds to log 10 (q/q) = −1.04 log 10 (l/l), where q is the rate of dark respiration per unit live mass and l is leaf thickness estimated from LMA, q = 1.45 W kg −1 , l = 4.3 × 10 −4 m. (Assuming 30% dry mass content in live mass and live matter density ρ = 10 6 g m −3 , we have l [m] = LMA/0.3 [(g dry mass) m −2 ]/ρ; assuming 20 J per 1 ml O 2 [58] we have q [W kg −1 \n"," The data for starved Protozoa from Ikeda [63] , Table S1 -1 (thin red line in Figure 2 ) were corrected to 25 • C assuming Q 10 = 2 as in Makarieva et al. [58] by multiplying the original metabolic rates by 2 (25 • C−T)/10 • C , where T is the measurement temperature in degrees Celsius. Note that, in Table S1 -1 of Ikeda [63] , the wet mass of cells is mistakenly represented in nanograms (10 −6 mg), it should be picograms instead (10 −9 mg) to match the (correct) values for cell volumes. Data for starved cells correspond to those rows in Table S1 -1 of Ikeda [63] , where variables \"GR\" and \"UNS\" are both zeros.\n"," The violet solid line in Figure 2 describes five mammalian species where oxygen consumption of the brains was measured in vivo [65] Figure 1 , the violet dashed lines also include the remaining indirectly obtained estimates from Table 1 of Mink et al. [65] .\n"," In Figure 3 , lizard population densities N (m −2 , an inverse area per one individual) and body masses m were taken from Appendix S1 of Novosolov et al. [70] (148 island and 198 mainland populations). Mammalian population densities N and body masses m were taken from the Supplementary Data of Hatton et al. [69] (2663 populations for 608 species). Given the highly uneven numbers of populations studied for different mammal species, a mean population density for each mammalian species was estimated by taking a geometric mean of all population densities for the considered species. To obtain population energy consumption J = NQ (W m −2 ), each lizard population density and each mean mammalian population density were multiplied by field metabolic rate Q f (W) as established by Nagy [93] for reptiles, Q f /Q 0 = 0.196(m/m 0 ) 0.889 , and mammals, Q f /Q 0 = 4.82(m/m 0 ) 0.734 , respectively, where Q 0 = 1 kJ day −1 = 0.0116 W, m 0 = 1 g.\n"," Note the relationship between population energy consumption J = NQ and individual surface-specific energy consumption j = ρql = Q/S (Figure 4a) , where S = l 2 is the projection area of the individual on the ground surface: J = jSN.\n"," We have considered several key statements of the biotic regulation of the environment that views life and environment as inseparable entities. In closed non-equilibrium systems, entropy diminishes. In open non-equilibrium systems that consume ordered energy, entropy may remain constant and the systems can be stabilized in the non-equilibrium state as long as this energy inflow is available. For example, as long as solar energy generates the fluxes of evaporation from the oceanic surface, there will be hurricanes.\n"," However, for living systems, their order (measured as the stabilization of the genetic information against decay) is not directly related to the availability of external energy supply. If the organism does not eat, it will die. However, even if it does eat, it will die. This allows the formulation of a constraint on the information entropy [6] : if the external energy flow is low ordered compared to the information carrier, the information content can be stabilized if and only if this information carries a program of such stabilization. The measure of how disordered external energy is as compared to the ordered object in question is provided by the probability of spontaneous arisal of this object in the presence of this energy. Unlike hurricanes, living objects never arise spontaneously.\n"," The genetic program of life must carry a subunit about how to recognize and delete the copies with erroneous information. The process of recognition of erroneous copies represents a measurement. This measurement is performed by classical objects (individuals) that all age and die. The deletion of erroneous copies must involve their deprivation of essential resources like energy. Thus, the efficiency of the stabilization program depends on the environmental properties ( Figure 1 ). Under conditions of unlimited resource abundance, the deletion of erroneous copies (and defective individuals) from the population would be impossible [28] . Individuals incapable of environmental regulation will propagate at the expense of consuming the available resources until they force out all \"regulators\", after which the biotic regulation discontinues and the environment degrades.\n"," A theoretical question is whether it is possible to conceive a program that will sustain itself eternally (provided the solar energy flux and other basic planetary characteristics remain constant). This is not obvious. The appearance of big animals, and generally the body size growth in the course of evolution, shows that, when the cells of the multicellular body act in concert (mutually correlated), they can at least sometimes outcompete the small organisms that represent independent individuals. This increase in individual competitive capacity comes hand in hand with the ability of large animals to destroy live plant biomass ( Figure 5) .\n"," Apparently, both in the ocean and on land, the large-scale evolutionary increase in body size-from unicellular organisms to multicellular invertebrates to yet bigger vertebrates-was paralleled with a decline of the share of ecosystem energy consumption allocated to them-from, respectively, ∼100% to ∼10% to ∼1% (Figure 4b) . It is most pronounced in the ocean [75] , where there are no large primary consumers: the biggest animals reside at the top of the food pyramid with extremely low population energy consumption.\n"," The energetic deprivation of the biggest animals, and the destabilization their high population numbers can invoke, suggest that the spontaneous increase in body size during life's evolution may represent a drawback of the life's algorithm as a whole, a sign of its ageing and losing order. Given that the key function of life is to maintain an environment where it can stabilize itself, big animals with their low surface-to-volume ratio are unable to perform efficient environmental regulation but are potentially capable of destruction.\n"," Brains, and the human brain in particular, are tissues that display a close to optimum volume-specific energy rate density ( Figure 2) . Apparently, having discovered external energy resources, the humanity has found itself in a temporary state of energy abundance and has been so far disturbing and destroying the biosphere. However, it is in principle possible that with use of their metabolically optimal brains humans will realize the principles of life stability and implement them into their culture. The danger of resource abundance for population organization has been intuitively recognized in some cultures, whereby the belongings of the deceased are destroyed preventing the accumulation of wealth [94] . However, a scientific recognition of the danger of abundance is required. If this is done, then the degradation of life could be stopped via human knowledge.\n"," The biotic regulation concept gives meaning to the information content of the genome: the information makes sense if it fits the general program of keeping the environment stable. This information can be copied infinitely without loss as it is written on quantum carriers (DNA molecules) that do not age. The combination of quantum and classical properties is a distinct feature of life as compared to processes in the inanimate nature. In modern computers, programs are written on macroscopic non-quantum memory cells. Errors that arise in these programs do not obey the quantum law of radioactive decay. This copying does not necessarily produce identical copies. Technical problems or improper handling of physical data carriers can lead to disappearance of all copies. However, program users are able to recognize and delete erroneous, virus-affected programs and by doing so they act as the classical individuals in the natural biota.\n"," The modern civilization is in this context fully classical. It does not contain any quantum program of the stationary norm and how to prevent decay. Life, on the other hand, does not contain any information about the stationary state of the civilization. In the inanimate nature, there cannot be sustainable development; there is only the decay of an ordered state that determines the direction of time. The irreversibility of time is manifested in the impossibility of creating perpetuum mobiles of the second kind-one cannot get work from heat at the same temperature. In the living nature there is only one example of sustainable development-it is the programmed development of an embryo from the egg or a plant from the seed. This development occurs strictly in line with the genetic program of the species that determines the decay channels for energy transformations; and which processes must occur at each stage. The normal process of development, as well as deviations from the norm, are well defined. This sustainable development according to the genetic program formed during the billions of years of biological evolution culminates in the stationary life stage of the adult individual. This life continues for a known period of time and ends with the decay and death of the individual. For most species, the biosphere provides sustainable conditions for the development of all generations of organisms for several million years.\n"," In contrast to biological species, human civilization does not have a program of sustainable development. Such a program can be created only on the basis of fundamental research. In a broad sense, sustainable development of the civilization can be understood as a steady-state process of cultural change: the civilization continues to evolve culturally (in particular, scientifically and technologically), but the environmental conditions persist that enable all generations to thrive [95] [96] [97] . Currently, attempts at climate stabilization are primarily based on technology and aimed at mitigating carbon dioxide emissions. Meanwhile, protection and conservation of natural ecosystems are viewed as a related but separate goal. Reflecting this duality, there are different international organizations dealing with the presumably different sets of problems, e.g., the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services [98] . The biotic regulation concept indicates that environmental sustainability cannot be achieved without understanding and quantifying the genetically encoded regulatory functions of the natural ecosystems. A wide international effort is needed to study the stabilizing climate impact of the still remaining least disturbed natural ecosystems [99] [100] [101] . Long-term climate stability, and thus sustainability on a planetary scale, is contingent upon the existence of vast areas where natural ecosystems are allowed to operate maintaining the environmental conditions in a suitable for life state. \n","Score: 10.394193740541322\n","\n","Title: Why Italian ENT physicians should be aware of SARS-CoV-2 Perchè gli specialisti ORL italiani devono stare in guardia contro SARS-CoV-2\n","Body Text: Dear Editor, at this time our country is perturbed by the outbreak of the so-called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is imposing our government and health authorities to adopt stringent measures in order to control the disease and limit its diffusion. This condition has been declared by the WHO the sixth public health international emergency after H1N1 in 2009, polio in 2014, Ebola in 2014 in West Africa, Zika and Ebola in 2019 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the emergence of this new infection in December 2019 in China, it rapidly diffused to other countries, with the development of new infectious foci in Lombardy and Veneto at the end of February 2020. At the time of writing, more than 101,900 cases have been confirmed worldwide with more than 3,700 new cases developing in the last 24 hours 1 . Italy is currently the first among the most affected European countries, with about 4,630 cases and more than 770 new cases detected in the last 24 hours (of 07 March 2020) 1 . Epidemiological observations suggest a constant increase in the daily number of global cases (both in China and outside it), with a decreasing trend in new cases in China but not in other countries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; which is mainly located on type I and type II alveolar cells in the human lungs) was found to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and it has been estimated that the binding capability of SARS-CoV-2 is 10-20 times greater compared to that of SARS-CoV 2 . The binding of ACE2 would result in protein hyper-expression responsible for alveolar damage and exert the development of pathologic systemic events. Despite the possible animal-to-human transmission previously suggested, it is now largely accepted that most cases result from human-to-human transmission by means of droplets or direct contact with a median incubation period of 3 days 3 . In addition, there is actually evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission by asymptomatic carriers 4 . While SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in patient stools and on environmental surfaces 5 , transmission by an fecal-oral route and through inanimate objects remains unclear. A supposed hospital-related transmission has been estimated to occur in more than 40% of cases 3 . In this regard, the non-negligent rate of cases detected among physicians and healthcare personnel is of particular concern 6 . Among infected healthcare workers in China, Dr. Li Wengliang was an ophthalmologist who contracted SARS-CoV-2 from an asymptomatic patient with glaucoma in early January and died one month later. In addition, Chinese state media confirmed the death of Dr. Liang Wudong, a 62-year-old ENT specialist at Hubei Xinhau Hospital in Wuhan after having treated patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Some reports suggest that transmission from patients with subclinic infection may occur by aerosol inoculation of droplets and other infected secretions into mucous membranes of the conjunctiva and the airways 7 . Clinical manifestations include fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, headache and diarrhea 3, 8 . Upper airway manifestations such as rhinorrhoea and sore throat may also occur (and reported, respectively, in about 4% and 17% of cases) 3, 8 . It may be speculated that in some cases milder features commonly described after influenza-like infections such as hyposmia, dyssomnia and hypogeusia may be present as well. Some ophthalmologists recently posed attention to the risk of cross-infection between patients and physicians during ophthalmologic evaluations 9 . On the basis of these considerations, the risk of contamination of healthcare workers seems to be particularly increased for ENT physicians for several reasons. The first is related to the fact that patients need to remove a face mask in order to undergo objective clinical assessment and that clinicians are placed in close proximity to them. In addition, some clinical maneuvers (oropharyngeal inspection, nasopharyngeal and laryngeal fibre endoscopy) elicit the dispersion of aerosol particles during cough and sneezing. Under these circumstances, the systematic resort to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, medical masks, goggles or a face shield, and gowns as recently pointed out by the WHO 10 and their correct use are points of crucial importance especially for ENT physicians. In particular, ENT specialists should specifically adhere to the equipment recommended for aerosol-generating procedures performed on SARS-CoV-2 patients during each examination: i.e. N95 or FFP2 standard or equiva-lent respirator, gown, gloves, eye protection and apron. We need to remember that the use of gloves does not replace the need for frequent and appropriate hand washing. Given the absence of specific antiviral treatments, strategies aimed at achieving epidemic control of SARS-CoV2 infection (including improving individual protection) are the only effective measures presently available. Greater awareness from healthcare personnel at increased risk of transmission, including ENT physicians, is also advisable in order to reduce the rate of cross-infection. There is an extremely urgent need for the national diffusion of these preventive strategies and adequate training of medical personnel.\n","Score: 10.348680477934847\n","\n","Title: Photodynamic Antimicrobial Polymers for Infection Control\n","Body Text: Hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections pose a global healthcare concern. It has been estimated that 1 in 10 patients will acquire an infection after admission to a healthcare institution [1] . Such infection presents a serious risk to the morbidity and mortality of the most vulnerable individuals, who are being cared for in the very environment where recuperation and improvement in health and wellbeing is intended. The financial burden to healthcare systems is also alarming; a decade ago the annual economic cost of nosocomial infection in the US was determined to be in the region of $6.7 billion [1] . The costs of implementing strategies to prevent nosocomial infection is likely much less than the value of resources consumed in treatment of these infections once they occur [2] . A major concern in the treatment of nosocomial infection is the emergence of bacterial pathogens displaying resistance to a broad range of antibacterial chemotherapeutic drugs [3] . While the discovery of antibiotics has proved one of the most important advances in healthcare in the 20 th century, their widespread use is a double-edged sword. There has been a profound effect on the selective adaptation of bacteria, with multi-drug resistant strains (MDR) emerging at an alarming rate, and threatening the end of the ''antibiotic era'' [4, 5] . Antibiotic resistant bacteria pose a serious problem in hospitals; strains of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) appear well adapted to the healthcare environment and have spread internationally (epidemic MRSA, EMRSA) [6] . With the discovery of the next generation of new and efficacious antibiotics lagging behind the emergence of MDR bacteria, the importance of hygiene and disinfection practices in healthcare institutions requires particular emphasis; such interventions may prevent cross-colonization of patients due to contamination of inanimate objects, such as handrails, bedding and medical equipment, or even the skin of healthcare workers and patients, acting as a reservoir for nosocomial infection [7] . In addition to MRSA, there is evidence to suggest that other pathogens may be transmitted by means of environmental reservoirs, including viral pathogens (influenza virus, norovirus, hepatitis, coronavirus), and problematic Gram-negative pathogens (Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant enterococci) [7] . The present mainstay employed in controlling hospital infection is cleansing using biocides (antiseptics and disinfectants), such as quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), halogen-releasing agents, and phenolics. The activity of such biocide agents depends on several factors, most notably concentration, period of contact, pH, temperature, numbers and nature of microorganisms to be inactivated [8] . There is also concern that intensive exposure of nosocomial pathogens to biocides may allow for the selection of biocide resistant/tolerant bacterial strains [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Unlike antibiotics that act at a specific cellular target or interfere with a defined metabolic process, biocides act in a non-specific manner at a variety of cellular targets, such as the bacterial outer membrane or cell wall, the cytoplasmic membrane, proteins, genetic material, and other cytosolic components [13] . Despite this, MRSA strains that show resistance to antiseptics and disinfectants have been isolated from clinical samples, with resistance due to the presence of genes encoding for energy-dependent drug efflux mechanisms, and these genes also confer cross-resistance to a diverse range of antimicrobial drugs [10] . In addition to acquired genetic resistance, bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth are inherently tolerant to inactivation using biocides [14] . Bacterial biofilms are defined as a sessile community of bacteria, characterized by cells that are irreversibly attached to a substratum or interface, or to each other, and are imbedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that they have produced, and exhibit an altered phenotype with respect to growth rate and gene transcription [15] . The biofilm provides an environment where antimicrobial penetration is hindered, genetic exchange and resistance transfer are facilitated, and a change in physiological state, such as stationary phase dormant zones, are a significant factor in the resistance to antibacterial challenge [16, 17] . Numerous studies have demonstrated the difficulties in biofilm eradication using biocides commonly employed for cleansing purposes in the hospital setting [18] [19] [20] [21] . There is therefore a logical interest in the development of antibacterial surfaces, serving to reduce microbial bioburden on these materials. By preventing the interaction with and adherence of bacterial cells to a surface, the initial stages of biofilm formation are disrupted, effectively removing the foundation which the bacterial biofilm requires. Antimicrobial polymeric coatings, fabrics, and paints are examples of approaches that have attracted interest to date [22] [23] [24] .\n"," This current study investigates the use of photosensitizer incorporation into polymers, with this approach intended to impart an antimicrobial and/or anti-adherent property to the material surface. Photosensitizers such as porphyrins and phenothiazines have been used clinically in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of malignancies [25] [26] [27] , and have potential application in photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT), with photodynamic inactivation of MDR bacteria proving equally as effective as antibiotic-susceptible strains [28] [29] [30] [31] . The mechanism of action of photodynamic therapy relies on the fact that photosensitizers are capable of reacting in the presence of visible light to produce cytotoxic effects. Phototoxic effects are initiated when, on absorption of an appropriate wavelength of light, the photosensitizer molecule is excited to the higher energy triplet state. This energy can be dissipated in one of two ways, via electron-transfer from the photosensitizer to a substrate, producing radical ions, which can react with oxygen, forming cytotoxic molecules such as superoxide, hydroxyl and lipid-derived radicals, or via direct energy transfer to oxygen, to produce the higher energy state singlet oxygen, which is highly reactive and can oxidize biological molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, resulting in cytotoxicity [29, 31, 33] .\n"," Previously, we demonstrated how incorporation of photosensitizers into hydrogels can generate singlet oxygen on a biomaterial surface, with intended application in the design of infectionresistant medical devices [34, 35, 37] . Here, we generalise this concept, and demonstrate the facile production of a model twolayer poly(ethylene) (PE) film system, with one layer comprising sensitizer-incorporated PE, and the other a backing layer with the mechanical properties desired for the end application. Such a photodynamic, infection-resistant material may find broad application as coatings or covers for various inanimate objects commonly found in a hospital environment such as handrails, high-tech medical equipment (in particular touch-screens of IT devices), or materials for the manufacture of difficult-to-clean polymer surfaces such as coiled telephone cables or keypads. Incorporation of photosensitizer into PE by a hot-melt extrusion process, mechanical performance of sensitizer-incorporated polymer, leaching behaviour of sensitizer from the material, and antimicrobial properties of the material against a methicillin resistant strain of S. aureus and the Gram negative pathogen, Escherichia coli, upon light illumination are detailed. The results illustrate the viability of such materials as an effective general means for creating antimicrobial surfaces with the potential to control the spread of bacterial pathogens.\n"," High-density poly(ethylene) (HDPE) was obtained from Q-Chem Ltd, Doha, Qatar (Marlex HHM TR-144, BN. 11100464). Low-denisty poly(ethylene) (LDPE) was obtained from Lydonell-BAsel Industries, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Photosensitizers, cationic 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridinio)porphyrin tetra(p-toluenesulfonate) .97% (TMPyP) was obtained from Tri-PorTech GmbH, Lübeck, Germany. Neutral 5,10,15,20-Tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine 97% (TPP), Toluidine blue O (Tolonium chloride) 97% (TBO), and Methylene blue $82% (MB) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK, and were used without further purification.\n"," Extrusion was performed using a Dr Collin ZK 25 co-rotating twin screw extruder, with paired general purpose screws containing mixing section (25 mm dia; L/D ratio 36), and equipped with Dr Collin 250 mm slot die (coat hanger formation). Extrusion was controlled via a Dr Collin ECS-30 system and sheets were collected using a Dr Collin CR 136-350 chill-roll unit with three roll stack. Extruded materials were prepared in 1 kg batches containing pure PE or mixtures of either TMPyP, TPP, TBO, or MB and HDPE at sensitizer concentrations of 0.05% (0.50 g) and 0.40% (4.00 g) (w/w). The required weights of HDPE and sensitizer were mixed together until a consistent and even coating of HDPE with sensitizer was achieved. The extruder was preheated to 230uC along the screw and at the die. Pure HDPE was extruded initially in order to ensure the correct conditions had been obtained. Melt temperature was set at 222uC, screw speed at 60 rpm and pressure at the die was measured to be 114 bar. The chill roll was maintained at 110uC and roller speed was 1.2 metres per minute. Once a film of consistent quality and thickness was obtained, the hopper was emptied of remaining PE and was filled with the required sensitizer-containing PE mixture. Initial extrudate was discarded due to uneven mixing, resulting from the extrusion of the remainder of the pure PE resident in the screw, with collection beginning once pigmentation was uniform. Similarly, extrudate at the end of the batch was discarded as reduction in the available mass of the mixture resulted in reduced pressure, affecting the homogeneity of the film. The residence time of the sensitizer-PE mixture within the extruder was approximately 5 minutes.\n"," Platen pressing was achieved using a Dr Collin P 200 P platen press, capable of maintaining a maximum temperature of 300uC and maximum pressure of 250 bar, with an effective operating area of 1966196 mm 2 . Sections of extruded sheets, one pure HDPE and a second sensitizer-incorporated HDPE, were cut to approximately 1906190 mm 2 and placed one on top of the other inside a PTFE envelope. The envelope was placed on a tray and set in the platen press, pre-heated to 150uC, after which a five stage automated program was initiated, with temperature and pressure not exceeding 150uC and 70 bar respectively.\n"," Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Leica DM RE upright microscope in conjunction with a Leica TCS SP2 system, and images were analyzed using Leica LAS AF imaging software. All images captured were 204862048 pixels, with a line average of 16 and were the average of 16 individual scans. The microscope pinhole was set at a 5.89 airy (600 mm) diameter. Reflectance images were recorded by setting the excitation beam wavelength to 488 nm and detecting emission in the range 480-500 nm. Fluorescence images required setting a suitable excitation wavelength and emission detection dependent on the photosensitizer under examination. For TPP, wavelengths used were 514 nm (excitation) and 600 nm -800 nm (emission), and for TMPyP wavelengths used were 514 nm (excitation) and 600 nm -720 nm (emission), while the emission wavelengths of MB and TBO lay outside the detection range of our instrumentation. Optical microscopy was therefore used to examine the distribution and homogeneity of MB and TBO within the polymer.\n"," As a possible end application of these materials is antimicrobial covers for touch-screen devices, it is important to determine the transparency and optical clarity of the photosensitizer-incorporated films. UV-visible spectroscopy was performed using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 650 UV-visible spectrophotometer, to determine the optical transmittance of the materials in the visible region between 390-750 nm. This was achieved by attaching samples to the wall of a quartz cuvette, scanning this region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and determining mean transmission across this range of wavelengths. This analysis is used to determine the percentage of visible light that is transmitted through the photosensitizer-incorporated materials. Mechanical analysis of films was performed on dumb-bell shaped samples (length 30 mm, thickness of narrow portion 2 mm) cut using a Ray-Ran hand-operated cutting press, and was tested using a Stable Micro Systems TA.XT plus texture analyzer, fitted with a 40 kg load cell. The dimensions of the narrow portion of the dumb-bell (width and thickness) were measured using a digital micrometer, and the samples were secured between the mobile upper and static lower clamps of the texture analyzer. The distance separating the upper and lower clamps was used to measure the gauge length of the sample. In order to test the sample, the upper clamp was raised at a speed of 50 mm.min 21 , until sample fracture occurred. From the resultant stress-strain relationship, the mechanical properties of the samples (yield point, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), Young's modulus and percentage elongation) were calculated. A minimum of five replicates of each sample were performed and the effect of incorporation of varying concentrations of both photosensitizers on the mechanical properties of PE was assessed for statistical significance using a one-way ANOVA, with post-hoc comparisons made using Tukey's HSD test. Significance was denoted by a value of p,0.05.\n"," Photosensitizer-incorporated samples (30620 mm) were cut and pressed firmly 1000 times with one clean, washed finger.\n"," Adherent photosensitizer was washed from the finger by immersing in 10 mL deionised water for 30 seconds. Solutions were analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 650 UV-visible spectrophotometer; the concentration of photosensitizer in solution was determined via the calculated molar extinction coefficient, (e) at l max , of solutions of known concentrations. Calculated e values are as follows: TBO 39,750 mol 21 dm 23 cm 21 (l max 610 nm); TPP 406,750 mol 21 dm 23 cm 21 (l max 420 nm); MB 74,028 mol 21 dm 23 cm 21 (l max 664 nm); TMPyP 193,000 mol 21 dm 23 cm 21 (l max 446 nm). Using the same sample, the materials were pressed a further 1000 times, repeating the procedure as before, and continuing to touch samples in increments of 1000, up to 10,000 times. Analyses were carried out in triplicate.\n"," Photosensitizer-incorporated samples (75650 mm) were cut and wiped 50 times with a medical wipe moistened in a 1% (w/ v) solution of non-ionic surfactant, Tween 20, as a model for typical hospital surface cleaning products. Leaching of the highlycolored photosensitizer by this surface cleansing procedure was assessed by examination of the degree of staining of the medical wipe. Using the same sample, the materials were wiped a further 50 times, repeating the procedure as before, and continuing to clean samples in increments of 50, up to 500 times. Analyses were repeated in triplicate. \n"," Bacterial adherence to materials was tested using methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC 33591; bacteria were grown aerobically at 37uC in Müller-Hinton Broth (MHB) for 18 hours. During log phase of growth, the broth culture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 12 minutes, the cell pellet resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The suspension was diluted, such that the optical density was 0.3 at 540 nm (approx. 2.0610 8 cfu/mL). The suspension was serially diluted in PBS, to form the final inoculum (approx. 4.0610 5 cfu/mL). Sensitizerloaded samples and controls (blank HDPE without sensitizer) were cut to 15610 mm. Drops of bacterial inoculum (60 mL -approx. 1.6610 4 cfu/cm 2 ) were placed into a sterile petri dish, after which each drop was covered with a single sensitizer-loaded or control sample. Petri dishes containing inoculated samples were inverted, in order to facilitate light irradiation of the polymer surface in contact with the bacteria, and placed under two 230W halogen bulbs situated 24 cm from dishes, providing 1340 mW light across the sample surface, for 2 hours. Samples are held in place against the base of the inverted petri dish by adhesive capillary force.\n"," Post-illumination, samples were removed from petri dishes and placed in 10 mL PBS, inverting constantly for 30 seconds, to remove non-adherent bacteria; samples were then transferred to individual bijoux bottles containing 2 mL Quarter Strength Ringers Solution (QSRS). Samples were sonicated for 10 minutes in order to remove and suspend adherent bacteria, using a Branson 3510 ultrasonic cleaner providing a fixed puissance of 42 KHz. The number of surviving microorganisms were determined by spread plating on Müller-Hinton Agar (MHA) plates. Plates were allowed to dry, inverted and incubated at 37uC, 50% RH for 18-24 hours. Testing was performed using five replicates of each sensitizer-loaded material (at both high and low concentrations), along with corresponding polyethylene control. Lead materials identified as effective against MRSA were then carried forward for further testing with Gram-negative Escherichia coli NCTC 8196. These lead materials (MB 0.4%, TBO 0.4%, and TMPyP 0.4%) were tested against E. coli as per methodology described above. Statistical significance was determined against dark HDPE control and was carried out using a two-tailed student's t-test, p,0.05.\n"," Distribution of sensitizer in materials and optical transmittance of sensitizer incorporated films HDPE sheets containing varying concentrations of sensitizers were subject to examination by confocal laser microscopy. Samples were first viewed in reflectance mode, in order to provide images of the material surfaces. No distinct visual alterations to the polymer surface were seen upon addition of TPP to the HDPE mixture, however, inspection of TMPyP incorporated HDPE appears to show some aggregates at the material surface; there also appears to be some modification to the polymer surface upon addition of the higher concentrations of MB and TBO, likely due to the presence of aggregates at the material surface, compared with the relatively smooth surface of the pure HDPE, as illustrated in Figure 1 .\n"," The use of fluorescence imaging allowed visualization of the sensitizer throughout the materials. At both 0.40% and 0.05% TPP loading, an even fluorescence signal was observed on the surfaces of the samples, indication that the photosensitizer has been well mixed with the polymer and has produced a largely homogenous surface, as displayed in Figure 2 . However, fluorescence imaging of the surface of TMPyP incorporated HDPE revealed incomplete mixing of the photosensitizer with the material, at both the 0.05% and 0.40% concentrations ( Figure 2) .\n"," As fluorescence imaging of materials containing TBO and MB was not possible, optical microscope images were collected and revealed a relatively even colouring with minimal alteration in the surface compared to HDPE; however, the images show small UV-visible spectroscopic analysis of photosensitizer-loaded samples was performed to determine the transmittance of light through the sample, in order to give a measure of optical clarity and transparency. The mean transmittance of pure polyethylene film, across the visible range (390 nm-750 nm), was 68%. Compared with this, the transmittance of low concentration porphyrin-incorporated materials (0.05% TPP and TMPyP) was approximately 49%, in both cases. Samples containing 0.4% TMPyP exhibited transmittance of 37%, while 0.4% TPP reduced transmittance to 33%. For phenothiazine incorporated films, the transmittance of low concentration materials (0.05% TBO and MB) was approximately 46% and 44%, respectively. Samples containing 0.40% MB exhibited transmittance of 28%, while 0.40% TBO reduced transmittance to 14%.\n"," Mechanical testing of prepared HDPE samples, containing either TPP, TMPyP, MB or TBO at concentrations of 0.05 or 0.40% (w/w), was performed and the results compared to the mechanical properties of pure HDPE. Using the data collected, four measures of the mechanical performance of the materials were calculated -yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), Young's Modulus, and percentage elongation, which are shown in Figure 4 (porphyrin-based sensitizers, TPP and TMPyP) and while, although not significant, 0.40% TBO also reduced tensile strength (48.663.73 (0.05%) and 51.063.9 (0.40%)).\n"," Addition of TPP produces no significant change in the Young's modulus from that of PE (665645 MPa (PE) vs. 619610 (0.05%) and 637642 (0.40%)); however inclusion of 0.05% TMPyP in PE sheets results in significant reduction in Young's modulus (576613 MPa), indicating increased elasticity and reduced stiffness of these samples. Higher concentrations of TMPyP (0.40%) produce no significant change compared with PE (611621 MPa). Addition of 0.05% TBO produces significant alteration of the Young's modulus of PE (808634 MPa vs. 641660); addition of 0.40% TBO also results in significant reduction (695653 MPa), however the reduction observed is not as great and suggests that on increasing TBO loading further, materials may return to similar levels to that of PE. Inclusion of MB in PE sheets results in a similar pattern to that of TBO, however reductions in Young's moduli (731675 MPa (0.05%) and 772695 (0.40%)) are not considered statistically significant. It should be noted that standard deviation of Young's moduli of photosensitizer-incorporated PE samples are greater than that observed for PE suggesting that inclusion of photosensitizers has resulted in greater variability with regard to this mechanical property.\n"," Use of TPP, initially, produces moderate, but statistically insignificant, increase in elongation from that of PE (7516120% vs. 885651 (0.05%)); however increasing concentration to 0.40% significantly increases elongation (901672%). Similarly, 0.05% TMPyP results in no significant changes in elongation (816646%); however at concentrations of 0.40%, TMPyP significantly reduces the percentage elongation of the sample (548646%). Use of TBO produces significant increases in elongation, with increasing concentration, from that of PE (563648% vs. 756642 (0.05%) and 840647% (0.40%)). Similarly, MB inclusion also results in significant increases in elongation (684668% (0.05%) and 728694% (0.40%)).\n"," Touch testing was performed on samples containing TPP, TMPyP, TBO, and MB, all at a concentration of 0.4%. It was observed that after 10,000 touches of the TMPyP, MB and TBO samples, no photosensitizer had leached from the material. A small amount of leaching was observed from TPP-loaded HDPE, equating to 0.0045% of the total TPP in the sample tested.\n"," Leaching of photosensitizer from the material during surface cleansing was assessed by wiping the material surface with a medical wipe moistened in 1% (w/v) Tween 20. Slight staining of the medical wipe was evident in the case of TMPyP, TPP and MB, although the amount could not be quantified due to the difficulty in extracting the photosensitizer from the wipe into solution for UV-visible spectroscopic analysis. For TBO surface cleansing did not result in the staining of the medical wipe, indicating that for this photosensitizer, leaching was negligible or failed to occur.\n"," The experimental design used in these leaching tests reflects the environment the materials would experience in their intended end application. These results indicate that negligible leaching would occur during normal skin contact or wipe cleaning with detergent.\n"," Antimicrobial adherence was performed by inoculating samples with MRSA and E.coli and determining the number of viable bacteria after two hours, in either light or dark conditions. Only lead materials that demonstrated good antibacterial activity against Gram-positive MRSA were taken forward to testing against Gram-negative E.coli. Gram-negative bacteria are widely considered to be more tolerant to photoinactivation than their Gram-positive counterparts [29, 36] . Reduction in bacterial adherence on light irradiation, when compared to identical material samples inoculated in the dark, and additional controls of non-photosensitizer incorporated materials in both light and dark conditions, are shown in Figures 6 and 7 . Figure 6 illustrates the results obtained against MRSA. It is clear that the greatest log-cycle reduction in colony-forming units (CFU) per square centimetre material are observed for those samples containing the higher (0.4%) concentration of photosensitizer. HDPE containing TPP 0.4% displayed the least antimicrobial activity, with a 0.40 log-cycle reduction in MRSA adherence when compared to dark HDPE control. MB 0.4%, TBO 0.4% and TMPyP 0.4% showed a 1.39, 2.30, and 3.62 logcycle reduction against MRSA adherence respectively.\n"," As shown in Figure 7 , E.coli were inherently less adherent than MRSA on all materials, including the HDPE controls without photosensitizer. HDPE containing 0.4% TMPyP displayed excellent anti-bacterial and anti-adherent characteristics, with no viable organisms detected after light irradiation, equating to a 1.51 logcycle reduction in adhered E.coli, when compared to HDPE dark control. MB 0.4% and TBO 0.4% did not perform as favourably, resulting in a 0.75, and a 0.47 log-cycle reduction in adherence, respectively.\n"," Several photosensitizing compounds, namely TMPyP, TPP (phorphyrin-based), TBO and MB (phenothiazine dyes), were successfully incorporated into high density poly(ethylene) (HDPE) films by a hot-melt extrusion process, and incorporated into a twin-layer polymer sheet by platen press. Our aim is to develop photodynamic antimicrobial surfaces that may be used in a healthcare environment to prevent the spread of nosocomial infection. The antimicrobial surface is the result of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to illumination of photosensitizer molecules present in the polymer film, as demonstrated by our earlier work on related materials [28] . These ROS react indiscriminately with components of the bacterial cell, such as nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, eventually causing cell death [29, [31] [32] [33] .\n"," The hot-melt extrusion process was successful in incorporating photosensitizer into HDPE films, although the homogeneity of photosensitizer distribution within the film appears to vary depending on the photosensitizer used. CLSM fluorescence microscopy revealed favourable homogenous distribution of TPP within the extruded polymer, and this is likely due to the neutral hydrophobic properties of TPP allowing for complete miscibility with the poly(ethylene). The other sensitizers used, TMPyP, TBO and MB, all show some evidence of photosensitizer aggregation and incomplete mixing, with the phenothiazines TBO and MB to a lesser extent than TMPyP. It is desirable to maintain a smooth material surface, as an increase is surface roughness or irregularity may promote adhesion of bacteria. Figure 1 shows that at the higher photosensitizer concentrations employed (0.40%), a smooth, regular surface was maintained in films incorporating the porphyrin-based TPP and TMPyP while TBO and MB did display evidence of surface modification, however the effects of this on the ability of bacteria to adhere to the material surface will only be evident through microbiological testing.\n"," Characterization of mechanical properties of the prepared films by determination of yield point, ultimate tensile strength, Young's modulus and percentage elongation measurements reveal that incorporation of TPP and TMPyP have a minimal effect on the mechanical characteristics of the HDPE films, while incorporation of TBO or MB have a slight negative effect, suggesting that these sensitizers may adversely effect the quality of the material. However, if TBO or MB were incorporated into the twin layer system as the minor layer, the overall effect is likely negligible.\n"," UV-visible spectroscopy demonstrated that incorporation of photosensitizer into the HDPE films has a negative effect on the optical clarity of the materials given that mean transmission over the visible range (390 nm -750 nm) is reduced in comparison to control HDPE, especially at the higher concentration of photosensitizer used. The implications of this observation depend on the intended purpose of the material. For example, a cover for a touch-screen computer would require the material to have good optical transmittance. It should be noted, however, that in this study the thickness of the photosensitizer-incorporated material is approximately 200 mm and with a different manufacturing process, such as blown-film extrusion, this may be reduced to 25 mm, and hence it is expected that optical transmittance of the photosensitizer incorporated films would improve dramatically. The study of leaching behaviour from materials via touchtesting shows that TMPyP, TBO and MB are not removed from the material surface by this mechanism, while minimal amounts of TPP are lost after 10,000 touches. This favourable leaching behaviour is important should these materials be used as covers for equipment such as touch-screen covers, keypads or handrails.\n"," Antimicrobial testing showed that the most effective photosensitizer for incorporating into antimicrobial HDPE films was TMPyP at the high concentration of 0.40%. This material displayed a 3.61 log-cycle reduction in viable MRSA, and 1.51 log-cycle reduction in E. coli after two hours light irradiation at 1340 mW/cm 2 per sample, using halogen bulbs as a light source. The ability of the TMPyP-incorporated HDPE in achieving a greater than one log-cycle reduction of a Gram-negative bacterium is encouraging, since the Gram-negative outer membrane functions as a barrier, protecting the cell and rendering it more resilient to photodynamic inactivation. It is the polycationic nature of the TMPyP molecule that imparts an advantage over the neutral TPP photosensitizer, as the cation is necessary for interaction and disruption of the outer membrane, so making inactivation with ROS possible [36] .\n"," The white light generated by the halogen bulb light source is inexpensive and representative of lighting conditions found in typical artificially-illuminated indoor environments, meaning that photosensitizer incorporated materials would not require any special conditions under which to produce their antimicrobial effect, as long as the environment in which they are used is adequately illuminated. Alternatively, for specific decontamination purposes, such as during deep-cleaning of hospital operating theatres, specialized lighting could be installed to emit at higher intensity, and at a wavelength specific for the excitation of the photosensitizer employed, for efficient generation of ROS and the resulting bactericidal effects.\n"," This study, aimed at controlling the microbial bioburden and infectious reservoir on inanimate, everyday objects, builds upon our previous work in the development of photo-activated, antimicrobial polymers for the prevention of medical device associated infection [34, 35, 37] , thereby expanding scope of photoactive materials for potential infection control applications in a healthcare setting. Other published studies have documented the incorporation of photosensitizing compounds into various materials with the aim of generating anti-microbial or anti-infective surfaces. For example, Krouit et. al. (2008) incorporated a cationic porphyrin into a cellulose-based material [38] . However, the microbiological assays used in their work make it difficult to conclude if the reduction in viable bacteria was due to contact of sessile bacteria with the material surface, or release and diffusion of porphyrin into the nutrient agar used, in a similar fashion to antibiotic testing 'zone of inhibition' assays. Conversely the methodology used in our present study is specific against assessing the photo-inactivation of sessile, surface immobilised, adherent bacteria.\n"," Our photosensitizer incorporated HDPE films display similar antibacterial efficacy as a photoactive cotton fabric, developed by Ringot et. al. (2011) . This group also demonstrated the inherent difficulty of photo-inactivation of Gram-negative species in comparison to Gram-positive. The cotton-based fabrics documented in their study showed up to 5 log-cycle reductions in viable S. aureus, but only an approximate 1 log-cycle reduction in E.coli [39] . These figures are comparable to those we have obtained in our present work.\n"," While we have focused on the antibacterial activity of our developed materials, future work shall investigate their ability to resist colonization with other pathogens, such as yeasts. Alvarez et. al. (2012) have reported successful inactivation of Candida albicans using polysilsesquioxane films doped with porphyrin [40] .\n"," This study demonstrates a general method to manufacture lightactivated antimicrobial surfaces through the incorporation of photosensitizers into polymer films, specifically exemplified using high density poly(ethylene) showing high levels of antimicrobial behaviour, even to resistant strains such as MRSA and Gramnegative organisms in the presence of visible light. The use of such materials in the healthcare setting as coatings or coverings of inanimate objects such as keypads, touchscreens or handrails, may remove these surfaces as reservoirs of nosocomial pathogens. This may assist in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections, which are currently detrimental to the morbidity and mortality of vulnerable patients, and also have a significant financial impact on the resources of modern healthcare systems and institutions.\n","Score: 10.05602804095144\n","\n","Title: \n","Body Text: S of July 10, 2003, 438 cases (250 probable, 188 suspect) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were reported in Canada, 375 (85.3%) of which occurred in Ontario. 1 The majority of cases in Ontario occurred in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). SARS has resulted in unprecedented apprehension in the local community and severe economic harm to local business and tourism. More importantly, it has challenged health care workers to use effective infection control measures. In the present article, we will discuss the infection control guidelines for the anesthesiologist that were adopted by our institution, the rationale behind them and the impact of the SARS outbreak on anesthesiologists in Toronto.\n"," illness was called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) with a case definition (Table I) from the World Health Organization (WHO). 3 On March 12, 2003 , WHO issued a global alert in relation to clusters of SARS. 4 In Toronto, the first documented case was a 78-yr-old woman who had travelled to Hong Kong on February 13 with her husband. 5 In Hong Kong, she and her husband stayed at a hotel at the same time and on the same floor as the Guangdong physician from whom the outbreak in Hong Kong originated. On returning to Toronto on February 23, she stayed in her apartment, which she shared with family members. Two days later, she became ill and died at home on March 5, 2003 . Several of the family subsequently developed respiratory symptoms. The 43-yr-old son was admitted to the emergency department of a community hospital in Scarborough that became the epicentre of the Toronto outbreak. By the end of April, 262 SARS cases (143 probable, 119 suspected) and 21 deaths had been reported in Ontario, the majority in the GTA. 6 All these cases could be traced back to the original index patient. On April 23, WHO issued a travel advisory warning for Toronto, which was removed one week later. On May 14, Toronto was removed from the list of areas affected by SARS as no new probable case had been reported since April 19. However, another cluster of SARS patients was discovered on May 23, 2003. 7 The second cluster was traced to a 96-yr-old man who underwent surgery for a fractured pelvis in a hospital in North York on April 19. While in hospital he developed SARS but it was managed as postoperative pneumonia. He infected several other patients in his ward, including a woman who was later transferred to a rehabilitation hospital. This resulted in a further 118 cases in the GTA as of July 10, 2003. 1 Eventually, on July 2, WHO removed Toronto from the list of areas with recent local transmissions.\n"," R Re e--e ex xa am mi in na at ti io on n o of f i in nf fe ec ct ti io on n c co on nt tr ro ol l m me ea as su ur re es s The SARS outbreak is unique in recent history of public health because of its rapidity of transmission, its concentration in health care settings and the large number of health care workers who were infected. In an analysis of a cohort of 144 patients with SARS in the GTA, 73 (51%) were health care workers, 8 including 14 (19%) physicians and 29 (40%) nurses. Anesthesiologists, as specialists in airway management, are at high risk because of frequent exposure to patients' respiratory secretions. Three anesthesiologists in our area were infected. 9 They contracted the disease after tracheal intubation of patients with respi- -high fever (> 38°C) AND -cough or breathing difficulty AND one or more of the following exposures during the ten days prior to onset of symptoms:\n"," -close contact B with a person who is a suspect or probable case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); -history of travel to an area with recent local transmission of SARS -residing in an area with recent local transmission of SARS 2 A person with an unexplained acute respiratory illness resulting in death after 1 November 2002, A but on whom no autopsy has been performed AND one or more of the following exposures during to ten days prior to onset of symptoms:\n"," -close contact, B with a person who is a suspect or probable case of SARS; -history of travel to an area with recent local transmission of SARS -residing in an area with recent local transmission of SARS Probable case 1 A suspect case with radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) on chest\n"," x-ray (CXR). 2 A suspect case of SARS that is positive for SARS coronavirus by one or more assays. 3 A suspect case with autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of RDS without an identifiable cause. ratory failure of unknown cause. These cases occurred in the early stage of the outbreak before SARS was suspected. The anesthesiologists wore surgical facemasks, gowns and gloves but no goggles/visors.\n"," International investigations have revealed important information that prompted health care workers to reexamine the precautionary measures for infection control.\n"," The agent that causes SARS is a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV), unlike any other human or animal virus in the Coronavirus family. 10, 11 The virus can survive for up to 48 hr after drying on plastic surfaces. 12 In Hong Kong the virus survived in urine and feces for at least 24 and 48 hr respectively. In patients with diarrhea, the virus can survive up to four days in the stool sample which has a lower acidity than normal stools. 12 Thus, once the body is exposed to this viral agent, the body surface can be contaminated for an extended time. Similarly, exposed inanimate objects may act as carriers for up to 48 hr.\n"," The virus is spread predominately by infectious droplets and contact. Because of early reports of clusters of cases in community settings such as apartment buildings and the high infection rates among health care workers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Hanoi and Toronto, the etiological agent of SARS was thought to be highly contagious. 13, 14 However, with the exception of 'superspreaders', there is growing evidence that SARS-CoV is only moderately transmissible. 15, 16 The average number of secondary infections generated per case at the start of the epidemic was estimated as 2.7, which is much lower than that for influenza. 17 In some instances, however, a single individual (\"superspreader\") has directly infected a large number of other people. This is exemplified by the Singapore outbreak in which half of the first reported 201 probable cases were infected by five source cases. 18 Despite the discovery of the virus and its genome, it is still uncertain when patients are most infectious and how to identify 'superspreaders'. 19 \n"," In Hong Kong and Toronto, most of the patients infected with SARS had no co-morbid illnesses and half of them (44-51%) were fit health care workers. 8, 20 Approximately one in five (20-23%) patients with SARS required admission to intensive care units (ICU) with or without ventilatory support.\n"," In a detailed analysis of cases identified in the initial outbreak associated with the nosocomial transmission of SARS in the index hospital in Toronto, the case fatality rates were 2.9% and 53.8% for those aged less than or over 60 yr respectively. 1 The case-fatality rate was calculated by dividing the cumulative number of deaths within 60 days after symptom onset by the total number of probable and suspect cases. Data from the WHO 21 revealed that the overall case fatality ratio was 14 to 15% and was influenced by age (Table II) . This ratio was estimated by survival analysis based on the individual data from the onset of the illness until death or full recovery.\n"," Early in the Toronto SARS outbreak, full protective gear (goggles, gowns, N95 masks and gloves) was considered to be sufficient to protect health care workers from SARS. In April, a number of health care workers contracted the infection during their care of SARS patients despite increased protective precautions. 22, 23 Experience from Hong Kong suggested that the infection among 'protected' health care worker was related to how well the precautionary measures were used. In a case-control survey, 24 they found no infection in staff using complete precautionary measures, whereas infected staff had omitted at least one of the precautionary measures. This demonstrates how difficult it is to practice and perfect full infection control in view of the long survival ability of the virus outside the body. Additional measures have been suggested. However, most important of all is the 'hypervigilance' of health care workers in practicing infection control measure.\n"," I In nf fe ec ct ti io on n c co on nt tr ro ol l g gu ui id de el li in ne es s f fo or r a an ne es st th he es si ia a Exposure to oral and respiratory secretions at the time of tracheal intubation subjects the anesthesiologist to a serious risk of acquiring the infection. Health organizations and agencies such as WHO, 25 This guideline applies to all surgical patients and is based on long-standing recommendations by Health Canada that masks and eye protection or face shields should be worn where appropriate to protect the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth during procedures and patient care activities likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions. 29 For practical purposes, the anesthetic machine is considered 'dirty' and the anesthetic drug cart as 'clean'. The machine is usually the first area anesthesiologists touch after contact with the patient. A large container is positioned on the anesthesia machine in which all airway equipment (laryngoscope blade and handle, mask, suction catheter, etc.) is placed after use. The container and its contents are removed from the OR as soon as possible following intubation. The contents are separated for cleaning, sterilization or disposal before they are returned to the OR. A second set of equipment including clean masks, laryngoscope handles and blades is immediately available. All steps are taken to keep the anesthesia drug cart 'clean'. The cart is used only after hand-washing or removal of the outer pair of gloves. Thus, the infection control team should be informed about the transfer route. The spread of respiratory droplets from the infected patient should be minimized by the patient wearing a N95 mask without an expiratory valve. Staff involved in the transfer and the care of patients in the OR should take full droplet/contact precautions. Clean surgical scrub suits laundered by the hospital should be worn and personalized hats or hair covers are avoided. The rationale for using alcohol-based hand rub, N95 masks, gowns, gloves and powered respirators in the OR has been reviewed recently. 9 Because the SARS-CoV virus is spread by droplets and can survive on inanimate objects for 48 hr, extra precautions and vigilance are important to avoid contaminating anesthesia equipment or surfaces such as the telephone in the OR. Double gloves are recommended when handling SARS patients. The outer pair is removed after direct patient contact and before touching equipment or furniture in other areas of the room.\n"," Of the precautions recommended above, the use of personal protection systems (PPS) may be the most unfamiliar for anesthesiologists. Although it is not currently recommended by Health Canada, 27 hospitals in Ontario are using PPS according to the directive from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of Ontario to all Ontario Acute Care Hospitals for high-risk procedures. 28 The PPS adopted in our institution is the powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR 3M, Berkshire, UK) system while other hospitals have purchased the Stryker® T4 (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) PPS. No consensus has been reached regarding which has the better air filtration system. Nonetheless, these systems are considered to be important barriers to protect health care workers during high-risk procedures such as intubation and extubation. The PAPR consists of a beltmounted powered air purifier with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, connected via a tube to a lightweight headpiece (Figures 1 and 2) . The HEPA filter removes particles of 0.3 to 15 µ with an efficiency of 98 to 100%. 30 The lightweight hood or headpiece provides excellent coverage of the head, face and neck. We have several years experience in using the PAPR system in the bronchoscopy suite without disease transmission to health-care workers. There are several important clinical points to remember. First, it takes time, training and assistance to put on the personal protective equipment and the PAPR system properly. Advance warning of a patient in need of tracheal intubation is required in order to prepare properly. Second, the personal protective equipment must be removed in proper sequence to avoid contamination of the users. Third, it is difficult to communicate with each other due to the noise generat-ed by the high flow through the PAPR system. This noisy environment may cause errors due to its potential for miscommunication.\n"," Contaminated protective gear must be removed before transferring the patient to the recovery room. Time should be allowed for the anesthesiologist and assistant to remove contaminated gloves, gowns, face shields or masks and head cover and renew protective precautions at the end of the case.\n"," The anesthesia machine is protected with high efficiency, low volume filters placed in both the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the circuit. Hydrophobic filters are used in our institution as the filtering process is based on pore size and not on hydrostatic charge. The hygroscopic filter based on hydrostatic charge may become overwhelmed when wet and will allow passage of virus. With the filter placed in both limbs of the circuit, the soda lime does not need to be changed but the end-tidal CO 2 sample line and trap must be changed after the case.\n"," Most ORs currently use positive pressure with up to 20 room air exchanges per hour. Because of the high air exchanges in the OR, aerosolized infectious particles will be cleared rapidly. However, those in close contact during a high-risk procedure such as tracheal intubation/extubation may still have a high exposure, and those outside the room may be exposed to infectious aerosols if the door to the OR is left open. Therefore, movement in and out of the OR must be kept to a minimum during the procedure.\n"," Local experience from personnel who contracted SARS during airway instrumentation suggested that patient coughing should be kept at a minimum before, during and after intubation and/or induction of anesthesia. Instrumentation of the airway with either a cuffed endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway is acceptable and should be performed by the most experienced staff available.\n"," Despite the long list of precautions suggested by our institutional guidelines, it is difficult to list details of all the modifications to practice that have occurred. Questions concerning best practice remain. For example: should the pager be clipped on the OR uniform inside the OR? Should we use tape from the roll to secure the endotracheal tube or should the tape be precut? Anesthesiologists are familiar with the importance of vigilance in maintaining patient safety. A similar high level of vigilance is necessary to prevent the spread of this serious infection.\n"," In the second month of the outbreak, a cluster of six health care workers contracted SARS after participating in a difficult and prolonged tracheal intubation. 23 Since then, most hospitals have included anesthesiologists, the specialists in airway management, to assist in the tracheal intubation of SARS patients. To minimize aerosol spread by coughing, intubation is performed in sedated and paralyzed patients. Personnel performing intubation, anesthesiologists and respiratory technicians, must take full precautions including the PAPR FIGURE 2 The powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) system consists of a belt-mounted powered air purifier with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. FIGURE 1 A lightweight headpiece is connected to the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) system via a tube hood, gown, gloves etc., as outlined in the previous section. There must be a well-rehearsed plan and protective clothing, intubating equipment and essential drugs must be provided. Particular care is necessary for the removal of potentially contaminated clothing.\n"," In summary, it is extraordinary that the spread of the infection in the GTA outbreak can be traced to one person with unrecognized SARS. The outbreak disrupted the health care and living in a city the size of Toronto. One hopes for greater vigilance in the future.\n"," Anesthesiologists are unique in their frequent exposure to respiratory secretions and blood. We must pay greater heed of our environment to protect ourselves, our patients and our families from infectious disease.

[3] In the later instance, the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces has been documented up to three days [4] , and up to 20 days in cooler environments, [5] such as those found in meat packing plants. [6] The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a zoonotic virus, likely spread from bats to live wet markets in China, [7] and transmitted to humans. [8] While the projected infection mortality rate of this virus (0.4%-3.6%) [9] is lower than other more recent infectious viruses such as H5N1 influenza A virus (60%), MERS-V-CoV (34-36%) and Ebola (41%), the more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to have infected over 200 million individuals worldwide as of August 2021. [10, 11, 12] At this time, human-to-human SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by airborne or fomite transmission have exponentially risen with qRT-PCR cycle-threshold values (>33-34 for the N gene of SARS-CoV-2) known to produce a high rate of both false positive and false negative results, with over 3.1 million reported deaths. [12] Figure 1 Fomite transmission can occur from contact with surfaces contaminated with virion-containing water droplets, produced via coughing or sneezing by an infected individual.\n"," While the implementation of lockdowns, social distancing and mask mandates has stemmed viral spread in most jurisdictions, COVID-fatigue and economic decline have taken their toll. Hospitals, clinics, long-term/senior care facilities and institutions such as schools, nursing homes and prisons have been on the frontlines of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Due to the aerosol nature of the virus, transmission from human to human via droplets or from contaminated surfaces, innovative mitigation and preventative approaches must be adopted. Current virus control has been carried out in part through the implementation of stringent cleaning protocols of all touch surfaces with traditional quaternary ammonium compounds, [13] bleach, stabilized chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, alcohols and other disinfectants as well as UV exposure. [14, 15] While these biocidal chemicals and physical (UV, autoclave, etc.) disinfectants are effective at momentarily disinfecting surfaces of infectious virions, they do not render them antiviral after use.\n"," Since surface-anchored, C18 quaternary ammonium antimicrobials (SiQAC-C18) are known to disrupt phospholipid membranes in bacteria and fungi, it has been previously theorized that a similar mechanism could work to de-protect viruses within the Coronaviridae family, ultimate leading to viral deactivation. [16] [17] [18] There is also additional evidence that quaternary ammonium antimicrobials are effective at deactivating other respiratory viruses. [19, 20] The preventive role of fixed quaternary ammonium antimicrobials on hard or porous surfaces to kill and prevent the buildup of microbial pathogens and biofilms has been well established against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in our research group. [21, 22] Surface-anchored C18 quaternary ammonium cations to metals, plastics and glass materials have also been extensively studied and have been demonstrated to be effective in killing on contact. [23, 24] Antiviral agents for use on inanimate surfaces have been the subject of research and commercial activities since the 1950s, however only a few successful antiviral studies have been undertaken with coatings made with these materials on treated surfaces. Tsao et al first demonstrated the (SiQAC-C18) polymerized onto alginate beads could remove viruses from pharmaceutical solutions and proposed a mechanism of inactivation. [16] A decade later a silane coated sand filter was shown to reduce nonenveloped viruses in water filtration applications. [25] Testing data also supports susceptibility of enveloped influenza virus organisms to the active ingredient in the commercial product tested on glass, [17] plastic [19] and cotton surfaces [20] . More recently, a continuously active antimicrobial coating has been effective at deactivating human coronavirus 229E, a related viral strain within the SARS-CoV-2 family. [26] SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, non-segmented, positive sense RNA virus with a diameter of 65-125 nm, containing single strands of RNA and provided with crown-like spikes on the outer surface. The envelope is formed from the phospholipid membranes of host cells and serves to protect the virions from degradation. [27, 28] We hypothesized that quaternary ammonium antimicrobial, an agent that is able to destabilize phospholipid membranes, could be used as a protective coating that would render SARS-CoV-2 non-infectious.\n"," To investigate the efficacy of quaternary ammonium antimicrobials as antiviral coatings, a commercially available quaternary ammonium antimicrobial treatment, consisting of a coating of SiQAC-C18 that is cured to stainless steel carrier disks, and sent for evaluation against two distinct SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The results from these tests demonstrate evidence of an antiviral effect imparted from these coatings and potential use as a long-lasting antiviral surface treatment.\n"," Carrier Surface Preparation:\n"," Sample carriers consisted of treated and control stainless steel (2 cm, 2B finish) disks, kindly donated by Pegan Industries. At Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada carriers were pre-sorted, pre-cleaned per EN16777:2018, [29] and pre-dried by storing in an 80 °C oven until use. All microbiological operations were performed using aseptic techniques. To reduce variation between carrier treatments, which were handled inside a type A2 biosafety cabinet, the individual carriers with the designated to be treated side up were placed into individual sterile Petri dishes lined with sterile filter paper to absorb over-spray and with the lids opened. The formulated organofunctional silane SiQAC-C18 product (0.5 w/v% active in water) was applied by a commercial sprayer until thoroughly wetted: For samples provided to the Doherty Institute, the SiQAC-C18 product was applied using an air brush sprayer, distance of 20 cm at a 45° angle, 50 μL application volume per carrier, and the Rega Institute via an electrostatic sprayer, distance of 2 feet, 10 seconds spray time, 50 μL application volume). Surface carriers were either pre-treated with the antimicrobial test substance or left as untreated controls. Immediately after treatment, samples were transferred from Ryerson University to the Rega Institute at KU Leuven (S1) and the Doherty Institute at the University of Melbourne (S2, S3) for efficacy testing. Testing was performed 46 and 47 days respectively after the carrier were treated.\n"," Cytotoxicity of SiQAC-C18 active antimicrobial were performed on host monolayer cell lines (VERO cells; ATCC #CCL-18 for VIC01, ATCC #CRL-1586 for GHB-03021) without virus. This was accomplished by subjecting host monolayer cells with 50 μL of SiQAC-C18, following the TCID 50 protocol described above.\n"," The SARS-CoV-2 isolates used in this study were independently isolated and cultured by the Doherty Institute (Victoria, Australia) [30] and Rega Institute [31] . At the Doherty Institute, stocks of SARS-CoV-2 isolate hCoV-19/Australia/VIC01/2020 (VIC01) [3] was produced as previously described [4] and was within 2 passages of the original cultured patient isolate and sequence confirmed to match the publicly available genome data. Titres of the VIC01 isolate stocks was determined to be 10 5.73 TCID 50 /mL. The Rega Institute SARS-CoV-2 isolate hCoV-19/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020 (GHB-03021) was produced as described [31] and used within 42 passages and the stock titre determined to be 10 8.24 TCID 50 /mL.\n"," A 50 μL viral suspension of SARS-CoV-2 patient isolate was inoculated (with soil load for GHB-03021) onto a 2 cm surface of control and SiQAC-C18 coated stainless steel carriers (VIC01 n = 4, GHB-03021 n = 3) and incubated at 20 ± 1 °C for the contact time. The control and treated carriers were inoculated with 50 μL viral stocks of 10 6.91 (GHB-03021) and 10 4.00 (VIC01), respectively. After 10 minutes past each 1-hour drying period, antiviral material on the carrier samples was removed by rinsing with a select recovery media with vigorous pipetting to further recover remaining infectious viruses from the surface. Appropriate 1:10 dilutions of recovered control and test samples were plating onto monolayers prepared and performed as described. [4, 31] The collected sample rinse media was assayed for infectious virus concentration by a cell culture-based viral infectivity assay (TCID 50 assay) [30] [31] . The amount of infectious virus was compared to that from the coated control carrier to determine the efficacy of the coating by the viral reduction by the treated carrier.\n"," qRT-PCR Test 140 μL of sample of VIC01 virions was immediately added to AVL buffer for 10 min, then 100% ethanol to initiate RNA extraction for qRT-PCR analysis. The samples were removed from a BSL 3 facility and the RNA purification was completed using the QiaAmp Viral RNA mini kit in the BSL 2 facility. RNA was stored at -80 °C until processed via qRT-PCR. To evaluate the amount of virus genome present in each sample, a quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene was performed using the SuperScript III OneStep qRT-PCR System with Platinum_ Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsband, CA, USA). The qRT-PCR assay was performed on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using the following conditions: a denaturation step at 55 °C for 10 min and 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 15 s and 58 °C for 30 s). A known amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (generated previously from virus stock cultures) diluted twofold was used to generate a standard curve. The Ct values from the standard curve were used to interpolate the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in each sample.\n"," To test the cytotoxicity of SiQAC-C18, we exposed undiluted solution to Vero and Vero E6 cells, which are the cell lines used for SARS-CoV-2 propagation and quantitation for infectious titre. We found that there was a negligible amount of cell death on the respective cell monolayers (S1, S2). As such, any leaching of SiQAC-18 during the washing and sample elution phase was determined to not induce detrimental effects on the cell monolayer. Thus, any cytopathic effects observed in sample eluates when quantitating the remaining infectious titre by conducting a 50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID 50 ) assay could be attributed to by presence of infectious virus and not cytotoxic effects of the SiQAC-C18 compound.\n"," The ability for SiQAC-C18 to render SARS-CoV-2 non-infectious, was then examined by performing the carrier surface efficacy test. Combined data from studies performed on GHB-03021 and VIC01 isolates is shown in Figure 2 . Data was collected and processed using the Reed-Muench method and was calculated to determine the viral load within the collection media. For the GHB-03021 isolate, a reduction of 10 2.93 was determined (*p = 0.0014 compared to control, unpaired t test, n=3). While, for the VIC01 isolate there was no detectable infectious virus present, indicating a more than 10 3.38 reduction in infectious titre when samples were exposed to SiQAC-C18 (***p < 0.0001 compared to control, unpaired t test, n=4 replicates).\n"," The carrier surface test was used to evaluate the antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 isolates GHB-03021 and VIC01. The treated surfaces for each isolate were prepared by two different methods. An electrostatic sprayer applied SiQAC-C18 to surfaces used for the GHB-03021 exposure, while product was applied using an air brush sprayer for samples exposed to VIC01. After drying and a further contact time of 10 min, surfaces were washed, eluate collected and remaining infectious virus titre determined by a TCID 50 assay.\n"," We next evaluated whether exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to the SiQAC-C18 product could degrade virus genome in addition to reducing the infectious virus titre. To do this, at the same time as collecting samples from the SiQAC-C18 and untreated control exposed VIC01 isolate, an aliquot was processed to extract virus genome. We then performed a quantitative real-time PCR reaction to determine the amount of intact virus Envelope (E) gene present in the sample. Figure 3 reveals that for virus exposed to the SiQAC-C18 product, the genome was significantly degraded, with >10 7 less intact E gene detected compared to VIC01 exposed to the untreated disc (control). These results indicate that the viricidal activity of SiQAC-C18 disrupts the viral membrane and \n"," Our study reveals that SiQAC-C18 is highly viricidal against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, as the carrier surface tests were conducted more than 40 days postaddition of the coating to the surface, then internationally transported to each institute for testing, the robustness of the findings of SiQAC-C18 viricidal activity against SARS-CoV-2 is significant. Further adding to the effectiveness of the SiQAC-C18 product, slightly different methodologies were employed and used two geographically distinct SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Analysis of the published genome sequence data for spike protein, which is the major virion surface glycoprotein involved with cellular attachment and infection, revealed only 1 amino acid difference between the VIC01 and GHB-03021 isolates, with the GHB-03021 isolate matching the original Wuhan sequence. [32] This genome sequence data reveals that the viruses used by our study, despite being isolated from infected humans in geographically distinct locations were closely related. However, the VIC01 SARS-CoV-2 was tested within 2 passages of the original cultured patient isolate, while the GHB-03021 had been passaged in cells more than 40 times and likely may have obtained evolutionary changes resulting in altered viral fitness. This postulation is supported by the fact that there was an ~10 2.5 increase in stock titre of the GHB-03021 virus compared to the VIC01 isolate. Thus, in addition to the coating techniques on the stainless steels surface, these potential differences in SARS-CoV-2 fitness, could have theoretically impacted the viricidal activity of the SiQAC-C18 surface coating. It is therefore noteworthy that both institutes independently revealed SiQAC-C18 exhibits viricidal activity against SARS-CoV-2. These findings are in agreement with previous data that demonstrated antiviral activity of SiQAC-C18 active is independent of the coating substrate (plastic, glass, and textiles), and the type of enveloped virus or variant. [19, 20] A viral load between 10 4.8 -10 6.3 per carrier (as indicated by the plate recovery control challenge) is the dose recommended for inoculation to determine antimicrobial activity of disinfectants against viruses dried on surfaces (ASTM E1053) [33] and on fingerpads cleaned with handrub agents (ASTM E1838). [34] Inoculums added to each carrier were slightly higher (GHB-03021 isolate), or slightly lower (VIC01 isolate) than recommended, but testing revealed >10 3 reduction compared to untreated controls, regardless of infectious dose added to the treated and untreated discs. We postulate that the reduction in infectious titre indicates that the SiQAC-C18 product may have rendered SARS-CoV-2 non-infectious, either by altering the ability for the virion to attach and infect the cell by changing surface glycoprotein structures, or by causing virion membrane lysis and degradation. Given that the qRT-PCR analysis performed on the VIC01 isolate revealed degradation of viral genomic material when exposed to the antimicrobial coated surface, it is likely that structures integral to virion integrity, such as the viral envelope of SARS-CoV-2 are damaged following contact with a SiQAC-C18 functionalized surface (Figure 4 ). Following this, the SiQAC-C18 product either then continued act directly on the RNA genome, or environmental exposure induced degradation of the viral RNA.\n"," Proposed mechanism of enveloped virus deactivation by SiQAC-C18 treated surface demonstrating adsorption, disruption and deactivation of virion particles.\n"," In alignment with our current findings of SiQAC-C18 antiviral activity, antimicrobial organofunctional silane coatings have been demonstrated to reduce SARS-CoV-2 isolates on treated surfaces. While our study demonstrated the antiviral activity of SiQAC-C18 on non-porous metal coupons, we expect a similar efficacy to be achieved on a variety of porous and non-porous surfaces including textiles, glass, furniture, and plastics found in hospitals, transit, and other public settings, similar to the antimicrobial results observed quaternary ammonium treated surfaces.

So, it is necessary to rearrange ophthalmologist routine clinical practice in order to control viral spread and try to maximize patient and health-care provider's safety.\n"," Articles were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published between December 2019 and April 2020.\n"," A total of 9 articles was included.\n"," In a cross-sectional study of Liwen Chen et al., was studied the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of 534 cases of COVID-19 in China [8] .\n"," The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. There was a similar number of men and women (134/ 129 and 134/137, respectively) in the two hospitals.\n"," Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom.\n"," Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular symptoms.

These 25 patients did not report any other eye disease history or any symptoms associated with intraocular diseases (such as iritis, choroiditis, and retinal disease), which suggests that conjunctivitis may be the primary cause of the conjunctival congestion.\n"," Conjunctival congestion and positive RT-PCR in pharyngeal swabs were found at the same time in four COVID-19 patients.\n"," The conclusion of the study is that the conjunctival swab test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in patients with conjunctival congestion.\n"," Moreover, among the 25 cases with conjunctival congestion, 18 (72%) had a history of hand-eye contact, 13 with frequent contact and 12 who never washed their hands, suggesting that hand-eye contact is possibly a high risk factor.\n"," A study in the New England Journal of Medicine by Zhong Nanshan and other [1] , that analys the clinical features of patients infected with COVID-19, reported nine cases with conjunctival congestion among the 1099 cases enrolled (0.8%).\n"," In a retrospective cohort study by Zohu and others, has been reported 3 cases of conjunctival congestion in 67 COVID-19 patients or suspected cases [9] .

One patient presented with conjunctivitis as the first symptom but had a negative conjunctival sac 2019-nCoV test. This kind of conjunctivitis has no specific manifestation, and can present in one eye or two eyes. In the early stage, it appears as common conjunctival hyperemia with fewer secretions. It is watery and akin to thin mucus. Occasionally small pieces of conjunctival hemorrhage are seen.\n"," The authors concluded that the incidence of conjunctivitis in patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is not high and that the concept that the virus is transmitted through the conjunctival route it is not supported.\n"," Jianhua Xia and collegues evalueted the presence of coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [10] .\n"," Thirty confirmed novel NCP patients were selected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 26 January 2020 to 9 February 2020.

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 via the host functional receptor is mediated by ACE2 which is expressed in human cornea and conjunctival tissues.\n"," They concluded that the negative results of conjunctival sac in other 71 patients may be owing to the lower viral concentration, the sampling time lag (mean time 18.15 days), and the lower positive rate of the inefficient diagnostic method.\n"," Ziad and collegue [14] found that tracheal aspirates yelded significantly higher SARS-CoV loads, compared with the nasopharyngeal swab and sputum specimens. This suggests that the viral concentration and genome fraction is diverse in different sites. In consideration of the ocular surface is an open microenvironment, and the viral may transport to the inferior meatus of the nose rapidly, the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in ocular surface is likely to be very low.\n"," De Wit et collegues [15] demonstrated that, in the rhesus macaque model, MERS-CoV RNA could detect in the conjunctiva, and the viral loads could no longer be detected in the conjunctiva 6 days post infection.\n"," Another thing needs to be considered is that the lower positiive rate of RT-PCR makes early of SARS-CoV-2 a challenge. Therefore, improvements in the sensitivity of molecular diagnostic methods need to be taking in the future.\n"," A PubMed search on 24th March 2020 found no evidence that contact lens wearers are more likely to contract COVID-19 than spectacle wearers. The likely belief for this being a concern relates to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated in tears, albeit to date, infrequently [16] and also that the virus is known to be transferred by hand contact, and could be transferred to contact lenses during their application and removal. Thus, it is understandable this has been raised as a potential concern for increasing their risk of exposure to the virus. The consistent advice to protect individuals from the virus is to employ frequent handwashing with soap and water. The lipid envelope of the virus can be emulsified by surfactants such as those found in simple soap, which kills the virus [17, 18] .Best practice advice for contact lens wearers includes the same instructions that should be impered under all situations, regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic. When using contact lenses, careful and washing with soap ant water followed by hand drying with unused paper towels is paramount. For contact wearers, this should occur before every contact lens application and removal, and such practice reduces the risks of infection and inflammatory responses and is highly effective [19] . It follows that as long as contact lens wearers are using correct hand hygiene techniques, they should be limiting any virus transmission to their ocular surface, and indeed, as already stated, there is currently no evidence that they are at any higher risk of developing COVID-19 infection than non-wearers [20] .\n"," To date, there have been no laboratory studies reported on the ability of coronaviruses to adhere to contact lenses, and none on the ability of disinfectants to kill coronaviruses adhered to contact lenses [20] .\n"," There is no evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tears or conjunctival tissue of asymptomatic patients and even in those with confirmed disease, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface is low [16, 21, 22] . Thus, binding of SARS-CoV-2 to contact lenses from the ocular surface in asymptomatic wearers would be unlikely [20] .\n"," A recent paper [23] has been cited as suggesting that silicone hydrogels are more likely to bind SARS-CoV-2 than hydrogels. However, this paper did not examine contact lens materials [20] . The inanimate surfaces described in the paper [23] which most closely resemble contact lens materials were \"plastic\" and silicon rubber. Neither of these materials appropriately represents the complex bulk and surface chemistry of contemporary contact lens materials and cannot be used to reflect the likely binding of any pathogenetic organism to modern day contact lenses [20] . The factors governing the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to inanimate surfaces are so far unknown, but for a variety of waterborne viruses the major driving factors were electrostatic interactions (charge driven), followed by hydrophobic interactions, with only minor impact from van der Waals interactions [20] .\n"," The purpose of this review is to highlight the possible ocular presentation of COVID-19 infection and the consequence of the pandemic in the daily ophtalmology routine.\n"," Conjunctivitis (and keratoconjunctivitis) can be the first symptom in infected patients. The virus can be present in tear and conjuntival secretions, requiring maximum attention.\n"," It's important to understand if COVID-19 could spread through the ocular route or present as the primary infected site.\n"," Ocular implications should also be considered for therapy. In fact, one potential treatment is chloroquine and its derivatives [24, 25] , including hydroxychloroquine, which have both antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. These compounds are effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, but in vivo data are lacking. Although some encouraging outcomes have been reported, further evidence from coordinated multicentre trials is required.\n"," Hydroxychloroquine can induced Retinal Toxicity [26] after long term usage. Retinopathy is rarely seen before 10 or more years of usage at the recommended dosage [27] . However, the doses proposed to treat COVID-19 are 4-5 times higher [28] and this must be considered during the therapy and the ocular implication must be investigated. It's important to analays the ocular fundus before, during and after the treatment. The exponential increase in the number of Covid-19 cases was like a tsunami for health care companies, which were not ready to face this emergency. Ophthalmology departments were also affected by the reorganization of healthcare services. We submitted a questionnaire to 14 health care companies present in Piedmont, in Italy.\n"," In all there was a reduction in ambulatory activity, reserved only for urgent non-deferrable services. There was a reduction in shifts in the operating room, reserved for emergencies. In five cases, operating rooms were intended for COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms, sending urgent ophtalmology patients to other better equipped hospitals. Furthermore, in six hospitals, ophthalmology personnel were sent to the COVID-19 departments to carry out non-specialist assistance activities.\n"," A dedicated Covid-free ophthalmology department has been maintained in only four healthcare companies. In other cases, beds with other specialties have been merged, with the aim of freeing up as many hospital wards as possible for patients with COVID-19.\n"," Even when the emergency is over, the guard cannot be lowered. In fact, ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals remain at higher risk of infection, due to the proximity to the patients during the physical examination.\n"," It is important to think carefully about how to take care of patients until the World is declared COVID-free.\n"," Several infection control measures are recommended (Fig. 1) , subdivided into three categories [29] :\n"," use of PPE environmental control administrative control.\n"," In addition, the use of telemedicine must be encouraged to provide care for non-urgent cases. Telemedicine is defined as the use of information technologies to support healthcare between participants who are separated from each other [30] . Fortunately, the current technologies allow an optimal management for less severe cases. \"Routine post-op\" care for cataract surgery in nonglaucomatous eyes, for example, could likely be cut further via telemedicine.\n"," The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) [31] has published a report advising ophthalmologists to wear masks and eye protection when caring for patients potentially infected with COVID-19. In our opinion, it's important to use of PPE for all cases regardless of SARS status, as well as hand hygiene measures and use of gloves, N95 masks, goggles and gowns. The patient should not speaking during the slit lamp examination.\n"," The installation of large plastic protective screens on slit lamps (Fig. 2) is essential to minimize the risk of droplet contamination between the patient and ophthalmologist. Even AAO [31] recommended this installation.\n"," It's important the use of disinfectants specific to COVID-19 [32] , including diluted household bleach (five tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water) and alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol.\n"," Lai et al. [29] reported the importance of air ventilation in waiting areas.\n"," Basic survey to identify patients with possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or the development of COVID-19 should be performed.\n"," This should include questions about symptoms (fever, dry cough, sore throat, headache, loss of taste/smell) and proximity to a validated or suspected COVID-19 case as well as travel to an endemic region [31] . This screening should be performed by calling the patient in advance; in alternative, at the front desk once the patient arrives at the clinic.\n"," Balancing between the need to provide care and save sight and the risk of contracting COVID-19 should be considered with respect to each patient.\n"," In addition, social distancing must be implemented in waiting areas by blocking alternating seats (Fig. 3) .\n"," Further precautions can be taken during the visit [33] :\n"," the patient should enter without accompanying adults, if possible; Imaging devices will necessitate careful cleaning between patients. Automated perimetry needs to be completely revisited, since the perimetry bowl is not only a potential source of viral spread, but also notoriously difficult to clean without damage; use of disposable tonometers with single-use protective sleeves. Pneumotonometers and air-puff tonometry, both of which can presumably aerosolize the tear film and viral particles, may need to be avoided; \n"," It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the ocular manifestations of COVID-19.\n"," The studies analaysed, in fact, have some limitations. First, the sample size and the covered population consisted mainly of patients with mild disease. Moreover, the studies are often descriptive study, without a correlation analysis. Finally, no normal population was observed in the studies, so a normal control group should be included for comparison in future studies.\n"," Anyway, with the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and with it's high infectivity, it is necessary to rearrange ophthalmologist routine clinical practice in order to control viral spread and try to maximize patient and health-care provider's safety.\n"," It is essential to create COVID-free ophthalmology ward and a ward for suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Individuals with non-urgent ophthalmic problems who are suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases can be postoponed for medical treatment.\n"," If the visit is urgent, they must be evaluated in a designated isolated clinic.\n"," In the long run, it is helpful to capitalize on this experience and reorganize how we offer healthcare to our patients. In this regard, it is useful to consider a Hub and Spoke model, with a greater focus on prevention in the territorial hospital, referring only the most serious cases to major Eye clinics. \n","Score: 8.33366741105754\n","\n","Title: Bringing Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the Surface: Is there a Role for Fomites?\n","Body Text: The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into a global public health threat with debate regarding transmission. The initial Wuhan strain and subsequent variants have evolved to become more transmissible and deadly than influenza, with Omicron reaching the R o (transmissibility) of measles.\n"," Infection prevention and control measures have relied on widespread adherence to behavior-based policies including mask-wearing, physical distancing, avoiding crowds, and hand hygiene to reduce virus transmission. Early data suggested that the primary mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was respiratory droplets, along with other suggested routes throughout this pandemic including fomites, wastewater, and respiratory aerosols.\n"," Fomites as a mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were thought to play a more prominent role at the beginning of the pandemic, with laboratory studies revealing the virus could persist on plastic, stainless steel, and other surfaces for hours to days. Case reports early in the pandemic also suggested fomite transmission. Xie et al. reported five COVID-19 cases where individuals from two separate families in an apartment complex tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Both families stated that they had no contact with the other family, and the authors hypothesized that transmission likely occurred through touching an elevator button contaminated with nasal discharge [1] . Another study reported on three COVID-19 cases in a managed isolation facility, hypothesizing that transmission may have occurred via the surface of a shared trashcan [2] . The accumulation of this anecdotal data sparked headlines and various guidance measures on how to disinfect everything from door handles to groceries. By May 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other agencies were recommending that everyone carefully and thoroughly wash their hands for 20 seconds and \"thoroughly\" disinfect all contact surfaces, particularly those frequently touched, such as elevator buttons and door handles.\n"," Data in favor of fomite transmission was first contested in a July 2020 study [3] , with literature strengthening this argument in different settings. The Centers for Disease Control and A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 Prevention (CDC) had stated at the time that \"it is possible for people to be infected through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects (fomites), but the risk was generally considered low.\" [4] Despite the CDC stating that fomite transmission risk is low, many individuals and institutions expanded their use of disinfection products at home and elsewhere to items beyond frequently touched surfaces (e.g. grocery packaging and food take-out containers, elevator buttons), even leaving delivered food sitting overnight. The overuse and misuse of cleaning and disinfection products can also lead to negative consequences such as added cost and health impact to disinfectors, such as the increased risk of COPD and asthma flares and damage to airways after entering contaminated rooms [5, 6] . Some felt the more disinfection the better. Where to actually draw the line on disinfection was never agreed on. This article will 1) review the data behind the role of fomites in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in various settings; 2) discuss the role disinfection and disinfectants play in preventing transmission of COVID-19 as well as other infections; 3) discuss the impact of environmental factors such as type of surface, humidity, and temperature in SARS-CoV-2 transfer to and from surfaces; and 4) review uncertainties and provide recommendations. Due to its inherent predictive uncertainties and ambiguities, as we have witnessed throughout the pandemic, we will not discuss transmission modeling.\n"," The initial set of studies (N=1206) considered for this systematic literature review was compiled from a search on the PubMed database on December 6, 2021, with the following query:\n"," (Covid-19 or SARS-CoV-2) and (Surface Transmission or Fomite). Subsequently, 727 studies were excluded because they were duplicates or completely unrelated. Next, 265 were excluded based on the content of their titles, which were related to fomites but did not touch upon the transmission A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 risk. Lastly, 143 studies were excluded based on the content of their abstracts. This left 71 studies that were reviewed and included in the paper with 28 additional papers found from other sources.\n"," Subsequently, papers were further analyzed for redundant information and the final number of papers discussed became n=50.\n"," To evaluate the significance of fomites in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there have been two approaches: study of viral persistence in controlled laboratory environments, and viral detection in real-world settings. A portion of these research papers is summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. We will summarize the findings of these two approaches and discuss how they relate to one another.\n"," Studies of viral persistence on surfaces typically involve depositing a set titer of virus onto cut \"coupons\" of a variety of materials. Subsequently, the surfaces are swabbed at regular intervals and the viral infectivity is measured by observing the cytopathic effect on cultured cells . [3] These studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could retain infectivity for as little as 30 minutes on paper to as long as a week on the outer layer of a surgical mask [7] [8] [9] . Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV-2 had a concerningly long persistence time. These initial findings established that surface transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was indeed possible, but more evidence was needed to determine the nature and magnitude of that risk. That data would come from studies of viral detection in real-world settings.\n"," In a protocol from the World Health Organization (WHO), surface sampling of coronavirus in real-world settings ought to include two steps: detection of RNA and assessment of viable virus present [10] . Due to limited availability of BSL-3 or BSL-4 laboratories looking for live virus, researchers tended to rely more strongly on PCR testing looking for viral fragments rather than live virus [11] [12] [13] .\n"," The literature for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection studies with PCR is vast, and a large portion of A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 6 published studies focused on swabbing areas of perceived risk, such as hospital and laboratory surfaces. These are summarized in Table 2 . Compared to community settings, hospital environments see many more infected individuals and are expected to have a higher concentration of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. However, other factors are at play as well. Ribaric found that in hospitals, ICU rooms were most frequently contaminated, and the most intense areas of SARS-CoV-2 contamination were near the air vents. In areas with laminar air flow and negative pressure ventilation, contaminants were more likely to be swept out of reach instead of being deposited onto surfaces [14] .\n"," There is an extensive body of research focused on swabbing public and community settings.\n"," A small minority of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection studies done in community settings failed to detect any SARS-CoV-2. These were done at a Pennsylvania school [15] , and a Brazilian market [16] . In other studies, RNA was found in nearly every conceivable place: commercial boarding residencies (2/428 swabs) [17] , playgrounds (2/43 swabs), drinking fountains (1/25 swabs) [18] , and supermarket keyboards and handles (13/300) [19] .\n"," A small number of the studies that completed procedures of SARS-CoV-2 viral culture and isolation succeeded in observing cytopathic effect (presumed to indicate live virus) from swabs collected in real-world settings. Marcenac swabbed the household surfaces of COVID-19 patients and found 23/150 swabs were positive, including nightstands, and pillows. Only one sample from the nightstand of a high viral load infected patient produced a cytopathic effect [20] . Ahn detected viable virus on the endotracheal tube of one patient and bed handles of another, although researchers noted that the patient had a tendency to spit out sputum frequently, and this may have contributed to the result [21] . Santarpia cultured viable virus only from a windowsill of a patient isolation room. [22] These illustrate that SARS-CoV-2 surface transmission is possible, but may be the exception rather than the rule. Other studies that completed these viral tests for viability found mRNA failed to have a cytopathic effect on any of their cell cultures (Table 2) [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .\n"," A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 7 These disparities between viral culture, cytopathic effect, and PCR findings have led to thinking that fomite transmission is exaggerated [30] . One prominent explanation is that viral viability drops much faster than mRNA. A positive PCR test might thus be indicative of a non-infectious remnant rather than a viable viral particle [31] . Viable influenza could only be recovered from surfaces for 2 weeks while mRNA was detectable for 7 weeks [32] .\n"," There are at least two possible explanations as to why viable SARS-CoV-2 persisted in controlled environments but was largely undetected in the real world. The first is that viral culture assays are not picking up viable virus even when it is present. The development of a rapid viability assay may be able to streamline the laborious process and increase the sensitivity of viral isolation and culture assays [33] . Such innovations may soon give us a better picture of the risk posed by SARS-CoV-2 fomites. The second is that the viral loads used in studies of persistence were unrealistically high. These laboratory studies tend to use high viral loads of 10 5 TCID50/mL or more (Table 1) , which corresponds to a PCR cycle threshold (C t value) of around 16 [34] . This is much higher than the typical threshold used in real-world detection studies, which use a cycle threshold of around 40.\n"," The disconnect may also come from the protein-rich liquid media used in experiments.\n"," Unrealistic conditions could allow for the virus to remain viable for longer periods of time than they would in real-world settings [30] . Therefore, the mRNA detected with PCR may instead be inactive remnants of the virus rather than a meaningful measurement. Perhaps the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be treated like wastewater samples: predictors of infection rates in a geographical location instead of a hazard in the individual [35] . The actual dose range of infection has also not been agreed upon.\n"," A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 8\n"," At the same time as studies of viral persistence on surfaces and studies of environmental detection of SARS-CoV-2 were underway, efforts to identify a suitable model organism were also underway. Rhesus macaques were considered, but available BSL-3 facilities for handling non-human primates were scarce. Transgenic human-ACE2-expressing mice were highly sought after, but their expression was not physiologic and supply was greatly limited [36] . Unlike the other two, the Syrian hamster model and ferret models were both more commonly accessible and appeared to simulate human SARS-CoV-2 infection to an acceptable level.\n"," It's been well known that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted between animals that were physically separated. A ferret study found that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between ferrets up to 1 meter apart, although this may be the result of fur, bedding, or other large particles that were blown from one cage to the other [37] . But it took further study to investigate which routes of transmission were greater contributors. One Syrian hamster study investigated three routes of transmission: intranasal, aerosol, and fomite, and concluded that all three resulted in seroconversion of sentinel hamsters by day 14 (N = 12). In a follow-up study, 8 additional sentinel animals were introduced to the soiled cages of intranasally infected animals, and 4 of 8 seroconverted. Hamsters infected intranasally and with aerosol exposure experienced significantly greater disease burden and weight loss than fomite-exposed hamsters [38] .\n"," Due to biological differences between humans and animal models, it is unclear what role fomites play in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in humans. However, animal studies do give credence to the possibility that surface transmission occurs between humans but produces minor effects when compared to respiratory routes of transmission. There are effective disinfectants, disinfection, handwashing and cleaning processes for rooms, handrails, and corridors. There are personal and institutional hygiene practices. With this in mind, there is still scant literature regarding handwashing and disinfection effectiveness, and how it differs between organisms (i.e. MRSA, VRE, C. difficile, norovirus, and coronaviruses. There is also the nature of the surface characteristics (i.e. wood, metal, paper), and ambient conditions of temperature, and humidity [39] .\n"," Since little work has been done with SARS-CoV-2, other enveloped viruses may be a better comparison than bacteria such as Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas. Norovirus, for example, has been extensively studied. Baker used PCR to access the transfer of norovirus from contaminated fecal material via fingers and cloths to hand-contact surfaces. He found that norovirus was consistently transferred via the fingers to melamine surfaces and from there to other typical handcontact surfaces, such as taps, door handles and telephone receivers, seven clean surfaces in total.\n"," With the exception of fecal soiling, he found that detergent-based cleaning with a cloth to produce a visibly clean surface consistently failed to eliminate norovirus contamination.\n"," A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 In situations in which an individual does not have consistent access to soap and water, CDC, WHO, and FDA recommend, for the general public, the use of hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol to reduce microbial burden [40, 41] . In vitro studies revealed that hand sanitizers containing 60%-80% ethanol demonstrated 4-6 log reductions in 15-30 seconds against bacterial and fungal species [42] . Alcohol-based sanitizers have been shown to deliver rapid bactericidal activity toward several bacterial pathogens in addition to activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, Ebolavirus, Zikavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 [43, 44] . Handwashing even with soap for 20 seconds, removes sebum, sweat, and microflora from hands while increasing pH and hydrophobicity. Handwashing is effective in preventing certain hospital-associated infections, especially MRSA, C.difficile, norovirus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) with less data on influenza and even less on SARS-CoV-2.\n"," Another route of possible transmission involves wastewater. SARS-CoV-2 may show up in wastewater for varying periods, but there is no clear evidence it is transmitted person-to-person by this route. This may be similar to PCR positivity on conventional surfaces as described.\n"," We don't know if some variants enhance surface viability more than others, and cause subsequent augmented fomite transmission, as a lack of adequate sequencing had precluded these studies. Will better hand toilet hygiene cut down on wastewater fecal exposure and surface transmission? The inadequtely studied timing, duration, temperature, and quantity of exposure to a surface from an infected individual might be critical in determining the degree of transmission.\n"," A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t may cause 80% of cases [45] . This so-called \"Pareto Principle\" is getting backing for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Three studies by Abbott, Miller, and Adam, using three different patient cohorts,\n"," showed that a small percent of infections account for a large proportion of spread.\n"," Transmission due to superspreaders and superspreader events have been poorly studied, and are probably multifactorial, especially if there is an outdoor, colder temperature component.\n"," The specific contribution of surfaces in this setting has not been adequately studied due to the perceived dominance of respiratory spread by \"exchanged air\". Further experiments using sequencing and quantification of live virus or cytopathic effect will be helpful especially in small outbreak serttings.\n"," What is the disinfecting role of enzymes such as DNAses on human skin surfaces? Studies on influenza A inactivation on skin suggest that skin appears to have antiviral properties that cause rapid inactivation of viruses on human hands compared to inanimate surfaces [46] . The relevance to fomite transmission here has to be worked out.\n"," There are implications of overdoing handwashing and disinfection. This includes excessive irritation to the skin, the personnel needed, the cost of materials, and the added exposure indoors for those doing the disinfection in a potentially contaminated closed environment that might lead to added respiratory transmission.. Aiello determined the value of hand hygiene for influenza or influenza-like illness prevention, and found \"handwashing habits were the same in both face maskonly and control groups, which suggests that mask use alone may provide a reduction in respiratory illness regardless of handwashing practices.\" Thus, handwashing is important but may be more important in preventing influenza and other respiratory viruses than SARS-CoV-2.\n"," Is SARS-CoV-2 spread primarily by large droplets or by small-particle aerosols? This may well be relevant to fomite transmission. Alford noted that the more likely the virus is transmitted by large M a n u s c r i p t 12 droplets, the more likely hand hygiene will reduce transmission. Hand hygiene may not be beneficial if small particle aerosol is the main route of transmission [47] [48] .\n"," Sequencing, culture, and viral load measurements of surfaces have been inadequate.

control are 1) asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, 2) low incidence or lack of dominant systemic symptoms such as fever, 3) airborne transmission that may need a high infectious dose, and 4) super-spread events (SSEs). Patients with COVID-19 have high viral loads at symptom onset or even a few days prior to symptom onset, and most patients with COVID-19 have only mild respiratory symptoms or merely pauci-/null-symptoms. These characteristics of the virus enable it to easily spread to the community because most patients are unaware of their potential infectivity, and symptombased control measures cannot prevent this type of transmission. Furthermore, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is also capable of airborne transmission in conditions such as aerosol-generating procedures, under-ventilated indoor spaces, and over-crowded areas. In this context, universal mask-wearing is important to prevent both outward and inward transmission until an adequate degree of herd immunity is achieved through vaccination. Lastly, the SSEs of SARS-CoV-2 transmission emphasize the importance of reducing contacts by limiting social gatherings. The above-mentioned transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 have culminated in the failure of long-lasting quarantine measures, and indicate that only highly effective vaccines can keep the communities safe from this deadly, multifaceted virus.\n","Score: 11.383346214055752\n","\n","Title: Transmission patterns and evolution of respiratory syncytial virus in a community outbreak identified by genomic analysis\n","Abstract: Detailed information on the source, spread and evolution of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during seasonal community outbreaks remains sparse. Molecular analyses of attachment (G) gene sequences from hospitalized cases suggest that multiple genotypes and variants co-circulate during epidemics and that RSV persistence over successive seasons is characterized by replacement and multiple new introductions of variants. No studies have defined the patterns of introduction, spread and evolution of RSV at the local community and household level. We present a whole genome sequence analysis of 131 RSV group A viruses collected during 6-month household-based RSV infection surveillance in Coastal Kenya, 2010 within an area of 12 km 2 . RSV infections were identified by regular symptom-independent screening of all household members twice weekly. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RSV A viruses in nine households were closely related to genotype GA2 and fell within a single branch of the global phylogeny. Genomic analysis allowed the detection of householdspecific variation in seven households. For comparison, using only G gene analysis, household-specific variation was found only in one of the nine households. Nucleotide changes were observed both intra-host (viruses identified from same individual in follow-up sampling) and inter-host (viruses identified from different household members) and these coupled with sampling dates enabled a partial reconstruction of the within household transmission chains. The genomic evolutionary rate for the household dataset was estimated as 2.307 Â 10 À 3 (95% highest posterior density: 0.935-4.165Â 10 À 3 ) substitutions/site/year. We conclude that (i) at the household level, most RSV infections arise from the introduction of a single virus variant followed by accumulation of household specific variation and (ii) analysis of complete virus genomes is crucial to better understand viral transmission in the community. A key question arising is whether prevention of RSV introduction or spread within the household by vaccinating key transmitting household members would lead to a reduced onward community-wide transmission.\n","Score: 11.314011881939038\n","\n","Title: Simple mathematical models for controlling COVID-19 transmission through social distancing and community awareness\n","Abstract: The novel COVID-19 pandemic is a current, major global health threat. Up till now, there is no fully approved pharmacological treatment or a vaccine. In this study, simple mathematical models were employed to examine the dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19 taking into consideration social distancing and community awareness. Both situations of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous population were considered. Based on the calculations, a sufficient degree of social distancing based on its reproductive ratio is found to be effective in controlling COVID-19, even in the absence of a vaccine. With a vaccine, social distancing minimizes the sufficient vaccination rate to control the disease. Community awareness also has a great impact in eradicating the virus transmission. The model is simulated on small-world networks and the role of social distancing in controlling the infection is explained.\n","Score: 11.07492765347165\n","\n","Title: Evidence of early community transmission of Omicron (B1.1.529) in Delhi-A city with very high seropositivity and past-exposure!\n","Abstract: Background: Since identification, infections by new SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron are rapidly increasing worldwide. There is huge gap of knowledge regarding virus behaviour in the population from low and middle income countries. Delhi being unique population with a high seropositivity and vaccination rate against COVID-19 infection. We aimed to study the epidemiological and clinical presentations of few early cases of community spread of Omicron infection in the state.\n"," Methods: This is a prospective study where respiratory specimen from all RT-PCR confirmed positive cases between November 25 th -December 23 rd 2021 collected from five districts of Delhi were subjected to whole genome sequencing. Complete demographic and clinical details were recorded. We also analyzed the formation of local and familial clusters and eventual community transmission.\n"," Findings: Out of the 264 cases included during study period, 68.9% (n=182)were identified as Delta and its sub-lineages while 31.06% (n=82) were Omicron with BA.1 as the predominant sub-lineage (73.1%). Most of the Omicron cases were asymptomatic (n=50,61%) and not requiring any hospitalizations. A total of 72 (87.8%) cases were fully vaccinated. 39.1% (n=32) had a history of travel and/or contacts while 60.9 (n=50) showed a community transmission. A steep increase in the daily progression of Omicron cases with its preponderance in the community was observed from 1.8% to 54%.\n"," Interpretation: This study is among the first from India to provide the evidence of community transmission of Omicron with significantly increased breakthrough infections, decreased hospitalization rates, and lower rate of symptomatic infections among individuals with high seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n","Score: 11.010623126702473\n","\n","Title: School and community reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mathematical modeling study\n","Abstract: The closure of communities, including schools, has been adopted to control the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in most countries. Operating schools safely during the pandemic requires a balance between health risks and the need for in-person learning. We use compartmental models to explore school reopening scenarios.\n"," Using demographic and epidemiological data between July 31 and November 23, 2020 from the city of Toronto, we developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infectious-Recovered-Hospitalized-Isolated model. Our model with age, household, and community transmission allow us to study the impact of schools open in September 2020. The model mimics the transmission in households, the community, and schools, accounting for differences in infectiousness between adults and children and youth and adults' working status. We assessed the extent to which school opening may have contributed to COVID-19 resurgence in the fall and simulated scenarios for the safe reopening of schools up to May 31, 2021. We further considered the impact of the introduction of the new variant of concern.\n"," Findings Though a slight increase in infections among adults (2.8%) and children (5.4%) is anticipated by the end of the year, safe school opening is possible with stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) decreasing the risk of transmission in the community and the household. We found that while school reopening was not the key driver in virus resurgence, but rather it was community spread that determined the outbreak trajectory, brief school closures did reduce infections when transmission risk within the home was low. When considered possible crossinfection amongst households, communities, and schools, we found that home transmission was crucial for mitigating the epidemic and safely operating schools. Simulating the introduction of a new strain with higher infectiousness, we observed substantial increases in infections, even when both schools and communities are closed.\n"," Schools can open safely under strict maintenance of strict public health measures in the community. The gradual opening of schools and communities can only be achieved by maintaining NPIs and mitigating household transmission risk to avoid the broader escape of infections acquired in schools into the community via households. If the new COVID-19 strain is more infectious for children, public spaces, including schools, should be closed, and additional NPIs, including the use of masks, should be extended to toddlers.\n"," The design of a gradual school reopening strategy remains at the heart of decision-making on reopening after shut-downs to control the epidemic. Although available studies have assessed the risk of school reopening by modelling the transmission across schools and communities, it remains unclear whether the risk is due to increased transmission in adults or children and youth.We used GoogleScholar and PubMed searches to identify previous published works. We used te following terms: \"school closure\", \"covid 19 school closure\", \"reopening schools\", \"reopening screening school\", \"school household second wave model\". The search of the studies ended in January 2021. Papers in other languages than English and letters were excluded from the search. Two modelling studies examined the effects of screening and delayed school reopening, two other agent-based modelling studies explored the epidemic spread across different age groups.\n"," We find that the resurgence of COVID-19 in Toronto in fall 2020 mainly resulted from the increase of contact rate among adults in the community, and that the degree of in-person attendance had the most significant impact on transmission in schools. To our knowledge, our work is the first to investigate the resurgence in infections following school reopening and the impact of risk mitigation measures in schools operation during the pandemic. Our novel and comprehensive model considers the age and household structure, but also considers three different settings, school, household and community. We further examined the effects of selfscreening procedures, class size, and schooling days on transmission, which enabled us to compare scenarios of school reopening separately for both adults and children and youth, and model the cross-infection between them to avoid potential underestimation. We found that after schools opened, reducing household transmission was crucial for mitigating the epidemic since it can reduce cross-infection amongst households, communities and schools. Lastly, given the recent report of SARS-CoV-2 variant (VOC202012/01), we investigated the impact of the new variant that may be more infectious in children and youth.\n"," Our analysis can inform policymakers of planning the safe reopening of schools during COVID-19. We suggest that integrating strict NPIs and school control measures are crucial for safe reopening. When schools are open, reducing transmission risk at home and community is paramount in curbing the spread of COVID-19. Lastly, if children are more susceptible to the new COVID-19 VOC, both schools and community must be closed, the time children spend in essential services locations minimized, and NPI's for those aged less than three years enforced.\n","Score: 10.499143183497036\n","\n","Title: Exit strategies: optimising feasible surveillance for detection, elimination and ongoing prevention of COVID-19 community transmission\n","Abstract: Following successful implementation of strong containment measures by the community, Australia is now close to the point of eliminating detectable community transmission of COVID-19. We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID-19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated.\n"," We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow-up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population.\n"," Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID-19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22-33 contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests/million population per week using 1/16 pooling of samples.\n"," Screening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system.\n","Score: 10.486205722792844\n","\n","Title: Title: Tracking the onset date of the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Western Countries\n","Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread around the world during 2020, but the precise time in which the virus began to spread locally is currently unknown for most countries. Here, we estimate the probable onset date of the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 from the cumulative number of deaths reported during the early stage of the epidemic in Western Europe and the Americas. Our results support that SARS-CoV-2 probably started to spread locally in all western countries analyzed between the middle of January and early February 2020, thus long before community transmission was officially recognized and control measures were implemented.\n","Score: 10.27933770282372\n","\n","Title: Environmental Science and Pollution Research Wastewater-based epidemiology: a new frontier for tracking environmental persistence and community transmission of COVID-19\n","Abstract: Recent research in many parts of the world has pointed towards evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both treated and raw municipal wastewater discharged by communities. Therefore, concerns regarding it being a possible enteric virus are abundant. Past history of SARS-CoV-1 outbreaks and viral survival information helps in establishing information regarding possible viral infectivity and survival of SARS-CoV-2. The paper examines the existing strategies and techniques including the efficacy of laboratory-based RT-qPCR technique for tracking environmental persistence and community transmission of COVID-19. Analysis of studies targeting untreated and treated wastewater as source of samples is carried out. The analysis shows that untreated samples were mostly positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the target studies. Infectivity estimation from viral load data was found to be about two orders of magnitude higher than actual case data in one of the studies. Additionally, relevant research on environmental survivability of SARS-CoV-2 and possible gaps are examined. Biosensors and excretion metabolite tracking in viral detection are also examined, which hold tremendous importance for future research. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) shows incredible promise in the near future for tracking environmental persistence and community transmission of highly infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. With limited research available on SARS-CoV-2 with regard to WBE, it is imperative that focus be established on the evidence-based targeted studies.\n","Score: 10.192693743915957\n","\n","Title: Do school closures and school reopenings affect community transmission of COVID-19? A systematic review of observational studies\n","Abstract: Objectives To systematically reivew the observational evidence of the effect of school closures and school reopenings on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Setting Schools (including early years settings, primary schools and secondary schools). Intervention School closures and reopenings. Outcome measure Community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (including any measure of community infections rate, hospital admissions or mortality attributed to . Methods On 7 January 2021, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID-19 Research Database, ERIC, the British Education Index, the Australian Education Index and Google, searching title and abstracts for terms related to SARS-CoV-2 AND terms related to schools or non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias In Nonrandomised Studies of Interventions tool to evaluate bias. Results We identified 7474 articles, of which 40 were included, with data from 150 countries. Of these, 32 studies assessed school closures and 11 examined reopenings. There was substantial heterogeneity between school closure studies, with half of the studies at lower risk of bias reporting reduced community transmission by up to 60% and half reporting null findings. The majority (n=3 out of 4) of school reopening studies at lower risk of bias reported no associated increases in transmission. Conclusions School closure studies were at risk of confounding and collinearity from other nonpharmacological interventions implemented around the same time as school closures, and the effectiveness of closures remains uncertain. School reopenings, in areas of low transmission and with appropriate mitigation measures, were generally not accompanied by increasing community transmission. With such varied evidence on effectiveness, and the harmful effects, policymakers should take a measured approach before implementing school closures; and should look to reopen schools in times of low transmission, with appropriate mitigation measures.\n","Score: 9.85843829904399\n","\n","Title: Ebola virus disease in nonendemic countries\n","Abstract: The 2014 West African outbreak of Ebola virus disease was unprecedented in its scale and has resulted in transmissions outside endemic countries.

We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset.\n"," The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period.\n"," The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole.\n"," Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.\n","Score: 17.05745208968605\n","\n","Title: The estimation of SARS incubation distribution from serial interval data using a convolution likelihood\n","Abstract: The incubation period of SARS is the time between infection of disease and onset of symptoms. Knowledge about the distribution of incubation times is crucial in determining the length of quarantine period and is an important parameter in modelling the spread and control of SARS. As the exact time of infection is unknown for most patients, the incubation time cannot be determined. What is observable is the serial interval which is the time from the onset of symptoms in an index case to the onset of symptoms in a subsequent case infected by the index case. By constructing a convolution likelihood based on the serial interval data, we are able to estimate the incubation distribution which is assumed to be Weibull, and justiÿcations are given to support this choice over other distributions. The method is applied to data provided by the Ministry of Health of Singapore and the results justify the choice of a ten-day quarantine period. The indirect estimate obtained using the method of convolution likelihood is validated by means of comparison with a direct estimate obtained directly from a subset of patients for whom the incubation time can be ascertained. Despite its name, the proposed indirect estimate is actually more precise than the direct estimate because serial interval data are recorded for almost all patients, whereas exact incubation times can be determined for only a small subset. It is possible to obtain an even more e cient estimate by using the combined data but the improvement is not substantial.\n","Score: 13.555806044847388\n","\n","Title: Infectivity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome during Its Incubation Period\n","Abstract: Objective To evaluate the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during its incubation period by investigating chains of transmission and individuals isolated for medical observation with a view to providing scientific evidence for updating protocols of medical isolation. Methods Individuals related with the two SARS chains of transmission in Beijing in 2003 and a group of individuals isolated for medical observation in Haidian district of Beijing during the SARS outbreak were selected as subjects of study. Contactors with SARS patients and those with symptom development following the contacts were investigated via questionnaire. Serum samples were collected from super transmitters and tested for SARSCoV antibody by neutralization test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results A total of 1 112 contactors were investigated in three surveys. Of them, 669 had a history of close contact with symptomatic SARS patients, 101 developed symptoms with a rate of 15.1%, 363 had a history of close contact with patients in their incubation period, none of whom developed symptoms (0%). Serum samples were collected from 32 highlyexposed individuals, of whom 13 developing SARS symptoms after contact had serum samples positive for SARSCoV antibody. Samples collected from the asymptomatic contactors were all negative for SARSCoV antibody. Conclusion SARS cases are infectious only during their symptomatic period and are noninfectious during the incubation period. Isolation for medical observation should be placed for individuals who are in close contact with symptomatic SARS patients. The results of our study are of decisive significance for the Ministry of Health to the definition of SARS close contactor.\n","Score: 12.78245807273877\n","\n","Title: Chaos in a nonautonomous eco-epidemiological model with delay\n","Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a nonautonomous predator-prey model with disease in prey, and a discrete time delay for the incubation period in disease transmission. Employing the theory of differential inequalities, we find sufficient conditions for the permanence of the system. Further, we use Lyapunov's functional method to obtain sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability of the system. We observe that the permanence of the system is unaffected due to presence of incubation delay. However, incubation delay affects the global stability of the positive periodic solution of the system. To reinforce the analytical results and to get more insight into the system's behavior, we perform some numerical simulations of the autonomous and nonautonomous systems with and without time delay. We observe that for the gradual increase in the magnitude of incubation delay, the autonomous system develops limit cycle oscillation through a Hopf-bifurcation while the corresponding nonautonomous system shows chaotic dynamics through quasiperiodic oscillations. We apply basic tools of non-linear dynamics such as Poincaré section and maximum Lyapunov exponent to confirm the chaotic behavior of the system.\n","Score: 12.592477717046949\n","\n","Title: EPIDEMIC AND CASE INVESTIGATIONS Surveillance operation for the 141st confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in response to the patient's prior travel to Jeju Island\n","Abstract: The provincial government of Jeju, South Korea, was notified that a 42-year-old man infected with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus had gone sightseeing in Jeju Island. Although the visiting period might be interpreted as the incubation period of MERS, the province decided to conduct active surveillance to prevent a worst-case scenario. Based on the channel of movement of the patient, healthy isolation and active monitoring were conducted for persons who came in contact with the patient. During the active surveillance, none of the 56 persons in self-isolation and 123 persons under active monitoring became infected. This fact supports that MERS is not contagious during the incubation period.\n","Score: 12.136395426890576\n","\n","Title: Title: Duration of viable virus shedding in SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant infection 1 2\n","Abstract: 41 Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection, including incubation period and 42 transmission rates, distinguish this variant from preceding variants.

Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease-as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods.

Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease, as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variability.\n"," The COVID19 pandemic, caused by the novel RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 [1], has resulted in devastating health, economic, and social consequences. In the absence of vaccines and treatments, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies have been adopted to varying degrees around the world. Given the nature of the virus transmission, NPI measures have effectively reduced human contacts-both slowing the pandemic, and minimizing the risk of local outbreaks [2, 3] . The use of drastic NPI strategies in China reportedly reduced the basic reproductive number, R 0 , to a value smaller than 1, strongly curbing the epidemic within a short period of time [3, 4] . On the other hand widespread testing protocols and contact tracing, in e.g., South Korea, significantly controlled spread during the initial phase of the pandemic [5] . In other countries, the implementation of NPI policies has not been as strict [2] , with an optimistic reduction in transmission of roughly a half. To complicate the containment of the disease, early reports of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections have emerged [6, 7] , with estimates of asymptomatic transmission of as much as 85% of all cases, and 55% per person. These predictions have been supported by recent experimental studies [8] and analysis of the existing data [9, 10].\n"," As NPI controls such as quarantine, social distancing and testing are enforced, it is important to understand the impact of early release and relaxation of controls on the affected populations. Recent studies have attempted to address how societies can vary social contacts optimally in time in order to maintain economic activity while controlling epidemics [11] . For instance, preliminary numerical studies suggest that periodic closure to control outbreak risk, where a population oscillates between 30-50 days of strict lockdown followed by 30-50 days of relaxed social restrictions, may efficiently contain the spread of COVID-19 and minimize economic damage [12] . These studies test interesting hypotheses, but cannot be immediately generalized to new emerging diseases. A basic understanding of why and when such risk minimizing strategies are effective remains unclear, and may benefit from a general analytical approach.\n"," As a first step in this direction we analyze SEIR-like models with tunable periodic contact rates. Our methods reveal the existence of a characteristic optimal period of contact-breaking between individuals that minimizes the risk of observing a large outbreak, and predicts exactly how such an optimal period depends on epidemic and social parameters. In particular, we show that the optimal period for closure increases (or decreases) predictably with R 0 and the incubation period of a disease, and exists as long as R 0 is below a predictable threshold, and when there is not a time-scale separation between incubation and recovery. We demonstrate analytically that periodic closure is maximally effective for containing disease outbreaks when the typical incubation and recovery periods for a disease are similar -in such cases suppressing large outbreaks with R 0 's as large as 4. Our results compare well to numerical simulations and are robust to the inclusion of heterogeneous infection and recovery rates, which are known to be important for modeling COVID-19 dynamics.\n"," To begin, we first consider the canonical SEIR model with a time-dependent infectious contact rate parameter, β(t). Individuals in this model are in one of four possible states: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered. Following the simplest mass-action formulation of the disease dynamics, and assuming negligible background births and deaths, the fraction of susceptible (s), exposed (e), infectious (i), and recovered (r) individuals in a population satisfy the following differential equations in time (t), where dots denote time-derivatives:\n"," (1) e = β(t)si − αe,\n"," Such equations are valid in in the limit of large, well-arXiv:2007.16151v1 [q-bio.PE] 31 Jul 2020\n","Score: 11.26698361044212\n","\n","Title: Article 209 X (2020) Clinical Time Features and Chest Imaging of 85 Patients With COVID-19 in Zhuhai\n","Abstract: Background: An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to the entire country. We sought to delineate the time features of clinical symptoms, virological conversion, and chest radiological abnormalities in individuals infected with this virus in Zhuhai, China.\n"," Methods: In this retrospective study, we assessed 85 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, from the 17th of January to the 11th of February 2020. Outcomes were followed up until the 24th of February 2020.\n"," The median age of the 85 patients with COVID-19 was 43 years (range, 1-80); 56.5% (48/85) were female. The median time from the last known contact to the first SARS-CoV-2 positive test result was 8 days (0-18). The time to throat swab negativity for SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 5 to 36 days after illness onset. Patients with abnormal chest imaging findings on admission were older than those with normal imaging findings (median age, 50 [3-80] vs. 37 [1-69], P = 0.031). Among patients with lung changes on admission, the risk of lesions was 13.8 times greater in the left lower lobe than in the right middle lobe. Most lung lesions appeared within 2 weeks of onset (median 4-5 days). The overall rates of lesions in the right upper/middle/lower lobe and left upper/lower lobe were 47.1, 30.6, 62.4% as well as 49.4 and 63.5%, respectively.\n"," The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 may be longer than 14 days; thus, medical surveillance after contact is required for longer than this.

One major concern was whether the overlap of the pandemic and seasonal bronchiolitis would put substantial pressure on healthcare systems. Bronchiolitis has a predictable seasonal pattern, primarily in autumn and winter, and in France, this is between October and February. The second COVID-19 wave in France led to a 2-week night curfew from 17 October 2020, followed by a full lockdown on 30 October. However, day care centres and primary and secondary schools remained open. The aim of this study was to determine the effect on bronchiolitis of the second COVID-19 pandemic wave in France and the public measures introduced to halt infections, namely social distancing, wearing masks, hand hygiene, curfews and lockdowns. It was conducted at one of the largest tertiary university paediatric hospitals in the Paris region, which handles about 55,000 paediatric emergency department (PED) visits a year. We used our electronic health record system to identify all children under the age of 2 years who visited our PED with bronchiolitis. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes J21.0, J21.1, J21.8 and J21.9 were used. We identified the number of infants visiting the PED for bronchiolitis and the number who were hospitalised during the start of the 2020-2021 bronchiolitis epidemic season, from week 41 (early October) to week 52 (end of December). These were compared with the same weeks in 2015 to 2019 using time series analysis. The data were analysed with SPSS, version 18 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research of the Sorbonne University (CER-2020-105).\n"," During the five pre-pandemic seasons, bronchiolitis epidemic curves started to rise in weeks 37-41 and peaked between weeks 47 and 49. During the pandemic season, the curve only rose slightly in week 37 and was nearly flat until week 52 ( Figure S1 ). During the five pre-pandemic seasons, the total number of PED visits for bronchiolitis from the beginning of the epidemic in October (week 41) to its end in February (week 8) was 6,052, with 78.9% of these visits from weeks 41 to 52. Between weeks 41 and 52, the mean and standard deviation weekly number of visits for bronchiolitis were 79.2 ± 38.5 during the pre-pandemic seasons and only 11.6 ± 3.8 during the pandemic season (p = 0.0022). Pandemic season visits for bronchiolitis were 82.1% lower than predicted by the time series analysis which had a R-squared of 0.8 (Figure 1) .

Specifically, uncovering the relationship between epidemic onset and various risk indicators such as socioeconomic, mobility and climate factors can reveal locations and travel patterns that play critical roles in furthering an outbreak. We study the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza outbreaks in Sweden's municipalities between 2009 and 2015 and use the Generalized Inverse Infection Method (GIIM) to assess the most significant contributing risk factors. GIIM represents an epidemic spreading process on a network: nodes correspond to geographical objects, links indicate travel routes, and transmission probabilities assigned to the links guide the infection process. Our results reinforce existing observations that the influenza outbreaks considered in this study were driven by the country's largest population centers, while meteorological factors also contributed significantly. Travel and other socioeconomic indicators have a negligible effect. We also demonstrate that by training our model on the 2009 outbreak, we can predict the epidemic onsets in the following five seasons with high accuracy.\n"," In this paper, we seek to uncover the critical socioeconomic, travel, and meteorological factors behind H1N1 outbreaks in Sweden, covering six years between 2009 and 2015, focusing on the start of the epidemic phase. We aim to identify the relationship between the timing of this event and the above factors available for each of the 290 municipalities of Sweden. We also explore the predictive capabilities of our approach by using the 2009 pandemic to train our model and measuring its performance on data from the following years. We analyze Sweden at a much higher resolution compared with previous studies 13 and extend the potential list of risk factors.\n"," We analyze disease spreading dynamics with the Generalized Inverse Infection Model (GIIM) 19,20,23 , a network-based optimization method. In this model, each municipality is a node, and the edges between nodes represent possible disease spreading paths. The primary output of this model is the set of estimated transmission probabilities between the nodes (geographical areas) of the model. These probabilities can be formalized as a function of known attributes: properties of the nodes (municipalities) and edges (pairs of municipalities) of the network. We estimate the parameters of this function with the Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization Method 21 . GIIM can be used with any monotonic infection model, including members of the SEIR family 20,22 . Since our goal is to estimate the timing of the epidemic onset, we select the SI infection model 22 to represent spreading dynamics. The SI model has been used in literature when modeling the first occurrence of a disease and spreading dynamics during the early phase of an outbreak 23,24 . The epidemic onset falls into the latter category.\n"," We use GIIM to estimate the transmission risk between geographical areas, the importation and exportation risks for all municipalities, and to establish the relationship between the properties of the outbreak and several socioeconomic, travel and meteorological indicators. In addition, we can use the risk factors, their assigned weights, and the attribute function to simulate an outbreak during any given time period, allowing us to predict the timing of the epidemic onset in future seasons. We demonstrate this by training our model on data from the 2009 pandemic and predicting the timing of the onset in later seasons with good accuracy.\n","Score: 9.742389246364823\n","\n","Title: Clinical Infectious Diseases Antibody Responses to Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 Virus After Pandemic and Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in Healthcare Workers: A 5-Year Follow-up Study\n","Abstract: Background. The 2009 influenza pandemic was caused by the A/H1N1pdm09 virus, which was subsequently included in the seasonal vaccine, up to 2016/2017, as the A/H1N1 strain. This provided a unique opportunity to investigate the antibody response to H1N1pdm09 over time.\n"," Methods. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were immunized with the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine in 2009 (N = 250), and subsequently vaccinated with seasonal vaccines containing H1N1pdm09 for 4 seasons (repeated group), <4 seasons (occasional group), or no seasons (single group). Blood samples were collected pre and at 21 days and 3, 6, and 12 months after each vaccination, or annually (pre-season) from 2010 in the single group. The H1N1pdm09-specific antibodies were measured by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay.\n"," Results. Pandemic vaccination robustly induced HI antibodies that persisted above the 50% protective threshold (HI titers ≥ 40) over 12 months post-vaccination. Previous seasonal vaccination and the duration of adverse events after the pandemic vaccination influenced the decision to vaccinate in subsequent seasons. During 2010During /2011During -2013During /2014, antibodies were boosted after each seasonal vaccination, although no significant difference was observed between the repeated and occasional groups. In the single group without seasonal vaccination, 32% of HCWs seroconverted (≥4-fold increase in HI titers) during the 4 subsequent years, most of whom had HI titers <40 prior to seroconversion. When excluding these seroconverted HCWs, HI titers gradually declined from 12 to 60 months post-pandemic vaccination.\n"," Conclusions. Pandemic vaccination elicited durable antibodies, supporting the incorporation of adjuvant. Our findings support the current recommendation of annual influenza vaccination in HCWs.\n"," Clinical Trials Registration.

complex and dynamic environment, which hosts microorganisms including archaea, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses. These microorganisms interact with each other, altering the ruminal environment and substrates that will be available for the host digestion and metabolism. Viruses can infect the host and other microorganisms, which can drive changes in microorganisms' lysis rate, substrate availability, nutrient recycling, and population structure. The lysis of ruminal microorganisms' cells by viruses can release enzymes that enhance feedstuff fermentation, which may increase dietary nutrient utilization and feed efficiency. However, negative effects associated to viruses in the gastrointestinal tract have also been reported, in some cases, disrupting the dynamic stability of the ruminal microbiome, which can result in gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Therefore, the objective of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on ruminal virome, their interaction with other components of the microbiome and the effects on animal nutrition.

Physical-chemical parameters of the ruminal environment, such as pH, concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA), ammonia, and other chemical components, can be modulated by the animal's diet. We hypothesized that such changes in the physical-chemical parameters of the ruminal environment can modify the infectivity of viral particles and change the lysis rate of microbial cells, consequently, changes on VFA production and microbial biomass could affect animals' performance.\n"," Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org\n","Score: 9.503000251035653\n","\n","Title: Horses as a Crucial Part of One Health\n","Abstract: One Health (OH) is a crucial concept, where the interference between humans, animals and the environment matters. This review article focusses on the role of horses in maintaining the health of humans and the environment. Horses' impact on environmental health includes their influence on soil and the biodiversity of animal and plant species. Nevertheless, the effect of horses is not usually linear and several factors like plant-animal coevolutionary history, climate and animal density play significant roles. The long history of the relationship between horses and humans is shaped by the service of horses in wars or even in mines. Moreover, horses were essential in developing the first antidote to cure diphtheria. Nowadays, horses do have an influential role in animal assisted therapy, in supporting livelihoods in low income countries and as a leisure partner. Horses are of relevance in the spillover of zoonotic and emerging diseases from wildlife to human (e.g., Hendra Virus), and in non-communicable diseases (e.g., post-traumatic osteoarthritis in horses and back pain in horse riders). Furthermore, many risk factors-such as climate change and antimicrobial resistance-threaten the health of both horses and humans. Finally, the horse is a valuable factor in sustaining the health of humans and the environment, and must be incorporated in any roadmap to achieve OH.\n"," Vet.

To mitigate and adapt to the effects of such threats, governments around the world need significant financial resources. Accordingly, this study focuses on which factors are associated with individuals' support for taxation to protect the environment and pays special attention to the direct effects of civic morality and political trust, as well as their joint effects on support for environmental taxation. Ordered probit results with a sample size of 760 demonstrate that civic morality is positively associated with individuals' support for environmental taxation; political trust works in the same way. More importantly, political trust moderates and enhances the linkage between civic morality and support for environmental taxation, demonstrating that it can serve as a powerful tool in a government's efforts to protect the environment.\n","Score: 8.958693893476353\n","\n","Title: Comprehensive codon usage analysis of porcine deltacoronavirus\n","Abstract: Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly identified coronavirus of pigs that was first reported in Hong Kong in 2012. Since then, many PDCoV isolates have been identified worldwide. In this study, we analyzed the codon usage pattern of the S gene using complete coding sequences and complete PDCoV genomes to gain a deeper understanding of their genetic relationships and evolutionary history. We found that during evolution three groups evolved with a relatively low codon usage bias (effective number of codons (ENC) of 52). The factors driving bias were complex. However, the primary element influencing the codon bias of PDCoVs was natural selection. Our results revealed that different natural environments may have a significant impact on the genetic characteristics of the strains. In the future, more epidemiological surveys are required to examine the factors that resulted in the emergence and outbreak of this virus.\n","Score: 8.904801858553185\n","\n","Title: Daily Stress and Behavioral Problems in Chinese Children: The Moderating Roles of Family Functioning and the Classroom Environment\n","Abstract: Grounded in the stress-coping model, our study examined family functioning and the classroom environment as protective factors in the relationship between daily stress and behavioral problems in Chinese children. The participants were 1,450 children (51.7% male, M age = 10.91 years, SD = 0.96) in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades at five schools. The children completed the questionnaires measuring daily stress, family functioning, and the classroom environment. Additionally, their parents rated their behavioral problems. The latent moderated structural (LMS) equation approach was used to test moderator effects. After controlling for sex and grade, our results indicate that daily stress positively predicted the children's behavioral problems. Both family functioning and the classroom environment moderated the relationship between daily stress and behavioral problems. Further assessment of latent interaction effects indicate that buffering effects on behavioral problems were most prominent in conditions involving low stress. In sum, families and schools should not ignore children's minor stressors, as interventions involving family functioning and favorable classroom environments may help to reduce behavioral problems in children who report low levels of daily stress.\n","Score: 8.902785269098963\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic in the context of the human and the environment\n","Abstract: From 2019, life in the world has mainly been determined by successive waves of the COVID-19 epidemic. During this time, the virus structure, action, short-and long-term effects of the infection were discovered, and treatments were developed. This epidemic undoubtedly affected people's lives, but increasing attention is also being paid to the effects of the epidemic on the environment. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, a global scoping review of peer-reviewed information has been conducted on the use of over-the-counter non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs in the treatment of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their positive and negative effects on the human body, the effects of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on aquatic organisms, and their adverse effects on non-target organisms. The literature from 1998-2021 was analysed using the Scopus®, Web of Science™ (WoS) and Google Scholar databases. As non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs place a heavy burden on the environment, all reports of the presence of these drugs in the environment during the pandemic period have been thoroughly analysed. Of the 70 peerreviewed records within the scope, only 14% (n=10) focussed on the analysis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs concentrations in wastewater and surface waters during the pandemic period.

Moreover, the device effectively captured airborne transmitted calicivirus, rotavirus and influenza virus, with recovery rates up to 21% after 40 min in a 19 m 3 room. The ionizer generates negative ions, rendering airborne particles/ aerosol droplets negatively charged and electrostatically attracts them to a positively charged collector plate. Trapped viruses are then identified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR. The device enables unique possibilities for rapid and simple removal of virus from air and offers possibilities to simultaneously identify and prevent airborne transmission of viruses.\n"," There is an urgent need for simple, portable and sensitive devices to collect, eliminate and identify viruses from air, to rapidly detect and prevent outbreaks and spread of infectious diseases 1 . Each year, infectious diseases cause millions of deaths around the world and many of the most common infectious pathogens are spread by droplets or aerosols caused by cough, sneeze, vomiting etc. 2-5 . Knowledge of aerosol transmission mechanisms are limited for most pathogens, although spread by air is an important transmission route for many pathogens including viruses 6 .\n"," Today no simple validated technology exists which can rapidly and easily collect viruses from air and identify them. The problem is not the analyzing technique, since molecular biological methods such as real-time PCR enable a sensitive detection system of most pathogens 7-9 . The difficulty is to develop an effective sampling method to rapidly collect small airborne particles including viruses from large volumes of air. Furthermore, the sampling method should be robust with easy handling to enable a wide distribution and application in many types of environment. At present, the most commonly used techniques aimed to collect pathogens from air are airflow and liquid models 10-15 . These systems are complex, and their efficiency has not been thoroughly evaluated.\n"," Spread of infectious diseases in hospitals can be most significant [16] [17] [18] . In many situations there is a need for a pathogen-and particle-free environment, e.g. in operation wards, environments for immunosuppressed patients as well as for patients with serious allergies. This makes it desirable to have a method not only for collection and identification 19 , but also for eliminating virus and other pathogens from air 20 . Ozone gas has been shown to inactivate norovirus and may be used in empty rooms to decontaminate surfaces, however in rooms with patients ozone should not been used due to its toxicity 21 . Generation of negative ions has previously been shown to reduce transmission of Newcastle disease virus 22,23 and several kind of bacteria 24,25 in animal experimental set-ups.\n"," The ionizing device used in this study operates at 12 V and generates negative ionizations in an electric field, which collide with and charge the aerosol particles. Those are then captured by a positively charged collector plate. For safety reasons, the collector plate has a very low current, less than 80μ A, however the ionizer accelerates a voltage of more than 200,000 eV, which enables high production of several billion electrons per second. Moreover, this device does not produce detectable levels of ozone and can thus be safely used in all environments.\n"," This technique is known to effectively collect and eliminate cat-allergens from air 26 . Aerosolized rotavirus, calicivirus and influenza virus particles exposed to the ionizing device were attracted to the collector plate and subsequently identified by electron microscopy and reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR techniques. Most importantly, we demonstrate that this technology can be used to prevent airborne-transmitted influenza virus infections.\n","Score: 8.142098089279813\n","\n","Title: Environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan\n","Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused high number of infections and deaths of healthcare workers globally. Distribution and possible transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital environment should be clarified. We herein collected 431 environmental (391 surface and 40 air) samples in the intensive care unit (ICU) and general wards (GWs) of three hospitals in Wuhan, China from February 21 to March 4, 2020, and detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time quantitative PCR. The viral positive rate in the contaminated areas was 17.8% (28/157), whereas there was no virus detected in the clean areas. Higher positive rate (22/59, 37.3%) was found in ICU than that in GWs (3/63, 4.8%). The surfaces of computer keyboards and mouse in the ICU were the most contaminated (8/10, 80.0%), followed by the ground (6/9, 66.7%) and outer glove (2/5, 40.0%).

2019-nCoV spread and their disinfection with biocidal agents\n","Abstract: The WHO has declared COVID-19 illness a global health concern which is caused by 2019-nCoV, causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Transmissibility among individual to individual have been reported through droplets and probably also via contaminated surfaces and hands. Human coronaviruses can persist on inanimate surfaces such as plastic, glass, fibers and metals up to nine days. 2019-nCoV remains infectious in air for 3 h and on inanimate surfaces such as cardboard, copper, plastic and steel up to 24, 4, 72 and 48 h respectively. Disinfectant activity of various biocidal agents against coronaviruses like ethanol (62-71%), sodium hypochlorite (0.1%) and hydrogen peroxide (0.5%) can be regarded effective against 2019-nCoV as well. As no vaccine and antiviral therapies have been discovered for 2019-nCoV, prevention of further spread will viable option to control the ongoing and future outbreaks.\n","Score: 25.265125899500628\n","\n","Title: Survival of Enveloped and Non-Enveloped Viruses on Inanimate Surfaces\n","Abstract: In the present study, we evaluated the viability of non-enveloped viruses, minute virus of mice (MVM) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), and enveloped-viruses, influenza A virus (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), on surfaces. We also investigated the impact of the initial concentration of proteins and sodium chloride on the persistence of infectious CVB4 on surfaces. Viral suspensions (>10 4.5 TCID 50 ) were applied to petri dish lids and dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet. The recovered viral preparations were titered on appropriate cell lines. Enveloped viruses persisted for less than 5 days while CVB4 and MVM persisted for weeks. However, repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension had a stronger virucidal effect on CVB4 than on H1N1 and HSV-1. These repetitive cycles had no effect on the infectious titer of MVM. When exposed to drying, the initial concentrations of bovine serum albumin (from 0 to 90 mg mL −1 ), fetal calf serum (from 0 to 100%), and sodium chloride (from 0 to 300 mg mL −1 ) affected the viability of CVB4. CVB4 was more likely to be inactivated by drying in a protein-rich medium, whereas the impact of drying was reduced in the presence of sodium chloride. The results of the present study demonstrated that the resistance of viruses to drying, as suggested by iterative drying, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral subpopulations, but was influenced by media compositions and component concentrations, as illustrated in the model of CVB4.\n","Score: 23.110562379735043\n","\n","Title: Photodynamic Antimicrobial Polymers for Infection Control\n","Abstract: Hospital-acquired infections pose both a major risk to patient wellbeing and an economic burden on global healthcare systems, with the problem compounded by the emergence of multidrug resistant and biocide tolerant bacterial pathogens. Many inanimate surfaces can act as a reservoir for infection, and adequate disinfection is difficult to achieve and requires direct intervention. In this study we demonstrate the preparation and performance of materials with inherent photodynamic, surface-active, persistent antimicrobial properties through the incorporation of photosensitizers into high density poly(ethylene) (HDPE) using hot-melt extrusion, which require no external intervention except a source of visible light. Our aim is to prevent bacterial adherence to these surfaces and eliminate them as reservoirs of nosocomial pathogens, thus presenting a valuable advance in infection control. A two-layer system with one layer comprising photosensitizerincorporated HDPE, and one layer comprising HDPE alone is also described to demonstrate the versatility of our approach. The photosensitizer-incorporated materials are capable of reducing the adherence of viable bacteria by up to 3.62 Log colony forming units (CFU) per square centimeter of material surface for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and by up to 1.51 Log CFU/cm 2 for Escherichia coli. Potential applications for the technology are in antimicrobial coatings for, or materials comprising objects, such as tubing, collection bags, handrails, finger-plates on hospital doors, or medical equipment found in the healthcare setting.\n","Score: 16.8863848142674\n","\n","Title: Citation: Mordecai GJ and Hewson I (2020) Coronaviruses in the Sea\n","Abstract: Interest in coronaviruses because of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has generated concern about their occurrence and persistence in aquatic habitats. Coronaviruses are not quantitatively significant constituents of marine virioplankton. Members of the Nidovirales (to which human coronaviruses belong) infect marine mammals, teleosts and possibly invertebrates, and human coronaviruses may persist in marine plankton receiving wastewater effluent. However, virions likely experience significant particle and infectivity decay rates in surface seawater, similar to other enveloped RNA viruses.\n","Score: 12.956620535076341\n","\n","Title: Aptamer Conjugated Gold Nanostar-Based Distance-Dependent Nanoparticle Surface Energy Transfer Spectroscopy for Ultrasensitive Detection and Inactivation of Corona Virus\n","Abstract: The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus infection has killed more than 2 million people. Herein, we demonstrate that Rhodamine 6G (Rh-6G) dye conjugated DNA aptamer-attached gold nanostar (GNS)-based distance-dependent nanoparticle surface energy transfer (NSET) spectroscopy has the capability of rapid diagnosis of specific SARS-CoV-2 spike recombinant antigen or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus within 10 min. Because Rh-6G-attached single-stand DNA aptamer wrapped the GNS, 99% dye fluorescence was quenched because of the NSET process. In the presence of spike antigen or virus, the fluorescence signal persists because of the aptamer−spike protein binding. Specifically, the limit of detection for the NSET assay has been determined to be 130 fg/mL for antigen and 8 particles/mL for virus. Finally, we have demonstrated that DNA aptamer-attached GNSs can stop virus infection by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding capability and destroying the lipid membrane of the virus.\n","Score: 12.671571526090178\n","\n","Title: Short-term inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by hydrogen peroxide in persistent nasopharyngeal carriers\n","Abstract: Asymptomatic and convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) subjects may carry severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for months in their upper respiratory ways.

This review summarizes recent literature on fomite contamination and microbial survival in the built environment, transmission between fomites and humans, and implications for human health. Recent Findings Applications of molecular sequencing techniques to analyze microbial samples have increased our understanding of the microbial diversity that exists in the built environment. This growing body of research has established that microbial communities on surfaces include substantial diversity, with considerable dynamics. While many microbial taxa likely die or lay dormant, some organisms survive, including those that are potentially beneficial, benign, or pathogenic. Surface characteristics also influence microbial survival and rates of transfer to and from humans. Recent research has combined experimental data, mechanistic modeling, and epidemiological approaches to shed light on the likely contributors to microbial exchange between fomites and humans and their contributions to adverse (and even potentially beneficial) human health outcomes. Summary In addition to concerns for fomite transmission of potential pathogens, new analytical tools have uncovered other microbial matters that can be transmitted indirectly via fomites, including entire microbial communities and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Mathematical models and epidemiological approaches can provide insight on human health implications. However, both are subject to limitations associated with study design, and there is a need to better understand appropriate input model parameters. Fomites remain an important mechanism of transmission of many microbes, along with direct contact and short-and long-range aerosols.\n","Score: 11.401782127450854\n","\n","Title: Persistence against benzalkonium chloride promotes rapid evolution of tolerance during periodic disinfection\n","Abstract: Biocides used as disinfectants are important to prevent the transmission of pathogens, especially during the current antibiotic resistance crisis. This crisis is exacerbated by phenotypically tolerant persister subpopulations that can survive transient antibiotic treatment and facilitate resistance evolution. Here, we show that E. coli displays persistence against a widely used disinfectant, benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Periodic, persister-mediated failure of disinfection rapidly selects for BAC tolerance, which is associated with reduced cell surface charge and mutations in the lpxM locus, encoding an enzyme for lipid A biosynthesis. Moreover, the fitness cost incurred by BAC tolerance turns into a fitness benefit in the presence of antibiotics, suggesting a selective advantage of BAC-tolerant mutants in antibiotic environments. Our findings highlight the links between persistence to disinfectants and resistance evolution to antimicrobials.\n","Score: 11.234049649272496\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof Surface Chemistry Can Unlock Drivers of Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in Variety of Environmental Conditions Surface Chemistry Can Unlock Drivers of Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in Variety of Environmental Conditions\n","Abstract: The surface stability and resulting transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, specifically in indoor environments, have been identified as a potential pandemic challenge requiring investigation. This novel virus can be found on various surfaces in contaminated sites such as clinical places, however, the behaviour and molecular interactions of the virus with respect to the surfaces are poorly understood. Regarding this, the virus adsorption onto solid surfaces can play a critical role in transmission and survival in various environments. In this article, firstly an overview of existing knowledge concerning viral spread, molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2, and the virus surface stability is presented. Then, we highlight potential drivers of the SARS-CoV-2 surface adsorption and stability in various environmental conditions. This theoretical analysis shows that different surface and environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, and pH are crucial considerations in building fundamental understanding of the virus transmission and thereby improving safety practices.\n"," Coronavirus genomes are comparatively large for RNA viruses and SARS-CoV-2 encodes an extensive complement of non-structural proteins (e.g. 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CL) protease, papainlike protease, etc.) as well as structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein 1 .

Proliferation of virulent and deadly SARS-CoV-2 variants require effective transmission mitigation strategies. Under reasonable environmental conditions, culturable and infectious SARS-CoV-2 can survive on contaminated fomites from hours to months. In the present study we evaluated a surface-anchored polymeric quaternary ammonium antimicrobial to help reduce fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from contaminated surfaces.\n"," Two studies were performed on antimicrobial pre-treated metal disks in March 2020 by two independent Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) equipped laboratories in April 2020. These facilities were in Belgium (the Rega Medical Research Institute) and Australia (the Peter Doherty Institute) and independently applied quantitative carrierbased methodologies using the authentic SARS-CoV-2 isolates (hCoV-19/Australia/VIC01/2020, hCoV-19/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020).\n"," Residual dry tests were independently conducted at both facilities and demonstrated sustained virion destruction (10 8.23 TCID 50 /carrier GHB-03021 isolate, and 10 3.66 TCID 50 /carrier VIC01 isolate) 1 hour (drying) + 10 minutes after inoculation. Reductions are further supported by degradation of RNA on antimicrobial-treated surfaces using qRT-PCR.\n"," Conclusions: Using a polymeric quaternary ammonium antimicrobial (EPA/PMRA registered) the results independently support a sustained antiviral effect via SARS-CoV-2 virion destruction and viral RNA degradation. This indicates that silane-anchored quaternary ammonium compound (SiQAC-18) treated surfaces could play an important role in mitigating the communicability and fomite transmission of
