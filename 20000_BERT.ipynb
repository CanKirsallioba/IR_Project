            "Body Text:\n",
            " A vaccine, providing active and protective immunity against a target disease, contains an agent that originated from and/or resembles a disease-causing microorganism. It is often made from a weakened or inactivated microbe, its toxins, or one of its nucleotides, peptides or proteins. Vaccines can be prophylactic to ameliorate or better prevent the effects of a wild-type pathogen, or therapeutic against likely cancers. To date, the World Health Organization lists twenty-seven preventable infections for which vaccines are available [1] -far less than what our society needs.\n",
            " Vaccination, a process of introducing foreign antigenic material(s) in order to activate a host immune system, has been a key strategy to control diseases and improve quality of life in humans and animals. Despite the presence of some successful vaccines, many novel and modified diseases including Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, coronavirus diseases [middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)], dengue fever, Marburg disease, malaria, and tuberculosis are in need of effective vaccines together with qualified adjuvants. While traditional adjuvants such as alum have been exclusively employed clinically to promote humoral responses, recent developments in adjuvant research have identified molecules, which are pathogen-associated molecular patterns, a few chemical compounds, and agonists of toll-like receptors, all of which induce strong immune responses.\n",
            " With great advancements in the area of material science, a new era of innovative strategies for vaccine design has arrived, enabling the precise delivery of vaccines, the enhanced role of vaccine adjuvants, an increase in the sparing effect, better stabilization, and slow release at the induction site. Nanomaterials that modified to trigger antigen-specific immune responses could be categorized into liposomes and lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, virus-like particles, self-assembled proteins, and carbon-based nanoparticles (carbon nanotubes and graphenes). In the Special Issue, entitled 'Nanoparticles to Improve the Efficacy of Vaccine' in the Pharmaceutics (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics/special_ issues/Nanoparticles_Vaccines), we draw attention to the advanced platforms and technologies using nanomaterials in order to produce the best outcomes in terms of vaccination and immunological memory.\n",
            " Kim et al. [2] described a method to improve the battle against intracellular bacterial or viral infections, and malignant tumors by various vaccination schemes, using physicochemical characteristics that target antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In particular, the improvement of an unconventional type of antigen presentation, called 'cross-presentation' in APCs when treated with certain nanomaterials for antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses, was discussed [3] . The authors focused on the mechanisms of two major intracellular pathways that nano-sized vaccines harness for cross-presentation, namely endosomal swelling and rupture, and membrane fusion. These processes allow exogenous antigens exported from phagosomes into the cytosol, followed by loading on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, triggering the clonal expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.\n",
            " Barnowski et al. [4] discussed nano-vaccines in the form of virus-like particles (VLPs), which share structural identities with their wild-type viruses, allowing B cells to face the natural conformation of the virus. The authors concentrated on the use of flagellin, a potent inducer of innate immunity via toll-like receptor 5, as an adjuvant to formulate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based nanoparticle B cell-targeting vaccines that display either the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) or a model antigen, hen egg lysozyme (HEL). They postulated that, in the context of VLP-based B cell nano-vaccines, flagellin may outcompete against a less immunogenic antigen, while, in combination with a strong immunogen, the adjuvanticity of flagellin dominates over its immunogenicity.\n",
            " Kang et al. [5] introduced a VLP vaccine containing Rhoptry organelle proteins (ROP)4 and/or ROP13 secreted by Toxoplasma gondii together with influenza M1. It was intriguing that upon challenge via the oral route, mice immunized with ROP(4 + 13) VLPs elicited higher levels of T. gondii-specific IgG and IgA responses in fecal, urine, intestine and vaginal samples in accordance with CD4+ T, CD8+ T cells, and germinal center B cell responses when compared with other vaccines, ROP4 VLPs, ROP13 VLPs, and ROP4+ROP13 VLPs. Thus, the article shed light on important insights and potential strategies for the design of a vaccine using the T. gondii ROPs and VLP system.\n",
            " Viyayan et al. [6] discussed biomimetic nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver vaccines for the treatment of diseases including HIV, malaria, some tumors and bacterial diseases due to their beneficial advantages such as improved antigen stability, targeted delivery, long-time controlled release and evasion of immune responses. They covered four kinds of biomimetic NPs for the delivery of vaccines. The first was liposomes, obtained by the dispersion of phospholipids in water, because they display high antigen loading and co-delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic antigens. The second was NPs coated with cell membranes from red blood cells, leukocytes, cytotoxic T-cells, NK cells, platelets, macrophages or cancer cells, because they preserve the physicochemical properties of the core synthetic NPs and maintain the cellular composition on their membrane shell. The third was self-assembled proteins, because they play diverse physiological roles and mimic natural microbe architectures. The fourth was virus-like NPs containing noninfectious subsets of viruses, because they assemble without containing any viral RNA.\n",
            " Sartorius et al. [7] described the possibility of filamentous bacteriophages (FBs), prepared by phage display technology, as nature-made NPs to deliver therapeutic vaccines, because lytic bacteriophages have been used as antibacterial materials in several clinical trials due to their safe and inexpensive therapeutic behavior, where the FBs enter the blood vessels easily, owing to their nano size, and exhibit high-density antigen expression. The authors showed the induction of specific cytotoxic T cell responses to HLA-A2-restricted and hepatitis B virus epitopes due to the ability of the filamentous rod, internalized into APCs. It seems likely that the targeted delivery of these NPs in new-generation vaccines against tumors such as melanoma and mastocytoma might be realized, although clinical trials are necessary to establish their safety in humans.\n",
            " Lim et al. [8] described nano delivery systems for the improvement of the enhanced gene expression of DNA vaccines that provide potent humoral and cell-mediated responses. They pointed out the limitations of their clinical applications, which present hurdles in their delivery to targeted immune cells, although none have been approved for clinical use thus far. The authors discussed the advantages and weaknesses of polymeric NPs, lipid NPs, hybrid lipid-polymer NPs, inorganic NPs, virus-like NPs and protein-based NPs in the delivery of DNA vaccines. DNA vaccine platform technology would have a high chance to be successful in clinical application if the better adjuvants and/or the encoded antigens were selected properly.\n",
            " Tan et al. [9] discussed norovirus capsid protein-derived NPs and polymers obtained by homotypically and/or heterotypically self-assembled mechanisms through bioengineering norovirus capsid shell (S) and protruding (P) domains, making them efficient vaccine candidates against noroviruses because they are easily produced, highly stable, they elicit strong host immune responses and several chimeric S 60 and P 24 NPs as well as P domain-derived polymers, as shown in other virus vaccine candidates such as rotavirus, influenza virus, EV 71, HIV-1, Alzheimer, and astrovirus diseases. It may be expected that P 24 NPs and polymers function as multifunctional P domain-based oligomer vaccine platforms displaying foreign antigens.\n",
            " There are two articles describing the importance of adjuvants. Park et al. [10] described a novel adjuvant in the form of a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) nano-structure that can stimulate both Th1 and Th2 responses. The authors claimed that neither adverse side effects such as hematological and serum biochemical parameters, nor IgE and anti-nuclear antibodies, which are markers of autoimmune disease, was found, and postulated that this ssRNA nanostructure may be an alternative choice over traditional adjuvants. Sharma et al. [11] discussed the possibility of zinc oxide (ZnO)-based nanocomposites as vaccine adjuvants and the application of cancer immunotherapeutics because of their biocompatibility, unique physicochemical properties, cost-effective mass production, intrinsic adjuvant-like properties and immunomodulatory function. The authors introduced the effects of diverse formulations and compositions on the efficiency of antigen delivery and immunogenicity by augmenting antigen processing, enhancing antigen stability and controlling the release of antigens. They described that the immunomodulatory effects of these innate immune cells were mediated by intracellular Zn 2+ dissolution in the lysosomes after the phagocytosis of particles and the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines and the activation of immune cells. Furthermore, they discussed the possibility of the enhancement of anti-cancer immunity when combined with tumor-specific antigens into ZnO NPs, although the potential toxicity and biodistribution of the ZnO NPs during in vivo studies should be thoroughly verified.\n",
            " As vaccine development pushes toward less immunogenic components such as nucleotide-based, peptide-based or sub-unit vaccines because of their side effects and the life-threatening risks of live attenuated vaccines, strategies to boost both innate and adaptive immune responses are increasingly needed. In the present Special Issue, the authors discuss the modification of nanomaterials to provide a functional and stable interface for different applications and strategies for vaccination. We hope this Special Issue, highlighting the importance and use of nanomaterials as a platform technology, will direct scientists as well as manufacturers to improve the efficacy of vaccines that are currently under development against modified or novel diseases.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Enormous progress has been made in the development of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Within 1 year after the emergence of this novel infection that caused a global pandemic, vaccine targets were identified, vaccine constructs were created, and phase 1 through phase 3 testing was conducted. Interim results from several large-scale phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated high vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, very little is known about VE against possibly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",
            " It is critically important to assess VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection because reducing infection and community transmission is the key to halting the pandemic. Fortunately, most phase 3 trials have collected blood samples that can be used to identify SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion [1] [2] [3] [4] . For economic and logistical reasons, however, blood samples can only be drawn infrequently, such that seroconversion is only known to occur between two clinic visits that are weeks or months apart. It is more difficult to analyze such interval-censored seroconversion data than potentially right-censored symptomatic disease data, especially when VE changes over time. (An event time is said to be interval-censored if it is only known to lie in a time interval; an event time is said to be potentially right-censored if it is either observed exactly or known to be longer than the duration of follow-up [5] .) Additional challenges arise when community transmission varies over time and when participants are vaccinated on different dates because of either staggered enrollment of participants or crossover of placebo participants to the vaccine arm before the end of the trial. SARS-CoV-2 infection is commonly diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasal swabs. Most phase 3 trials have collected nasal swabs at the enrollment and crossover visits [1] [2] 4] . However, such infrequent swab samples will miss many infections, because a person may be RT-PCR positive for only a few days or weeks after infection [6] . Some phase 3 trials have taken nasal swabs more frequently (e.g., twice a week) on a subset of participants, and the newly launched Prevent COVID U study takes nasal swabs every day; however, frequent RT-PCR testing increases trial cost. How does the RT-PCR testing schedule affect the estimation of VE against infection (defined as viral RNA above a minimum threshold)?\n",
            " In this article, we show how to evaluate potentially waning VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection -defined by seroconversion or detectable viral RNA -using blood or nasal samples taken at varying levels of frequency under the conditions of time-varying community transmission, staggered enrollment of participants, and possible crossover of placebo volunteers to the vaccine arm before the end of the study. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies mimicking the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial [1] and the Prevent COVID U study. In addition, we investigate how the frequency of diagnostic tests and the characteristics (blinded versus unblinded, priority-dependent versus priority-independent) of crossover affect the precision of VE estimation. Figure 1 shows the blood sampling schedules for several phase 3 vaccine trials. For the three vaccines that have received FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), blood samples are also taken at the crossover visits [1] [2] 4] .\n",
            " We are interested in time to SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed by seroconversion, which is only known to occur between two blood draws and is thus interval-censored. We allow the risk of infection to vary over the calendar time and to depend on baseline risk factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, race, occupation, and health conditions; we allow the effect of vaccine on infection to depend on the time elapsed since vaccination.\n",
            " We consider three measures of VE as a function of time elapsed since vaccination: (1) VE h (t) is the percentage reduction in the hazard rate or instantaneous risk of infection at time t; (2) VE a (t) is the percentage reduction in the attack rate or cumulative incidence of infection over the time period (0, t]; and (3) VE a (t 1 , t 2 ) is the percentage reduction in the attack rate over the time period (t 1 , t 2 ]. Note that VE h (t) and VE a (t) pertain to instantaneous and cumulative vaccine effects, respectively, and that VE a (t) is a special case of 4 All rights reserved.

If the vaccine effect is constant over time, then the three VE measures are equivalent (provided that the infection rate is low) [7] .\n",
            " In Supplementary Appendix 1, we formulate the above ideas through an adaptation of the well-known Cox [8] regression model, in which each participant's time to infection is measured from the start of the clinical trial, and the hazard ratio of infection for vaccine versus placebo depends on the time elapsed since vaccination. Because of staggered enrollment and staggered crossover, the serum sampling time points are scattered randomly over time, providing valuable information about the distribution of the infection time. We express VE h and VE a as appropriate functions of the time-varying hazard ratio. We derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the time-varying hazard ratio based on the interval-censored infection time data and provide the corresponding estimators of VE h and VE a .\n",
            " The above framework also applies to RT-PCR tests of nasal swabs. Because an infected person is RT-PCR positive for a shorter period of time than they are seropositive (days/weeks versus months) [6, [9] [10] , nasal swabbing needs to be done more frequently than serum sampling in order to capture the infections defined by detectable viral RNA. With very frequent RT-PCR, time to detectable viral RNA may be treated as a potentially right-censored event time. In our framework, potentially right-censored data is a special case of interval-censored data, with the exactly observed event time lying within an interval of one day.\n",
            " We conducted a series of simulation studies mimicking the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial [1] (Supplementary Appendix 2.1). We used a total of 40,000 participants who enter the trial at a constant rate over a 4-month period and are randomly assigned to vaccine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. To reflect the increase of COVID-19 cases since last summer and the downward trend this spring, we let the risk of infection increase over the first 7 months and decrease afterward. In addition, we let the risk of infection depend strongly on priority tier.\n",
            " As in the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial [1] , the vaccine in our simulation received an EUA from FDA at the 5th month, after which placebo participants are sequentially crossed over 5 to the vaccine arm. We considered:\n",
            " Priority-dependent crossover. Crossover starts at month 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 of the study for participants with priority tier of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, respectively, each participant's waiting time for the clinic visit following the exponential distribution with mean of 0.5 month.\n",
            " Priority-independent crossover. Crossover starts at month 6 of the study for all participants, with the waiting time following the exponential distribution with mean of 0.5 month.\n",
            " Note that crossover spreads over a longer time period under priority-dependent crossover than under priority-independent crossover.\n",
            " We considered both blinded and unblinded crossover. At blinded crossover, placebo participants receive the vaccine and vaccine participants receive the placebo; none of them are aware of the order of their treatments. At unblinded crossover, participants are notified of their original treatment assignments, and placebo recipients are vaccinated. In both types of crossover, all participants are followed until the time of analysis, which is 10.5 months since trial initiation. To avoid bias due to behavioral confounding, we discarded the data collected after unblinded crossover.\n",
            " As shown in Figure 1 , blood samples were scheduled to be drawn on Day 1, Day 22, Day 52 and Day 209 (during the first year) in the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial [1] . In our simulation, we allowed for small random deviations from the schedule. Blood samples were also drawn at the crossover visits. Because of staggered enrollment and staggered crossover, serum sampling points were scattered randomly over the study period, making it possible to estimate time-varying VE.\n",
            " We also simulated a design under which there is no crossover before the time of analysis.\n",
            " Without crossover, placebo participants stay on placebo longer than with crossover, providing more information about long-term placebo-controlled VE. However, because crossover is one of the serum sampling points, there are fewer sampling points and thus fewer antibody tests under no crossover than under crossover.\n",

We refer to these two situations as constant VE and waning VE, respectively. (Note that constant versus waning VE pertains only to the period after the first 4 weeks, when VE is ramping up.)\n",
            " In our first simulation scenario, we let VE h stay at 80% after 4 weeks, and we analyzed the resulting interval-censored data using the proposed method with a log hazard ratio that decreases linearly between weeks 0 and 4 and stays constant after week 4. For comparison, we fit the same model by treating the time of the first positive antibody test as a potentially right-censored event time and performing maximum partial likelihood estimation [5, 8] ; we refer to this approach as naive Cox regression. (Naive Cox regression estimates the same VE parameter using the same data as the proposed method, the only difference being that it converts interval-censored event times to potentially right-censored event times.) For further comparison, we implemented logistic regression by treating the seroconversion status at the last blood test before the 10.5 month mark (excluding the blood samples drawn after unblinded crossover) as a binary outcome and estimating the odds ratio of seroconversion between the vaccine and the placebo groups by the maximum likelihood estimator. Table 1 summarizes the results of these simulation studies. Using the proposed method, the VE estimates are unbiased, the standard errors are accurately estimated, and the confidence intervals have proper coverage probabilities. The standard error is lower under blinded than unblinded crossover, and lower under priority-dependent than priority-independent crossover. The standard error is slightly higher under no crossover than under blinded priority-dependent crossover. (Note that there are fewer sampling points under no crossover than under crossover.) In comparison, naive Cox regression may under-estimate or overestimate the true VE, and logistic regression always under-estimates the true VE.\n",
            " In our second simulation scenario, we let VE h stay at 80% after 4 weeks or let it decrease to 0 at 1 year. We implemented the proposed method (for interval-censored data) using a piecewise linear function for the log hazard ratio, with a change point placed at 4 weeks and with the two slopes estimated from the data. For comparison, we also implemented naive Cox regression with the same piecewise linear function for the log hazard ratio. 7 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.\n",

Tables 2-3 show the simulation results on the estimation of VE a over successive time periods under constant VE and waning VE, respectively. The proposed method yields unbiased VE a estimates, with accurate standard error estimates and proper confidence intervals in virtually all cases. Naive Cox regression yields severely biased VE a estimates. Figure 2 displays the estimation results produced by the proposed method in one of the trials simulated under waning VE. The estimated VE h and VE a curves are close to the truth, and the 95% confidence intervals nearly cover the entire true curves. As expected, the confidence intervals are the narrowest under blinded priority-dependent crossover and the widest under unblinded priority-independent crossover. In addition, the confidence intervals for VE h are wider than the confidence intervals for VE a at the right tail.\n",
            " We also conducted a series of simulation studies mimicking the Prevent COVID U study (Supplementary Appendix 2.2). A total of 12,000 participants enter the study at a constant rate over one month. Half of them are randomly selected to receive the Moderna vaccine at enrollment, and the other half get their first injection with a 4 month delay. We assumed a downward trend of infection over time; we adopted the VE patterns from the first series of simulation studies but placed the change point at 6 weeks instead of 4 weeks.\n",
            " We explored various swabbing/RT-PCR testing schedules, ranging from every day to every 2 weeks. Each participant is followed for 4 months, and the study ends at month 5, when the last enrolled participant has been followed for 4 months. We also considered a scenario where 50% of the delayed-arm participants receive outside vaccines before the end of follow-up; in the analysis, we discarded the data collected after outside vaccination. Table 4 summarizes the simulation results on the estimation of constant VE. The proposed method yields unbiased VE estimates, with accurate standard error estimates and proper confidence intervals in all cases. The standard error of the VE estimate tends to increase a little bit as RT-PCR testing becomes less frequent. There is a slight loss of precision in the VE estimates when the delayed-arm participants are allowed to receive outside vaccines. In comparison, naive Cox regression shows highly similar results to the proposed method when RT-PCR testing is performed every day; however, as RT-PCR testing becomes 8 All rights reserved.

Excluding the events within the first 6 weeks substantially reduces the precision of VE estimates. (The substantial loss of precision is due to relatively high incidence in the first 6 weeks under decreasing background incidence over time and high VE. In the setting of constant background incidence with VE of 0.6 after 4 weeks, excluding the events within the first 4 weeks incurs about 13% loss of statistical efficiency.) Table 5 presents the results on the estimation of VE a over successive time periods when VE h decreases to 0 at 1 year. The proposed method provides unbiased VE a estimates, along with proper confidence intervals. Naive Cox regression performs well when RT-PCR testing is done daily but performs poorly when RT-PCR testing is infrequent.\n",
            " We have assumed that VE ramps to an unknown peak level 4 weeks (or 6 weeks) after the first injection of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (or the Moderna vaccine). We can allow uncertainty in this change point by including several change points in the analysis or by selecting the change point through the Akaike information criterion (AIC). We evaluated these strategies by extending the simulation studies reported in Table 1 Table 6 , the first method performs very well, although the standard error is higher than using a single change point. The second method correctly selects the change point with high probability.\n",

            " The form of the model considered in this article is essentially the same as that used in our previous work on evaluating VE against symptomatic COVID-19 [7] . However, here the estimation approach is different because infection times are interval-censored rather than potentially right-censored. The proposed methodology is general enough to include potentially right-censored data as a special case and thus offers an alternative way to assess VE against symptomatic COVID-19. A major advantage of this new approach is that it provides a unified framework for studying constant versus waning VE.\n",
            " Another important contribution of this work is a careful treatment of the ramping VE after initial vaccination. The prevailing approach is not to count the events that occur within 4-6 weeks of the first injection [1] [2] . Discarding the first 4-6 weeks of follow-up data causes considerable loss of statistical efficiency, as shown in Table 4 . In the case of blinded crossover, excluding the events that occur within 4-6 weeks of crossover will further reduce statistical efficiency, whereas including all the events will result in biased VE estimates.\n",

Thus, infrequent serology will capture more infections than infrequent RT-PCR. Some asymptomatic infections never seroconvert or have transient seroconversion that may be missed by infrequent serology [9] [10] . However, those who do not seroconvert tend to be less infectious than those who do, such that missed seronegative infections may be clinically less important. Likewise, an asymptomatic infection that is RT-PCR positive for just a day or two is difficult to detect but may have little public-health relevance.\n",

In particular, investigators wish to capture potential infectiousness by measuring the peak viral load, the duration of viral shedding, and the area under the viral load curve. If detecting the presence of viral RNA were the study's only goal, then less frequent testing would be needed. The proposed methods (for interval-censored data) may be warranted in the case that a substantial number of swabs are not collected or are not usable (due to improper collection or storage).\n",
            " Blood samples and nasal swabs provide complementary information about SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral RNA can be detected sooner after infection than seroconversion, but antibody lasts longer than viral shedding [6, [9] [10] . There is considerable heterogeneity in the duration of both seropositivity and RT-PCR positivity, with the biggest driving factor being symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection [6, [9] [10] . Many studies collect both blood and nasal samples. For example, the Moderna phase 3 trial [2] performs RT-PCR testing at month 1 and at crossover in addition periodic serology. The Prevent COVID U study performs periodic (every 2 months) serology and frequent RT-PCR testing. The proposed methods can be applied to the two types of infection data separately or as a combined endpoint, depending on the objective of the analysis and the frequency of each type of test.\n",
            " The monitoring times are assumed to be independent of the infection time (conditional on covariates). This assumption is satisfied for planned diagnostic tests but is unlikely to hold if SARS-CoV-2 infection is detected through symptom-prompted testing. We can apply the proposed methods (for interval-censored data) to planned tests and standard Cox regression with potentially right-censored data to symptom-prompted tests. If the planned RT-PCR testing is frequent, then the data from planned and symptom-prompted RT-PCR tests can be combined and standard Cox regression for potentially right-censored data can be adopted.\n",

Thus, we let λ 0 (·) be completely nonparametric and approximate η(·), which is the parameter of main interest, by B-spline functions. One benefit of this approach is that it provides a unified framework to study constant versus time-varying VE (by choosing appropriate B-spline functions).\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Adenoviruses (Ad) possess several attributes that make them suitable candidates for vaccine vectors [1, 2] . Ad exert an adjuvantlike effect by stimulating the innate immune system through both Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent and TLR-independent pathways [3, 4] . The effectiveness of Ad vector-based vaccines against many infectious diseases, including measles, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and Ebola has been evaluated in animal models and clinical trials in humans [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Previously, we and others have explored the potential of a human Ad serotype 5 (HAd5) vectorbased vaccine strategy for H5N1 influenza [10] [11] [12] . Our immunogenicity and protective efficacy studies demonstrated that Ad vector-based vaccines provide complete protection against challenge with homologous and antigenically distinct strains of influenza viruses in a mouse model [11] .\n",
            " There is a high incidence of Ad infections in the general population due to the circulation of more than fifty Ad serotypes. Their ubiquitous nature results in the development of Ad-specific neutralizing antibodies, popularly known as 'preexisting vector immunity' in the majority of the individuals [13] [14] [15] . Adneutralizing antibodies inhibit the vector extracellularly, while Ad-specific CD8+ T cells destroy vector expressing cells [16, 17] thereby adversely impacting the duration and levels of transgene expression. Experimental studies in animal models have shown that in the presence of extremely high levels of Ad-neutralizing antibodies, there is a significant inhibition in the development of immunogen-specific immune responses [18] . A comprehensive analysis of Ad seroprevalence found that HAd5 neutralizing antibody titers in the study's participants varied by geographic location and ranged from 18 to 4690 [19] . According to this study, 26% of the participants had titers below 200, 40% had titers below 1000, and 20% exhibited titers greater than 1000. These studies have underscored the need to further evaluate the role of vector immunity in inhibiting the immunogenicity and efficacy of HAd vector-based vaccines.\n",
            " To determine the level of vector immunity that can be tolerated without significantly affecting the vaccine efficacy, we primed groups of mice with varying doses of wild type (WT) HAd5 via intranasal (i.n.) or intramuscular (i.m.) route of inoculation to generate different levels of HAd5-neutralizing antibody titers. After the development of HAd5-specific immunity, HAd-primed mice were immunized i.n. or i.m. with a low or high dose of a HAd vector (HAd-HA-NP) carrying the hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of the A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) influenza virus. We also assessed if we could overcome vector immunity by increasing the vaccine dose and changing the route of immunization. Our results suggest that a high level (up to a neutralization titer of 2240) of vector immunity can be tolerated or effectively overcome by increasing the vaccine dose or using alternate routes of vaccination.\n",
            " Generation and characterization of HAd vector expressing HA and NP of H5N1 influenza virus (HAd-HA-NP)\n",
            " The full coding region of HA under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter and bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal (polyA) and full length coding region of NP gene of the A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus under the control of the murine CMV promoter and the simian virus 40 (SV40) polyA were inserted into early region 1 (E1) of the HAd genome using the Cre-recombinase-mediated site-specific recombination system [20] . Both genes in HAd-HA-NP were in the E1-parallel orientation. The recombinant vector, HAd-HA-NP ( Figure 1A ) showed visible cytopathic effect (c.p.e.) on the ninth day post-transfection. Western blot analysis was done to confirm the expression of HA and NP in 293 cells. Two distinct polypeptide bands of approximate molecular weights 77 kDa and 50 kDa, representing the HA precursor (HA0) and a proteolytic cleavage product (HA1), respectively, ( Figure 1B) were observed in the HAd-HA-NP infected 293 cell lysate. A single band at approximate molecular weight of 56 kDa representing NP ( Figure 1C ) was visible in the HAd-HA-NP infected 293 cell lysate.\n",
            " To mimic in a mouse model the preexisting immunity against HAd5 observed in the majority of the human population, groups of animals were inoculated i.n. or i.m. with a single dose of 10 7 , 10 8 , or 10 9 plaque forming units (p.f.u.) HAd-WT. Both i.n. and i.m. primed groups showed a dose-dependent increase in the levels of HAd-specific neutralizing antibody titers ( Figure 2 ). As expected, the highest HAd-specific neutralizing antibody titers in i.n. inoculated HAd-primed groups were observed with a 10 9 p.f.u. dose of HAd-WT (2240) followed by 10 8 p.f.u. (1040) and 10 7 p.f.u. (300) dose ( Figure 2) . Similarly, the i.m. primed group receiving 10 9 p.f.u. of HAd-WT developed the highest titer (3040) followed by 10 8 p.f.u. (1480) and 10 7 p.f.u. (520) dose groups (Fig. 2) . The i.m. primed groups resulted in the development of higher levels of HAd-specific neutralizing antibody titers compared to the i.n. primed groups.\n",
            " Induction of humoral immune response in HAd-primed mice immunized with HAd-HA-NP Development of a robust HA-specific antibody response is an important indicator of the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an influenza vaccine [21] . The i.n. or i.m. immunization of HAd-primed groups indicating that alternating the route of priming and immunization or increasing the vaccine dose can partially overcome the vector immunity.\n",
            " In the 10 9 i.n. HAd-primed group, i.n. immunization with HAd-HA-NP induced lower serum HI titers (22) . Alternating with the i.m. route of immunization resulted in slight improvement in the HI titers (34) . Increasing the vaccine dose by five-fold resulted in further improvement in HI titers in mice immunized either i.n. (52) or i.m. (80) indicating that the i.n.-induced (which mimics the natural route of infection in humans) vector immunity can be partially overcome by increasing the vaccine dose (P#0.05). However, in the 10 9 i.m. HAd-primed groups immunized with HAd-HA-NP, a HI titer of 30 was induced, and there were no significant changes in the titers by either alternating the route of vaccine inoculation or with an increased vaccine dose. These results indicate that the levels of vector immunity induced by i.m. priming with 10 9 p.f.u. of HAd5-WT negatively impact the development of a humoral immune response against a HAd vector-based vaccine.\n",
            " Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays an important role in virus clearance and thus contributes to the recovery from an influenza infection [22, 23] . As anticipated, the HAd-HA-NP vaccine elicited significantly higher percentages of NP-147 epitope-specific CD8 T cells in the naïve groups compared to the vector (HAd-DE1E3) control group ( Figure 3A & 3B) . The percentages of NP-147 epitope-specific CD8 T cells in 10 7 HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) was significantly higher than in vector control groups following immunization with HAd-HA-NP by either the i.n. or i.m. route. However, the percentages NP-147-specific CD8 T cells were 1.5-2 fold lower in HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) compared to naïve groups, suggesting that preexisting vector immunity had a modest effect on the induction of CMI following immunization with HAd-HA-NP ( Figure 3A & 3B) .\n",
            " The percentages of NP-147 epitope-specific CD8 T cells in 10 8 HAd-primed groups were two-fold lower compared to the 10 7 HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) following immunization with HAd-HA-NP by either route (Figure 3A & 3B) . Interestingly, increasing the vaccine dose by five-fold resulted in significantly higher percentages of NP-147 epitope-specific CD8 T cells in the 10 8 HAd-primed groups compared to both 10 7 and 10 8 HAdprimed groups receiving the lower dose (10 8 p.f.u.) of the vaccine. As expected, a further increase in the level of preexisting vector immunity led to a further decrease in the percentages of NP-147 epitope-specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, an increase in the vaccine dose by five-fold resulted in significantly higher percentages of NP-147 epitope-specific CD8 T cells in the 10 9 i.n. primed group compared to the 10 9 i.n. primed group receiving the lower vaccine dose (10 8 p.f.u.). However, this increase was not noticeable in the 10 9 i.m. primed group.\n",
            " The functionality of HA-518 and NP-147-specific CD8 T cells was assessed by enumerating interferon-c (IFN-c) expressing cells by ELISpot assay. Significantly higher numbers of IFN-c-secreting HA-518-and NP-147-specific CD8 T cells were detected in the spleens from the naïve groups immunized i.n. or i.m. with HAd-HA-NP compared to the vector control groups following stimulation with the HA-518 (P#0.0001) or NP-147 (P#0.0001) peptide, respectively ( Figure 4A-D) . In general, the number of IFN-c-secreting HA-518-or NP-147-specific CD8 T cells in the spleens of HAd-primed groups immunized with the vaccine were lower compared to the naïve immunized groups, and a five-fold increase in the vaccine dose resulted in an increase in the number of IFN-c secreting HA-518-or NP-147-specific CD8 T cells in all the primed groups except for the 10 9 i.m. primed groups ( Figure 4A-D) . Overall, it seems that with the increase in preexisting HAd5-neutralizing antibodies, there was a titerdependent decline in the CMI response which significantly improved with an increase in the vaccine dose by five-fold. There was excellent correlation between the ELISpot and NP pentamer staining data.\n",
            " Protection of HAd-primed mice immunized with HAd-HA-NP following challenge with a reassortant H5N1 influenza virus Log 10 EID 50 /ml). Similarly, the 10 7 HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) immunized with HAd-HA-NP had lung viral titers at or below the level of detection (1.5 Log 10 EID 50 /ml) indicating that the preexisting vector immunity did not adversely impact the protective efficacy. However, the 10 8 HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) immunized with HAd-HA-NP by the same route that was used for priming exhibited less efficient virus clearance from the lungs. Interestingly, either using a different route of inoculation for priming and vaccination or increasing the vaccine dose by five-fold resulted in lung viral titers at or below the level of detection. In the 10 9 i.n. HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) immunized with HAd-HA-NP by the same route that was used for priming, there was only partial (approximately 2-4 logs) virus clearance. By changing the route of priming and immunization, complete protection was observed only in the group where the i.n. priming was followed by a five-fold increase in the vaccine dose administered by either route (i.m. or i.n.). Even a five-fold increase in the vaccine dose did not yield complete protection in the 10 9 i.m. HAd-primed groups immunized with HAd-HA-NP by either route (i.n. or i.m.)\n",
            " suggesting that the level of preexisting vector-neutralizing antibody titer could serve as an indicator for predicting the efficacy of Adbased vaccines.\n",
            " To meet the global vaccine demand in a pandemic, various eggindependent vaccine strategies need to be explored to supplement egg-dependent influenza vaccine approaches. Ad vector-based influenza vaccines have been shown in clinical studies to be safe and immunogenic in humans [24, 25] . The strong innate and adaptive immune responses induced by Ad vectors impart adjuvant-like properties facilitating better immune responses against the transgene product/s. However, several preclinical studies have suggested that the presence of preexisting HAdspecific neutralizing antibodies might inhibit the generation of immune responses against the expressed immunogen [1, 14, 18] . In the present study, we evaluated the role of preexisting HAd5specific neutralizing antibodies in inhibiting the immunogenicity Table 1 .

Low levels of vector immunity (,520 virusneutralization titer) did not seem to adversely affect the protective vaccine efficacy, while further increases in vector immunity were taken care of by using an alternate route of immunization or by an increase in the vaccine dose. The importance of NP-specific CD4 T cells and non-neutralizing antibodies in the virus clearance was not pursued in this study.\n",
            " To mimic the natural exposure of HAd to the majority of humans, we primed mice with HAd5 by the i.n. route to establish the state of preexisting vector immunity since many HAd infect via the mucosal route. The i.m. HAd5-primed groups represented the development of HAd-specific immune responses following i.m. immunization with a HAd vector-based vaccine. We attempted to circumvent the inhibitory effect of high levels of preexisting vector immunity by either a change in the route of vaccine inoculation or an increase in the vaccine dose.\n",
            " In the presence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies (300-520), there was a modest decline in the levels of CMI and HI levels in response to immunization with HAd-HA-NP. This level of immune response was sufficient enough to provide excellent protection against the challenge with a H5N1 reassortant virus. There were lower levels of humoral and cellular immune responses after the i.n. immunization compared to the i.m. immunization which is consistent with earlier findings [11, [26] [27] [28] .\n",
            " Further increase in the levels of vector-specific neutralizing antibody response (1000-1480) resulted in a greater decline in influenza virus-specific immune responses with the inhibition more pronounced when the route of inoculation for Ad-priming and influenza virus immunization were the same (e.g., i.n. and i.n., i.m. and i.m.). This level of vector immunity could be overcome either by changing the route of priming and immunization or by increasing the vaccine dose by five-fold. To test the upper limit of vector immunity that could be tolerated without adversely Figure 3 . NP-147 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells in naïve or HAd5-primed mice immunized with HAd-HA-NP. Naïve or HAd-primed mice were immunized as described in the Materials and Methods. At four weeks after final immunization, animals were euthanized, and the spleens were collected. Single cell suspensions were prepared by passage through screens, and 1610 6 cells were stained with a murine MHC-encoded allele k dspecific pentamer for immunodominant NP-147 epitope-conjugated with phycoerythrin (PE) and also with anti-CD8 antibody-conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC) and anti-CD19 antibody-conjugated with flouro-isothiocyanin (FITC). Flow cytometeric analysis was done to identify the number of NP-147-specific CD8+ T cells. Data were collected using BD FACSCanto II (BD Bioscience, CA) and FACSDiva software was used for analysis. affecting the vaccine protective efficacy, the vector-specific neutralizing antibody titer was raised to 2240 by i.n. priming with high doses of HAd5. The inhibitory effect was partially overcome by the five-fold increase in the vaccine dose, and the resultant immune response was sufficient to provide complete protection. Further increase in the level of vector-specific neutralizing antibody titer to 3040 by i.m. priming with HAd5 only provided partial protection even in the groups receiving a high vaccine dose.\n",
            " Alternating the route of priming and immunization was partially successful in overcoming vector immunity thus indicating the potential role of the route of inoculation in developing the level of humoral and CMI responses. It has been suggested that the route of vaccination impacts the magnitude, phenotype and trafficking of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in mice [29, 30] . A HAdbased HIV vaccine also showed some inhibition in eliciting immunogen-specific immune responses in the presence of vector immunity, however, this effect was minimized by increasing the vaccine dose [31] . Nevertheless, in a clinical trial with a HAdbased influenza vaccine, there were no strong correlations between vector immunity levels and a decrease in vaccine efficacy [25] . The inhibitory effect of vector immunity was more pronounced for the humoral immune response compared to the CMI response which is consistent with previous reports [32] [33] [34] . Taken together, our data clearly show that the magnitude of humoral and cellular immune responses to Ad-vectored vaccine antigens depend upon the levels of preexisting antibodies against the vector. However, vector-specific immune responses can be overcome by increasing the antigen dose or by administering antigen by a different route. In conclusion, based on the present study alone, it will be difficult to predict the range of the vector immunity in humans that can be tolerated or overcome by either increasing the dose or changing the route of administration of the HAd5 vector-based vaccines. Nevertheless, the study does highlight the importance of exploring these strategies in humans to improve the outcome of HAd5 vector-based vaccines.\n",

The polybasic cleavage site QRERRRKKRQG present in the HA gene of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) influenza virus was modified to QRETRQG to reduce the rare possibility of genetic exchange between the HA in HAd-HA-NP vaccine and a circulating strains of influenza A virus.

            "Body Text:\n",
            " The isolation of the human adenovirus in the early 1950s was an important step in our understanding of this common pathogen, which is typically asso ciated with mild, selflimiting infections. Advances in molecular and cellular biology in the 1990s permitted the use of human and nonhuman adenoviruses as nonreplicating vectors for the delivery of vaccines and therapeutic genes. The advantages of adenoviral vector vaccines include their proven ability to drive immune activation, low production costs and high stability, par ticularly for longterm storage. These vaccines have been widely evaluated in cancer trials and also used for vaccination against human infections, such as HIV, Ebola virus and Zika virus. Given their history of effi cacy and safety, two adenoviral vector vaccines were rapidly developed for SARSCoV2: one produced by Johnson and Johnson using HAdV26 and another by AstraZeneca/COVIShield using the chimpanzeebased ChAdOx1 vector. Metaanalysis documented the clinical effectiveness of these vaccines as well as their ability to induce high antibody titres and T cell reactivity against SARSCoV2 (ref. 1 ). Although the safety data from clini cal trials were reassuring, given the limited sample size, these trials would not have identified very rare serious adverse effects (SAEs) such as vaccineinduced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).\n",
            " Shortly after the emergence of SARSCoV2, it became apparent that individuals infected with the virus showed a high risk of thromboembolic events. In a metaanalysis of some 8,000 patients with COVID19, arterial and venous thromboembolic complications were observed in 2% and 21% of patients, respectively, which significantly increased the risk of death 2 . It is noteworthy that many of the arterial and venous thrombi associated with VITT are anatomically unusual. However, other clots resemble the thromboembolic complications observed in unvac cinated patients with COVID19. The mechanistic basis of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID19 is still unclear, but there is evidence of generalized activation of the coagulation cascade. In a study of ten patients with acute COVID19, we found that a number of the patients had immune complexes in their plasma that activated platelets 3 . Some of these patients also had elevated levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) 3 .\n",
            " The widespread use of adenoviral vector vaccines for COVID19 began in late 2020 and had an immediate positive impact in reducing severe illness and death. However, by early April 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had received reports of atypical thrombi following vaccination and concluded that there was a signal of disproportionality. Initial reports described atypical cerebral thrombi, especially in young women and occurring days to several weeks after vaccination with COVID19 adenoviral vector vaccines.\n",
            " The reports, often in young people, of unexpected venous or arterial clots post vaccination were distinct from the thromboses observed in patients with COVID19 infection. These events were accompanied by low levels of platelets and were highly reminiscent of the early reports describing heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) 4 . Heparin, a longchain anionic glycosaminoglycan, can bind to PF4 -a small positively charged protein -causing atrisk individuals to form antibodies to the PF4-heparin complexes 4 . These antibodies can crosslink and form immune complexes capable of binding to platelet FcγRIIa receptors, which leads to activation of platelets and other cells and triggers coagulation.\n",
            " Towards an understanding of VITT Very few clinical conditions cause both arterial and venous thrombi in unusual locations, accompanied by thrombocytopenia and generalized activation of the coagulation cascade. VITT mirrors HIT with regard to these clinical and laboratory characteristics 4 . Within weeks of the first VITT reports, three different groups all reported the presence of antibodies to PF4 in patients with VITT, but not in vaccinated persons without VITT 5-7 . But a major difference between HIT and VITT www.nature.com/nri 0123456789();:\n",
            " was apparent -specifically, that patients with VITT had not received heparin. To date, it is not possible to deter mine whether the two currently available adenoviral vector COVID19 vaccines pose a difference in the risk of developing VITT. Complexities in reporting and lack of serological confirmation adds to the uncertainty. In our laboratory, the majority of patients who are suspected of having VITT turn out to be serologically negative and do not have VITT. This means that at least some clinically diagnosed episodes of VITT are not causally related to the vaccination. Adding to the difficulties in understanding VITT and its association with adenoviral vector vaccines is a patient who had VITT following an mRNA vaccine 8 . It remains uncertain whether this was a causal or a coincidental association.\n",
            " Our laboratory has studied the epitopes on PF4 that are targeted by the antibodies in patients with HIT. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis to identify antibodybinding sites, we found that patients with HIT have a polyclonal response targeting multiple amino acids on the PF4 tetramer 9 . We used a similar approach to study the epitopes on PF4 that constitute the VITT antibodybinding sites and identified a unique and con served VITT antibodybinding site on the PF4 tetramer made up of eight amino acids, within the heparin bind ing site 10 . In contrast to what is seen in HIT, the VITT antibodies did not require heparin for immune complex formation and FcγRIIadependent platelet activation. Consistently, we found that therapeutic doses of hep arin inhibited the reaction, which can be explained by the overlapping binding region on PF4 between VITT antibodies and heparin 10 . The question then became: is it possible that the PF4 antibodies in patients who develop VITT crosslink PF4 tetramers on their own, thereby forming immune complexes capable of acti vating platelets? Using biolayer interferometry, we C o m m e n t In most people, administration of an adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine induces antibodies to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and protects the recipient against COVID-19 (steps 1-4). In rare cases (step 5), vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) antibodies are induced that can bind to platelet factor 4 (PF4) and form immune complexes that activate platelets (steps 5-7). This leads to pathological activation of clotting cascades and a fall in platelet counts (steps 8-9). VITT-associated clots have been described in the brains, lungs, abdomen, liver and legs (step 10). Image courtesy of Christy Groves, adapted by S. Bradbrook/Springer Nature Limited.\n",
            " documented that, first, patients with VITT antibodies have a strong antibody response to PF4 (a measure of the amount of antibody produced to an antigen) and, sec ond, VITTassociated antibodies show a similar dissoci ation rate from PF4 to HITassociated antibodies 10 . We also noted that VITTassociated antibodies show higher binding to PF4 than to PF4-heparin complexes. These observations demonstrate that VITT antibodies have sufficient binding strength (avidity) to form immune complexes with PF4 and to crosslink FcγRIIa receptors on platelets and consequently activate platelets, produc ing procoagulantrich microparticles and activating the coagulation cascade ( fig. 1) .\n",
            " These observations provided a framework for better understanding the clotting disorder of VITT following vaccination with an adenoviral vector vaccine. The rapid formation, literally within days, of the IgG autoanti bodies suggests an anamnestic response. The mecha nism by which the vaccines induce VITTassociated antibodies remains unknown. One possibility is that PF4 might complex with electronegative surface charges on the adenoviral vector rendering it immunogenic, in a similar manner to how it can bind other polyanions, such as heparin, DNA and bacteria.\n",
            " It is likely that adenoviral vector vaccines will continue to be needed around the world. Several steps should be taken. First, our data emphasized that VITT is fre quently clinically overdiagnosed, making a rare disorder appear more common. Standard serological tests should be required to confirm the diagnosis. Second, until we have developed more effective treatments for VITT, the focus should shift to modification of the vaccine to prevent VITT. Just as pharmacological strategies modi fying heparin molecules progressively reduced the risk of HIT, it is likely that modifications to the adenoviral vector vaccines can lead to even safer vaccines. A better understanding of the components of the vaccine that trigger the formation of autoantibodies to PF4 should be an early focus.\n",

            " The ideal scenario for efficacious vaccination requires initiation of a potent immune response by a vaccine formulated to resemble the situation of the natural infection [1, 2] . In reality, vaccines are manufactured to resemble as close as possible the pathogen in question, but lacking a pathogenic nature; elaboration of this approach has sought to dissect the vaccine into the most pertinent immunogenic component(s) for promotion of protective immune defences. With virus vaccines based on the whole virus, approaches have included the application of attenuated variants as well as inactivated antigen. Moreover, a study of the evolution in vaccine design to combat viral infections shows how manipulations of the vaccine composition have increased the success rate for generating efficacious vaccines. An appreciation of these approaches, and their evolution, shows three main elements essential for successful vaccination. (i) The antigenic characteristics of the vaccine itself. (ii) The mode of vaccine delivery; until the last decade often ignored or relegated to the position of an ''also-ran''. This has a particular significance in that efficient vaccine delivery relates directly to vaccine proficiency at targeting the host immune system. (iii) Adjuvant application, a major tool and often critically important component for an efficacious vaccine. This is a major provider of the ''danger'' signals necessary for activating the innate responses essential for promoting efficacious specific immune defences. Although viruses and bacterial components can themselves provide danger signals, these may require efficient replication of the pathogen, which is not possible with inactivated or subunit vaccines. Alternatively, only a week danger signal may be provided due to a low-level interaction with the appropriate receptors, or the presence of inhibitory signals.\n",
            " Overall, the vaccine must be efficiently delivered to the appropriate compartments of the immune system, leading to the correct signalling of the immune system to process the vaccine, and promotion of efficacious vaccination. Accordingly, an important issue for vaccine design is consideration of the ligands carried by a number of pathogens, which interact with receptors on cells of the immune system. Adjuvants also contain components interacting with immune cells, particularly of the innate immune defences. In both respects, the involvement of dendritic cells (DC) is crucial, due to their role as central players in the immune defence development (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). DC ensure both appropriate recognition of danger signals and correct processing of the vaccine antigen, promoting efficacious development of innate and acquired immune defences [3] .\n",
            " In order to appreciate how vaccines can be targeted to the immune system, for enhancing their efficacy, it is necessary to Developmental Based on the promise for the rational design of vaccine platforms, the current review will provide an update on particle-based vaccines of both viral and synthetic origin, giving examples of recombinant virus carriers such as adenoviruses and biodegradable particulate carriers. The viral carriers carry pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), used by the original virus for targeting DC, and are particularly efficient and versatile gene delivery vectors. Efforts in the field of synthetic vaccine carriers are focussing on decorating the particle surface with ligands for DC receptors such as heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan structures, integrins, Siglecs, galectins, C-type lectins and toll-like receptors. The emphasis of this review will be placed on targeting the porcine immune system, but reference will be made to advances with murine and human vaccine delivery systems where information on DC targeting is available.\n",

            " appreciate the central role played by the DC therein, because these are critical targets for vaccine delivery ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Most inactivated, protein-based vaccines induce acquired (specific) immune responses involving MHC Class II-restricted T-helper (Th) and B lymphocytes: Antibody-dependent immune defences. An additional defence important for removing infected or ''altered self'' host cells is that involving MHC Class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, although these are less evident following vaccination with inactivated vaccines. Overall, the central and key player for inducing efficacious acquired immunity is the DC [4] . These areas are covered in detail elsewhere [3] . Following endocytosis of the vaccine, DC process the antigen towards presentation of derived peptides to T lymphocytes (in association with either MHC Class II or Class I molecules). Advances in murine and rat immunology have shown that DC may ''deliver'' antigen in a more intact form to B lymphocytes, releasing the antigen to stimulate the B lymphocytes [5] . Furthermore, DC release cytokines of major importance for B lymphocyte activity: type I interferon (IFN), IL-6, IL-12 and BAFF [6] . Efficacious vaccination is dependent on the efficiency with which the vaccine interacts with the DC subsets. This raises the question of vaccine delivery, which will influence how both conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) -as well as monocytes and macrophages -become involved. DC possess a broad spectrum of cell surface receptors involved in the initiation, promotion and execution of immune responses [7] ; importantly, the expression patterns for these receptors vary between cDC and pDC. Among these are the TLR, scavenger receptors, and C-type lectin receptors (Fig. 1 ). All are important pattern recognition receptors (PRR), recognizing PAMP on pathogens -and indeed antigens, adjuvants and vaccines -essential for the development of innate immune responses and defences [8, 9] . With PAMP binding to PRR on the DC surface, they also offer potential as targets for vaccine delivery. Ligation of particular PRR evokes rapid activation of the cell, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release and upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules on leukocytes, as seen with DC and macrophages [9] . With other PRR, such as certain C-type lectin receptors, their ligation leads to enhanced endocytosis. For DC acting as antigen-presenting cells (APC), the ligation can also lead to induction of DC maturation-an essential step licensing these cells to induce potent effector as well as memory immune responses [10, 11] . A good example of PAMP ligating PRR to activate cDC is seen with bacterial lipopeptides and lipoproteins recognized by heterodimeric TLR2-TLR1 or TLR2-TLR6. Lipopeptides deliver a strong activation signal to DC, which is the basis of their potent activity as immunoadjuvants in vitro and in vivo, at least in rodents and primates [12] [13] [14] . C-type lectin PRR such as the multilectin DEC-205 receptor and the mannose receptor are more involved in enhanced endocytosis. Ligation of these receptors has also shown potential for vaccine targeting and activation of DC [15] . In the murine system, ligation of DEC-205 enhances receptor-dependent endocytic processes leading to efficient recycling of the antigen through late endosomes-such processing is likely to enhance antigen presentation to CD4 + helper T lymphocytes. In contrast, ligation of the mannose receptor tends more to promote recycling through the peripheral endosomal compartment.\n",
            " These few examples of how targeting specific receptors on DC can result in a different form of signalling to the DC is an important consideration for targeting vaccines to the immune system. Dependent on the receptor being targeted, the antigen may be ''delivered'' to different compartments of the DC, with important consequences for the type of immune response induced. Consequently the following sections will use selected examples of vaccine developments to demonstrate how vaccine may be targeting the immune system. When possible, examples will be given for the porcine field. This will be elaborated using more general advances in immunology characterizing the interaction of DC with vaccine carriers promoting interaction with surface receptors on the DC.\n",
            " An important element in the concept of recombinant vector vaccines is selecting immunogenic structures of the pathogen to replace the pathogen itself, ensuring its efficient delivery to the immune system as in the form of a biologically active carrier. This approach helps reduce the risks associated with handling the live pathogen, and the problems of incomplete inactivation or reversion of attenuation. The approach must ensure that the vaccine retains a high level of immunogenicity, which is more difficult to achieve with subunit or protein/peptide vaccines.\n",
            " Viruses possess natural ligands for binding to receptors of the cells they infect; receptors have been identified for some viruses employed for vaccine design, but not for all (Fig. 2) . Although Fig. 1 . Examples of known receptors on DC, which may have potential for targeting vaccines, based on work performed with vaccine targeting to DC, or from analyses of the ligands with which the receptors interact. many viruses infect epithelial cells, a large number can interact directly with DC, in particular monocytotropic viruses. Also a restricted infection of epithelial cells can be immunogenic after antigen ''transfer'' to the DC, following exocytosis from the producing cell.\n",
            " A disadvantage of viral vectors is the immune response against the vector itself, which restricts its application in terms of multiple use for different vaccines. However, the formation of antibody complexes with the vaccine can have certain advantages in terms of the immune reaction induced. For example, FcgRI-targeting of adenovirus vector can enhance vector-mediated gene transfer into human DC, leading to an increased immune response against the vector-encoded antigen [16] .\n",
            " Vaccinia virus was one of the earliest viruses employed as a vector for the generation of recombinant vaccines, generally for all species [17] . In 1986, a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing influenza virus haemagglutinin was tested in cattle, sheep and poultry [18] . On the porcine front, a vaccinia virus was employed to generate a recombinant vaccine expressing pseudorabies virus (PRV) glycoprotein gp50 [19] . An overview of reports on vaccinia virus recombinants employed as vectors for porcine vaccines is given in Table 1 , including the recent application of the recombinant modified Ankara vaccinia virus [20] (Table 1a) . [22] Related to the application of vaccinia vectors, swine poxvirus has also been proposed as the basis for a porcine recombinant vaccine [21] (Table 1b) . Although it has not been tested as a porcine vaccine vector, swine poxvirus has clear potential, for example from the work with feline leukaemia virus antigens and infection of porcine cells [22] (Table 1b) . Both fowlpox virus and parapoxvirus (ORF virus) have been employed as vectors for potential porcine vaccines (Table 1b) . Interestingly, the ORF virus vector also displays adjuvant potential for inducing IFN responses [23] (Table 1b) .\n",
            " Whether vaccinia virus can enter porcine DC leading to viral DNA replication or transcription is uncertain. From studies using mouse and human cells, it appears that the virus does interact with DC [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] ; to date, the receptor involved has not been defined, although it is possible to propose potential candidates (Fig. 2) . Certainly, vaccinia virus is less efficient at binding to human DC compared with a human epithelial cell line [24] . Jenne et al. [25] also demonstrated difficulties for vaccinia virus to replicate in human DC -immature as well as mature -leading to an abortive infection in which proteins under control of the late promoters were lacking. Nevertheless, a certain level of protein translation does occur in DC, which could promote antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation.\n",
            " As mentioned above, DC processing of the antigen alone is inadequate for efficient promotion of immune responses; induction of DC maturation is also required, typically through ''danger'' signalling. With respect to vaccine vectors, there is a reported absence of vaccinia virus-induced maturation in the DC [24] . Moreover, a reduced expression of certain costimulatory molecules -CD80 and CD83, but not CD86 or MHC -on the virusinfected DC, together with a reduced capacity for stimulating T-cell proliferation was observed [25] . The modified vaccinia virus Ankara was even more problematic for human DC in terms of reduced cellular protein synthesis leading to increased apoptosis in the virus-infected DC [27] . While these latter events would be advantageous to the development of cytotoxic immunity, through cross-presentation of the apoptotic cells, the results overall query the value of direct interaction of vaccinia virus vectors with DC. Yates and Alexander-Miller [28] showed that when vaccinia virus infected immature DC, there was no induction of maturation, yielding DC incapable of initiating T-cell activation. It was only when mature DC were infected with vaccinia virus that functional antigen-presenting cells were generated, capable of activating vaccinia virus-specific CD8 + lymphocytes. Moreover, Nagorsen et al. [26] noted that the efficiency of the vaccine virus vectordelivered vaccine was dependent on the HLA haplotype and the epitopes carried by the vaccine.\n",
            " Non-transmissible pseudorabies virus vectors have been created by deletion of the essential gD required for PRV penetration [29] . Considering that this virus can still spread from cell-to-cell, a biologically safer quadruple glycoprotein-deleted PRV lacking gG, gI and gE was generated [30] . With such PRV vectors, vaccines have been generated encoding proteins from a number of viruses Table 2 .\n",
            " Although the potential of PRV vectors for targeting DC has not been investigated, the reported capacity of PRV to infect and replicate efficiently in macrophages would indicate a tropism for monocytic cells including DC [31] (Fig. 2) . Unfortunately, it has been reported that PRV infection of macrophages is associated with immunological malfunction [32, 33] . In contrast, PRV was seen to be a potent activator of porcine pDC [34] , which would be beneficial for its use as vector. Such results show that the interaction of PRV with cDC and pDC needs further characterization before one can propose this as a vaccine delivery vehicle targeting DC. Indeed, the above results on both poxviruses and PRV demonstrate the need to understand the type and status of the DC being targeted by a vaccine carrier, to ensure the appropriate processing leading to activation of effector immune defences.\n",
            " Adenovirus has been receiving much attention as a vector for delivery of vaccines [35] [36] [37] . Recombinant replication-defective adenoviruses have been generated for a number of porcine pathogens (Table 3 ). These efforts have employed primarily human adenovirus serotype 5 or porcine adenovirus serotype 3, although canine adenovirus type 2 has also been tested. Adenovirus-vectored antigens have also been produced in cell culture and goat milk, for application as recombinant vaccines rather than vectored vaccines [37, 38] .\n",
            " Although porcine adenovirus might appear to be the more obvious candidate of choice, application of human adenovirus does have high potential. Torres et al. [39] analysed the efficiency of this vector for targeting cells and organs of vaccinated pigs. They found adenovirus antigen associated with epithelial cells of bronchioles, macrophages, type II pneumocytes, and follicular dendritic cells. However, it was unclear whether these adenovirus-positive cells were accommodating replicating virus -therefore with the potential for producing the heterologous antigen in a vectored vaccine -or endocytosed antigen produced elsewhere.\n",
            " Human adenovirus have also been engineered to express immunostimulatory cytokines, for promoting innate resistance against infection. A successful example of this is vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV); a recombinant human adenovirus expressing FMDV P1 capsid precursor protein and 3C protease was co-administered with an adenovirus expressing porcine IFN-a [40] . This is particularly intriguing considering the importance of type I IFN to the maturation of cDC and in the development of innate responses following vaccination [41] .\n",
            " The mechanism by which adenoviruses may interact with DC can be inferred from studies employing human monocytes/ macrophages, human cell lines and murine bone marrow-derived DC (Fig. 2) . Moreover, the immunomodulatory capacity of adenoviruses has been demonstrated using murine bone mar- [194] row-derived DC, in terms of maturation of the DC [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] , phenotypic modification [42, 47, 48] , and cytokine induction [42, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . Related to this, Miller et al. [43] noted that the induced maturation of DC depended on virus entry rather than transcription of the viral genome, while Molinier-Frenkel et al. [44] identified the penton capsomer and the fibre protein (and its knob domain) as major inducers of DC maturation. Bontkes et al. [50] found that adenovirus alone was poor at infecting human pDC. In contrast, Basner-Tschakarjan et al. [46] were able to transduce murine bone marrow-derived (with Flt3-L) cDC and pDC with adenovirus, leading to cell maturation and production of IFN-a. This effect was observed in the pDC only when TLR9-dependent signalling was engaged. Such discriminatory results from adenovirus interaction with DC subsets may relate to the receptors required by different adenovirus serotypes, or differences between rodents and humans (see the comment in the next paragraph concerning CD46 expression). Interestingly, the targeting of adenovirus to human DC was enhanced when the virus was engineered to express CD40L on its capsid [51] . Bontkes et al. [50] also used a CD40 targeting approach to improve virus interaction with the DC; although this did not improve transduction efficiency, it did increase the maturation of the pDC.\n",
            " The most straightforward approach for targeting vaccines to DC would be to employ virus vectors known to interact with a particular receptor on the DC. In this context, adenoviruses have a clear application. Receptors have been identified on human DC, as well as human or murine monocytes and macrophages, with which particular adenoviruses can interact. However, an initial problem was realised when the major cell receptor for virus binding was characterized as the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) [52] . Despite being a widely expressed cell adhesion molecule, this receptor has not been found on DC or monocytic cell populations [53, 54] . In contrast, another receptor -CD46 -is expressed on DC [55, 56] . However, CD46 is employed by subgroup B adenoviruses such as adenovirus 35 . Subgroup C adenoviruses such as the widely applied vaccine vector adenovirus 5, as well as canine adenovirus type 2 vaccine vector, employ CAR [54] [55] [56] . Nevertheless, the work with CD46 has shown its importance as a receptor for vaccine targeting, being present on many subtypes of human DC. Interestingly, it is not expressed on murine DC [57] .\n",
            " This variation among adenovirus subtypes with respect to receptor targeting would create uncertainty about the application of vectors such as the commonly employed adenovirus 5. Yet, such vaccines have proven successful in pigs (see Table 3 ). One explanation may be that the adenovirus vector targeted cells other than DC, such as epithelial cells expressing CAR. Alternatively, the vector may have used receptors other than CAR and CD46 on DC. Integrins such as the complement receptor CR3 [58] , and glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulphate structures on the cell surface [59] may also function as adenovirus receptors. In addition, certain adenoviruses can employ a v integrins for interacting with cells, at least cell lines [60, 61] and human monocytes and macrophages [59] .\n",
            " When considering adenovirus targeting of cells, it is important to bear in mind that the virus interaction with cell surface receptors is not a single event. Adenovirus can bind to cells via its fibre protein, after which the viral penton base interacts with cellular integrins such as a v b 3 and a v b 5 to promote virus entry.\n",
            " This role of the penton base appears to be dependent on the RGD motifs in the five identical subunits, at least with cells lines [60, 61] .\n",
            " Involvement of the a v integrins may be more important for virus internalisation than for attachment to the cell [60] . Yet, modifying the viral fibre knob of adenovirus type 5 to carry an RGD motif results in enhanced infectivity for murine DC [62] . While the interaction of the virus fibre protein is clearly important for binding to cell lines, penton base interaction with a M b 2 integrin is important for binding to human monocytes and macrophages [58] .\n",
            " Akin to attachment via the fibre knob, interaction with a M b 2 integrin still required the additional step involving a v integrins for virus internalisation.\n",
            " In addition to the integrins as targets for adenovirus, interaction with cell surface glycosaminoglycan structures can occur. This may be particularly pertinent when considering that a v integrins are more efficiently expressed following activation of monocytes, macrophage or DC. Wickham et al. [59] demonstrated that adenovirus type 5 modified to carry a heparan sulphate-binding heptalysine motif were more efficient at transducing human monocytes and macrophages. A candidate heparin-binding KKTK motif was also identified in the third pseudorepeat of the fibre shaft from adenoviruses 2 and 5 [63] . Moreover, many viruses can bind to heparan sulphate structures on cells, particularly following cell culture passage of the virus as is often the case when producing vaccine viruses. However, heparan sulphate structures are rather ubiquitously expressed, and may not be ideal for enhancing DC targeting over interaction with other cell types. On the contrary, CR3 is more restricted to cells of the innate immune system, namely DC, macrophages and monocytes. Indeed, in contrast to adenoviruses type 2 and 5 (subgroup C adenoviruses), adenovirus type 3 (subgroup B) did not require heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans for binding to and infection of cell lines [63] .\n",
            " Modulation of vaccine targeting can be achieved by introducing a ligand on to the vaccine delivery vehicle, to enhance targeting of the desired receptor. Again, adenoviruses provide some interesting examples of the value in this approach. A chimeric adenovirus was created by modifying the subgroup C adenovirus type 5 to carry the subgroup B adenovirus 35 fibre antigen [55] . This increased interaction with human DC up to 100-fold. A similar approach may be achieved by applying short peptide motifs known for their capacity to interact with integrins expressed on DC, as described above in Section 3.3.3 [62] . One disadvantage with this approach is that certain motifs, such as RGD, have the potential to bind with different integrins. Nevertheless, the presence of the RGD motif in chimeric adenovirus penton bases apparently did not influence their interaction with integrins [54] , suggesting an involvement of other structures; perhaps fibre antigens carrying the KKTK motif of the adenovirus 35 would be important [55] . Indeed, Perreau et al. [54] proposed that chimeric viruses could employ the nonintegrin-binding capacity of the canine adenovirus 2 knob in combination with the capacity of the human adenovirus 5 to interact with integrins.\n",
            " How different targeting events would influence DC handling of a vaccine is dependent on the cell receptor being targeted. Indeed, human adenovirus 5 and canine adenovirus 2 appear to be endocytosed into distinct intracellular compartments [54] . The roles of different receptors leading to distinct compartmentalisation within the cell, as well as the influence of multiple receptor involvement, are important considerations when analysing the potential for targeting vaccines to DC. While there is information concerning the binding of particular vaccines to DC, there is less information on the endocytic route taken thereafter. This is unfortunate, because the endocytic process will determine if an antigen is released (for interaction with B lymphocytes), processed through MHC Class II (for Th lymphocytes), or processed via the immunoproteasome for presentation in association with MHC Class I (for Tc lymphocytes). The endocytic pathway employed will also determine if genetic information carried by a viral vector vaccine is translated into protein. These are important issues, which will be raised again later during discussion of C-type lectin receptor targeting.\n",
            " Canine parvovirus is reported to interact with the transferrin receptor (TfR) [64] (Fig. 2) . This is referred to as an asymmetric binding where only a few receptor molecules (5 AE 2 TfR dimmers) can bind per capsid. The authors suggested that the asymmetric binding of TfR might be due to the virus possessing only one unique site with the conformation for binding to the TfR. Alternatively, the binding of the virus to the TfR might induce the asymmetry. Whatever the mechanism, this binding differs from that associated with picornavirus infection, in which up to 60 sites on the icosahedron can be involved [65] .\n",
            " Numerous non-enveloped viruses, including FMDV, are known for their potential to interact with heparan sulphate structures on cell surfaces [66] [67] [68] [69] . Heparan sulphate structures on DC are important for binding cell-culture passaged FMDV, relating to vaccine viruses [70] (Fig. 2) . This virus also carries ligands for integrin receptors [71] : avb1 [72] , avb3 [73, 74] ) avb6 [71] , and avb8 [72] . However, it appears that the preferred integrins for virus binding are either not expressed or are poorly expressed on the DC [70] . Whether ligation of heparan sulphate structures is the best target remains to be elucidated.\n",
            " Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has also generated interest with respect to DC targeting. In addition, TGEV has been employed as a vaccine vector; reviewed by Enjuanes et al. [75] . TGEV efficiently induces IFN production by pDC [41, [76] [77] [78] , an ability which is independent of virus replication. Viral pseudoparticles expressing M and E proteins, and resembling intact virions, retained the interferogenic activity of the virus [79] ; neither the virus genome nor the spike (S) protein necessary for infection of cells were essential for IFN induction. The induction of IFN did require virus interaction with the cell surface, but not all virion structures were important. Relating to the above report from Baudoux et al. [79] , Riffault et al. [80] had shown that antibody against the TGEV receptor aminopeptidase N did not prevent the IFN induction; nor was antibody against surface M protein effective. Moreover, reconstructing detergent solubilised virus into virosomes did not reconstitute IFN induction capacity. The authors concluded that the induction of IFN required a complex native envelope protein structure. As such, it has been difficult to identify the receptors involved in this IFN induction, although it does seem certain that the induction is being signalled from interaction with receptors on the pDC surface. Insofar as being applicable for targeting vaccine to DC, one may employ the pseudoparticles expressing M and E proteins [79] .\n",
            " Although influenza virus per se has not been applied as a viral vector, derived virosomes (based on influenza virus envelope plus surface glycoproteins) have high potential. In this context, the virus biology is interesting in terms of DC targeting. Sialic residues on cells, particularly a-2,3 and a-2,6-linked sialic acids, are well established as receptors for influenza viruses. The efficiency of the virosomal vaccine carrier (for example: [81] [82] [83] ) would suggest that a-2,6-linked sialic acids on DC (at least murine and human DC) were the target for such vaccines. Indeed, Angel et al. [84] demonstrated that virosomes interacting with pDC are reliant on sialic acid structures on the cell surface; endocytosis of the virosomes by pDC was inhibited by neuraminidase treatment. However, one also has to consider the targeting of the C-type lectin mannose receptors on DC; Reading et al. [85] demonstrated the importance of the mannose receptor for influenza virus infection of murine macrophages. Nevertheless, sialic acid residues on DC would offer the potential for vaccine targeting, particularly when the vaccine construct carries the haemagglutinin glycoprotein.\n",
            " Another important consideration is the varying phenotype of DC, with respect to DC subsets and particularly DC differentiation and maturation. Sialylated structures on DC are modulated during differentiation or interaction with B cells resulting in an increase in expression of a-2-3-sialylated O-glycans, as well as a-2-6and a-2-3-sialylated N-glycans [86, 87] . Interestingly, such sialylated glycans are important for DC endocytic activity. Maturation of the DC resulted in a reduced expression of the glycans, relating to the reduced endocytic activity of mature DC.\n",
            " An alternative approach to the use of live, non-transmissible, replicating vaccine vectors is the use of virus-like particles (VLP). These lack a viral genome, physically carrying the vaccine antigen of interest within their virion structure. With the foreign (''vaccine'') antigen being within a chimeric structure, replication is no longer necessary. In fact, chimeric vectors can be regarded as ''delivering'' the vaccine in a manner similar to that for an inactivated vaccine. Chimeric viruses based on non-enveloped VLPs can also be defined in terms of structures or sequences interacting with DC receptors. Indeed, it can be seen that the nonenveloped viruses mentioned in Section 3.4 would be candidates for chimeric VLP-based vaccines.\n",
            " There is quite a variety of vectors employed for bearing the antigen of interest (Table 4 ). These range from chimeric peptide constructs to viruses and bacteria [88] [89] [90] [91] . One value of employing non-enveloped virus particles for chimeric constructs is the potential of displaying heterologous antigens, allowing for targeting to the immune system via homologous or heterologous viral ligands for receptors on the DC. Good examples of this approach are the reported applications of porcine parvovirus and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2; Table 4 ), which have been employed for both homologous vaccines [92] and for delivering heterologous epitopes [93] [94] [95] .\n",
            " Biodegradable polymers such as poly(lacticco-glycolic acid) (PLGA) have been applied for protein-based vaccine delivery for over a decade [96] . In addition, polyethyleneimine (PEI) loaded PLGA carriers as well as histidine-rich polymers and lipids have been used for nucleic acid delivery [97] . These polymers offer a main advantage over the vaccine vectors described above in Section 3, as well as those based on other viruses, bacteria or their products. Biodegradable polymers do not induce a strong or durable immune response against themselves. Moreover, they are efficiently degraded into non-toxic metabolites, primarily via the Krebs cycle. Particulate carriers are also flexible in their design, composition and structure, which has led to the demonstration of their high potential as vaccine carriers [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] . The design of these particles has employed a number of components, the main ones being PLGA, PEG-PLGA, PLA, PEG-PLA, hydrophobised cholesterol and polycationic formulations. A list of reviews on this topic is found in Table 5 .\n",
            " Particulate formulations offer a wide applicability for in vivo delivery routes. In addition to their use for parenteral delivery, translocation of nano-and microparticles into systemic immune tissues has been observed after intranasal administration in mice, concomitant with development of immune responses [107] [108] [109] . An important consideration in this respect is the particle size, which appears to be a determinant for the performance of biodegradable particle vaccine delivery [110] . Particulate vaccine delivery has also been successful via the oral route (for example, reviewed by O'Hagan et al. [111] ). Moreover, oral and nasal delivery of chitosan microparticles has been compared with respect to diphtheria vaccine efficacy in mice [109] .\n",
            " Despite these advances and high application value, there is little information on the biological characteristics of DC interaction with and processing of these particle-based vaccines. Moreover, further analyses are required on how such vaccine constructs can activate the ''danger'' recognition by DC necessary for promoting DC maturation and the development of active immunity.

            " The recombinant viruses employed for porcine vaccine delivery (Tables 1-3) can be regarded as nanoparticle-based vaccines. Indeed, the adenovirus vectors are effectively nanoparticles delivering a DNA vaccine. In that context, the capacity of the adenovirus to target particular receptors on the DC offers the potential for defined vaccine targeting to the immune system, which can be taken into the field of the biodegradable particlebased vaccine delivery vehicle (see Section 6 below). Similarly, VLP (Table 4 ) are nanoparticles carrying protein vaccine cargoes, albeit forming an integral part of the viral structure. Indeed, the bacteriophages T4 expressing the FMDV P1 protein (together with the T4 expressing FMDV 3C) have been referred to as a nanoparticle surface gene-protein display system [91] .\n",
            " Insofar as the biodegradable vaccine carriers are concerned, there is much less information on their application for porcine vaccines. This is somewhat surprising considering the extent of their application for human vaccines, and vaccines tested in murine models (see the reviews listed in Table 5 ). Nevertheless, there are a number of articles demonstrating the potential of biodegradable carriers for delivery of porcine vaccines (Table 6 ). These also include chitosan-based nanoparticles to entrap plasmids carrying immunomodulatory CpG-ODN motifs [112, 113] . Elaboration of this approach is seen with the application of chitosan-based nanoparticles carrying plasmids encoding porcine IL-2 [90] or IL-6 [112] . For these purposes, the authors employed the net positive charge of chitosan nanoparticles to entrap the DNA in the chitosan polymer matrix by ionic cross-linking.\n",
            " Zhao et al. [112] tested their delivery system in mice, coadministered with a bivalent vaccine against Pasteurella multocida and classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Their results were encouraging in the context of how the nanoparticle-delivered adjuvant enhanced the development of specific immunity and resistance to challenge infection. It will be interesting to see how this application of nanoparticle-delivered adjuvant functions in the porcine host, particularly considering the differences between murine and porcine immune system. As far as delivery of vaccine antigen is concerned, early results using ovalbumin as a model are showing considerable promise both in vitro with porcine DC (Supplementary Fig. 2 ) and in vivo (Harwood et al., unpublished results).\n",
            " Application of nucleic acid vaccines demonstrates the factors to be considered in the context of particle-delivered vaccines. An important influence is the particle charge. Positively charged particles facilitate association with nucleic acid, and also protein antigens with the appropriate negative charge; via ionic crosslinking with the particles. A major consideration -for both anionic and cationic particles -is that sufficient charge be available for binding the cargo. The particle charge is also important concerning mode and efficiency of delivery in vivo. For example, Macklin et al. [114] successfully employed gold particles for epidermal delivery of a DNA vaccine to immunise pigs against H1N1 influenza virus, using a device for particle-mediated gene transfer to the epidermis [115] . Negatively charged nanoparticle constructs also show high potential for delivery through pig skin [116] . Efficient permeation of pig skin was obtained with the negatively charged particles ranging in size from 50 to 500 nm, leading the authors to propose such nanoparticles as potential delivery vectors for transdermal vaccination.\n",
            " Considering that the nucleic acid must be delivered to the target cell in which it will most efficiently transcribe, strong candidate targets are epithelial, fibroblastic or muscle cells; cells with dividing nuclei would increase the chance of DNA entry into the cell nucleus for transcription. The low rate of nuclear division in DC may restrict their capacity to handle DNA vaccines [117] . Nevertheless, targeting DNA vaccines to DC can be successful when applied via viral and bacterial vectors. For example, adenoviruses targeting DC do promote transcription of their DNA (see Section 3.3); the Salmonella typhimurium vector interacts efficiently with murine DC in vitro, and promotes expression of the encoded antigen both in vitro and in vivo [118, 119] .\n",
            " DNA vaccine processing by DC is less promising when the DNA is applied directly to the DC. Ceppi et al. [117] showed that porcine DC directly transfected with DNA do not translocate the DNA into the nucleus nor permit transcription. Franco et al. [120] , showed uptake of a mycobacterial DNA vaccine by human macrophages and DC, but no apparent nuclear translocation or protein production, though mRNA was detectable in monocytes. Transfected cells could induce PBMC proliferation, but this was obtained with PBMC from patients positive or negative for reactivity against mycobacterial antigens.

            " Following direct intradermal inoculation of mice with DNA vaccine encoding influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP), Bot et al. [121] found both MHC Class II + and MHC Class II À cells carrying the NP antigen. However, MHC Class II is insufficient for defining DC or Langerhans cells. Fibrocytes, which are important for activating cytotoxic T-cells, are also MHC Class II positive; it was interesting that adoptive transfer of the NP + MHC Class II + cells did induce cytotoxic T-cells. Although the authors argued against it, the results do not rule out translocation of endocytosed material, especially considering the capacity of DC to endocytose free antigen and also antigen-producing cells for cross-priming. Indeed, Watkins et al. [122] concluded that EGFP synthesised following DNA vaccination of sheep was leaching out of the skin for associating with DC in the afferent lymph. This was based on observations that both plasmid and protein were found in lymph cells and plasma, but only the protein was detected in lymph DC.\n",
            " A number of groups have sought to improve the consequence of DNA vaccine interaction with DC, mostly in murine models. One approach was to encode DC-activating or DC-recruiting cytokines (reviewed by Kutzler and Weiner [123] ). In these cases, the DC are not necessarily the targets for the vaccine, but become involved by enhanced attraction to the site of antigen production, for endocytosis of the antigens or antigen-producing cells. DC can also be directly activated by DNA vaccines, through CpG motifs in the DNA interacting with TLR9, although Spies et al. [124] showed that such activation can be TLR9-independent.\n",
            " Another approach was to increase the targeting of the encoded antigen rather than the DNA. Indeed, You et al. [125] stated that DC showed a limited capacity for uptake of DNA vaccines. Their solution was to encode an antigen with IgG Fc in a fusion protein for vaccination of mice, promoting interaction with the FcR of the DC. Nchinda et al. [126] and Gu et al. [127] employed similar approaches with mice, using DNA encoding a fusion protein with a single chain Fv antibody specific for the DC receptor DEC 205 [126] , or a fusion protein with heat shock protein as the targeting moiety [127] .\n",
            " The above processes do not consider the targeting of the vaccine by delivery vehicles. In the context of DNA vaccines, much work has been performed using gold particle-based delivery, particularly in mice. Although many of these studies mentioned that DC were the key players in promoting immune response development, the majority did not directly quantify vaccine interaction with the DC. This is a major point of criticism raised by Lauterbach et al. [128] . They sought to elaborate on this question by using DNA constructs for either ubiquitous expression (CMV promoter) or specific expression in DC (CD11c promoter). Following biolistic vaccination of mice with DNA-coated gold particles, both forms of construct efficiently induced antibody responses. However, the DNA encoding for DC-specific expression was insufficient at inducing optimum T lymphocyte responses. Porgador et al. [129] also noted that lymph node cells directly expressing DNA-encoded antigen following vaccination of mice were rare. They did find DC carrying the encoded peptide, leading to the proposal that the DC were involved in cross-priming of material produced by transfected myeloblasts.\n",
            " Gold particles for vaccine delivery can be problematic, due to their non-biodegradability and risk of persistence and toxicity. This is not a problem for biodegradable micro/nanoparticle delivery, which has also been promoted for ''targeting'' DNA vaccines to DC. However, many of these articles use the observation that an immune response was generated against the antigens encoded by the DNA as evidence for targeting of the DC (for example, see the review by Jilek et al. [130] ). This is rather speculative, and cannot be considered as proof. On the other hand, the biodegradable particles themselves do interact efficiently with DC (reviewed by Jilek et al. [130] ). Insofar as DNA vaccine delivery is concerned, the most convincing work comes from in vitro studies using cell lines. Jilek et al. [131] successfully transfected a murine DC line with PLGA microparticles carrying DNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). However, the number of cells expressing GFP was low, which the authors related to the requirement for DNA to escape the phagosome wherein the PLGA particles would be degraded. This is a critical point considering the cytosolic localisation of phagosomes contrasting with the cellular localisation of DNA transcription machinery. Indeed, Walter and Merkle [132] showed that particle transfection efficiency is low in phagocytic cells compared with non-phagocytic cells.\n",
            " Biodegradable particles can target DC in vivo, as observed with DC and macrophage endocytosis of PLGA microparticles in the spleen [133] and draining lymph nodes [134] of vaccinated mice. However, these authors did not determine if the encoded antigen was expressed in DC or non-immune cells; the particles were found in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. Moreover, Walter and Merkle [132] proposed that application of biodegradable particle-based DNA delivery in vivo is very likely to lead to transfection of non-phagocytic cells such as fibroblasts.\n",
            " Although much of the work to date has been in mice, DNA vaccination has been reported in pigs. Dincer et al. [135] analysed epidermal delivery of DNA-gold particles in pigs and mini-pigs. Antigen expression was detectable as early as 4 h post-vaccination, but it is uncertain if this reflected interaction of the DNA with nonimmune cells. Nevertheless, one can conclude that particle-based DNA vaccination can be successful in pigs. Application of DNAloaded PLGA microparticles may have a future for porcine vaccination considering the promise shown from studies in mice, guinea pigs, non-human primates and humans (reviewed by Jilek et al. [130] ). While these particles can be targeted to DC, and certain DC may well be capable of allowing DNA transcription, particle-based delivery of DNA vaccines would be improved by targeting non-immune cells. Both Walter and Merkle [132] and Porgador et al. [129] suggested that the cells directly targeted by the particles for DNA transcription may be non-phagocytic cells.\n",
            " One may also consider the reported differences seen with processing of DNA and RNA by DC [117] . This work would suggest that RNA vaccines have a higher potential for biodegradable particle-based delivery to DC. Certainly, DC will accommodate RNA translation and promote processing of the derived protein for induction of specific immunity [70] . It will therefore be interesting to see how the work advances on biodegradable nanoparticles enhancing the uptake of RNA by porcine DC (Supplementary Fig. 3 ).\n",
            " 5. Targeting vaccines to DC: potential for biodegradable particle targeting\n",
            " There have been a number of reports on vaccine carriers targeting DC, but primarily in the murine and human field. Gamvrellis et al. [136] reviewed a number of vaccine constructs which could facilitate uptake by DC. In order to pursue this topic with respect to targeting vaccines to porcine DC, it is necessary to appreciate the advances made in the murine and human fields.\n",
            " Current work is seeking to characterize how DC interact with vaccine carriers, particularly the biodegradable nanoparticle carriers. These have a high potential for application across a number of species and for different vaccines. This is due to their uptake relying on relatively ''simple'' components such as ionic charge, carbohydrate moieties in the particle structure, or particle size, rather than peptide-based (or lipoprotein-or glycoproteinbased) entities as is the case with many viral vectors. Moreover, biodegradable particles lend themselves more readily to modification, in both design and ''decoration'' to carry specific ligands for targeting DC receptors (Fig. 1) .\n",
            " Biodegradable particle structure has been modified and analysed in terms of how this influences DC endocytosis and intracytoplasmic delivery of the vaccine cargos. Not only can they be employed as carriers of protein and nucleic acid-based vaccines (Tables 5 and 6 ), but also as carriers of the adjuvant (Table 6 ). When the two approaches can be combined, an efficient mutual targeting of vaccine and adjuvant may be achievable. When targeting a vaccine to DC, it is necessary to concomitantly deliver a ''danger'' signal to promote activation and maturation of the DC system. Dependent on the ''danger'' signal, it may be desirable to co-deliver this with the vaccine in the same particle, or to use two different particles-one for the vaccine (targeting for example cDC) and one for the adjuvant (targeting for example pDC).\n",
            " When attempting concomitant delivery of vaccine and adjuvant to the DC, it is likely that DNA vaccines would not be the appropriate vaccine choice-protein or RNA vaccines may have greater potential. RNA vaccines also need to target cells, but unlike DNA do not require a dividing nucleus for translation of their encoded genes into protein. DC can certainly accommodate RNA translation, as witnessed when DC are transfected with RNA encoding the complete genomic sequence of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) [137] or FMDV [70] ). Unfortunately, RNA does not efficiently enter DC without assistance [137] . Electroporation or lipofection [70, 117] do allow ''delivery'' of the RNA, but these are not applicable of techniques for in vivo application, except if one relates lipofection to the application of liposomes for vaccine delivery. In this respect, nanoparticles offer a high potential for RNA delivery to DC, as they do for DNA delivery to epithelial or muscle cells.\n",
            " The element which must be considered when applying nanoparticles for targeting protein or RNA vaccines to DC is the influence of targeting on the cellular site of vaccine delivery. Protein is ideally delivered into an acidifying endosomal system, to promote its processing for presentation in association with MHC Class II to Th lymphocytes. For processing in association with MHC Class I, leading to activation of Tc lymphocytes, a different intracellular localisation is required. In the case of RNA, a cytosolic delivery is required, to ensure that the delivered RNA is not degraded by cellular RNases. PLGA particles are reported to escape from endosomes, delivering their payloads into the cytoplasm [138, 139] . Nevertheless, the processes of cellular uptake, retention and processing are not well characterized for particulate vaccine delivery vehicles interacting with DC. This is certainly the case for particles decorated to target and/or activate PRR on the DC. How this would influence delivery to intracellular compartments is of pertinence when choosing the targeting ligand. A good example is the comparison of material delivered through ligation of the DEC205 receptor compared with ligation of the mannose receptor. Targeting DEC205 can lead to antigen recycling through late endosomes, whereas ligation of the mannose receptor may promote more of a recycling process through the peripheral endosomal compartment [15] .\n",
            " A simple approach for DC targeting is the application of antibodies against defined DC receptors. While this has clear potential as a targeting ligand, the overall applicability of such an approach is less certain, whether that be for human or porcine vaccines. Heterologous antibody risks inducing an immune response from the host, while isologous antibody can pose problems when in immune complexes with the vaccine. For the latter, one has to consider removing the Fc portion of the antibody, or preventing its interaction with FcR on cells of the innate immune defences. Nevertheless, antibody interacting with the vaccine carrier would have a role to play, as is the case during the natural humoral responses against an antigen: Immune complex formation would push the equilibrium of the immune response towards memory development.\n",
            " An example of antibody-based DC-targeting is seen with the Siglec (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin superfamily lectin) receptors, primarily expressed on cells of the immune system [140] . Siglecs bind specific glycan structures containing sialic acid [141, 142] . When murine pDC were targeted with ovalbumin conjugated to anti-Siglec-H antibody [143] , an efficient endocytosis of the ovalbumin was observed, leading to stimulation of CD8 + T lymphocytes. The Siglec-5 receptor can also be targeted with specific antibody for enhanced endocytosis. Anti-Siglec-5 (Fab) 2 fragments mediated rapid uptake into early endosomes of human monocytes [144] .\n",
            " One should note that the Siglec family is distributed throughout the immune system, but many are actually inhibitory receptors, carrying immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM). Siglec-10 is one such receptor on human DC [145] , as is Siglec-7 on human DC and monocytes [146] . In contrast, Siglec-H actually lacks tyrosine-based signaling motifs in its cytoplasmic tail, functioning as an efficient endocytic receptor on murine pDC and macrophages, as observed with anti-Siglec-H antibody targeting [143] . Siglec-15 is another receptor of this family which does not carry an ITIM, being expressed on human macrophages and DC [147] . Lysine residues in its transmembrane domain interact with DNAX activation proteins DAP12 and DAP10. Interestingly, Siglec-15 expression appears to be conserved among species [147] .\n",
            " Another important characteristic of the Siglec expression on DC is the modulation associated with maturing cells, a modulation also noted with another glycan-binding DC receptor family, the bgalactoside-binding galectins [148] . Maturation-dependent modulation is also seen with the expression of C-type lectin receptors on DC [149] . In contrast to many of the galectin and Siglec reactions [148] , the expression of C-type lection receptors is downregulated as the DC mature, a phenomenon related to reduced antigen uptake by maturing DC [149] . C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN have also been targeted using specific antibodies, in murine and primate models for vaccine delivery (for example [150, 151] ).\n",
            " In addition to using antibody against DC receptors for vaccine targeting, a number of ligands for particular receptors have been identified, which offer potential for vaccine targeting. Siglec-15 preferentially recognizes Neu5Aca2-6GalNAca [147] . Galectins bind glycoconjugates containing b-galactose structures [148, 152] .\n",
            " However, it is uncertain how vaccine particles interacting with different Siglecs would signal the DC, and how this would influence the outcome of vaccine handling by the cells. Interaction of a vaccine with a Siglec carrying an ITIM would not necessarily be detrimental for vaccine targeting, because it is not yet certain how DC would respond to vaccines using Siglec ligands for targeting purposes. For example, Siglec-10, which carries an ITIM, is reported to bind human red blood cells and soluble sialoglycoconjugates [145] . The Siglec-H, which lacks tyrosine-based signaling motifs, is endocytosed leading to the processing and presentation of captured antigens [153] . Yet, this Siglec signals intracellularly via the DAP12 adaptor with which it is associated, leading to reduced pDC responses against TLR ligands. Siglec-15 also signals via DAP12 and DAP10, but it has been suggested that this signaling implies delivery of activating signals to the cell [147] . Another receptor, Siglec-1 (CD169), is reported to be the receptor for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) binding to and internalisation by porcine macrophages [154] . Considering that virus interaction with this receptor would lead to internalisation, targeting Siglec-1 may prove a useful vaccine targeting strategy. Siglec-1 is also expressed by DC, being upregulated on mature cells, along with Siglec-2 and Siglec-7 as well as two of the galectins-galectin-3 and galectin-8 [148] .\n",
            " There are also a number of ligands defined for C-type lectin receptors -such as DC-SIGN -which would provide useful targeting moieties. Examples of these are the GlcNac(b1-3)-Gal(b1-4)-Glc-R oligosaccharide forming the outer core of Neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide [155] , and Gal(b1-4)(Fuc(a1-3))GlcNAc and Fuc(a1-3)Gal(b1-4)(Fuc(a1-3))GlcNAc determinants relating to the glycosphingolipids of Schistosoma mansoni [156] . With respect to the studies on Neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide interaction with DC-SIGN [155] , mannan and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) were found to interfere with bacterial binding. Mannan, including oxidized and reduced derivatives, enhanced antigen targeting to and endocytosis by DC. This resulted in an activation of the DC and immune response induction in vivo, at least in the mouse [157] . Moreover, the differential application of the oxidized and reduced forms of mannan can favour a more Th1 or Th2 type response, respectively [158] .\n",
            " Certainly, mannan and other mannosylated structures, which can bind to the mannose receptor CD206 as well as DC-SIGN, have been employed for targeting mannose-binding C-type lectins on DC (Table 7) . A number of vaccine antigens also offer this targeting facility, through mannose-containing moieties inherent in their structures. Either these or synthetic structures can be conjugated to the vaccine delivery vehicles, an approach which has found favour with the mannosylation of biodegradable nanoparticle vaccine carriers.\n",
            " Related to the approach with ligands for C-type lectin and Siglec receptors, it is also possible to target other DC receptors, including the TLRs (Fig. 1) important for adjuvant-dependent activation of the cells. Certainly, TLR ligands such as chemically defined lipopeptides have potential as adjuvants [159] . Although lipopeptides have not been reported in terms of vaccine delivery for pigs, lipopeptides and lipoproteins have been tested for their adjuvant potential. These have been employed either as an integral antigenic component of the vaccine [160] [161] [162] , or admixed with the vaccine antigen in a more classical manner [163] . The disadvantage of lipoproteins is that they themselves can be antigenic. In contrast, lipopeptides such as the synthetic compounds based on tri-palmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine (Pam 3 Cys) and di-palmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine (Pam 2 Cys) tend to serve primarily as PAMPs for TLR2 dimers, thus allowing for their application in a more generic sense [164] .\n",
            " Related to this area is the application of lipid-based vaccine carriers, liposomes [165] . Liposomal vaccine delivery and application as an adjuvant have been widely reported for murine and human studies [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] . VLPs can also be constructed to bear lipopeptide surface structures. By inference to the capacity of TLR2 homo-and heterodimers to bind such structures, this allows for potential vaccine targeting and activation of DC [169, 172, 173] .\n",
            " This overview on particulate vaccine targeting to the immune system has presented the current knowledge concerning the relationship between the surface structure of vaccine delivery vehicles and the manner by which DC interact with the particle cargo. Although there is some evidence that vaccine targeting to DC has high potential for porcine vaccines, most of the information comes from inference to work with murine and human DC. Therein, a major effort is being made in the development of both viral and synthetic vaccine carriers. A critically important consideration therein is how receptor ligation influences the characteristics of vaccine interaction with the DC. Whether protein or RNA delivery is being employed, the antigen ultimately present in the DC -delivered by the carrier or translated from the delivered RNA -has to be processed via endosomal recycling and processing. Accordingly, current research on vaccine targeting to DC is seeking to determine the influence of the vaccine delivery vehicle surface decoration on modulation of DC activity. This is linking to the cytosolic localisation of the delivered vaccine cargo, which will be different for a protein cargo compared with an RNA cargo. The key element is to define the manner of targeting to the DC which will promote the appropriate delivery, leading to efficacious immune defence development (Supplementary Fig. 4 ).

            "Body Text:\n",
            " The development of vaccines is one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine. They save millions of lives yearly, not only by giving immunity to people exposed to an infection but also by stopping disease outbreaks. Most famously, perhaps, vaccine drove the eradication of smallpox [1] . At the time of writing, vaccines are the main hope for a pharmaceutical solution to the COVID-19 crisis [2] [3] [4] .\n",
            " To be able to evaluate interventions involving vaccination, we need to model the selection of who gets vaccinated and how that affects epidemics [5] . Creating such models is a very challenging task to which this paper seeks to contribute [6, 7] . The main difficulty lies in the complex feedback mechanisms between the epidemics itself and the decision to get vaccinated [8] [9] [10] . Not only are there irrational antivaccination sentiments that themselves spread through social contagion [11, 12] , but sometimes not getting vaccinated is a perfectly rational choice.\n",
            " When the population level of immunity is high enough, an outbreak will die out by itself. If this is the case, the population is said to have herd immunity. Even if the vaccine is effective, the marginal benefit of getting vaccinated in a society with herd immunity is small [13] . On top of this, a vaccine could be costly, inefficient, laden with side-effects, or inconvenient to administer [14] . For an individual, the reality is often between these extremes and not a choice between a cheap lifesaver or a costly unnecessity. Thus, this choice is known in the literature as the vaccination dilemma [15, 16] .\n",
            " Assume the vaccine is effective but has some side effects (although much milder than the disease itself). Then one can model the rational-choice aspect of vaccination within the framework of game theory [7, 17] . As often is the case, behavioural and economic game theorists both take an interest in this problem, with somewhat different starting points. The behavioural game-theory line of research typically focuses on herd immunity as a public good-something valuable and accessible without competition to anyone in society [9, 10] . Like other public goods, herd immunity is prone to free-riding people who undermine the good by avoiding vaccination [18] . Economic game theorists instead think of vaccination as a decision based on an individual's costs and benefits, and regard herd immunity as a positive externality. The truth lies in between these pictures [8] . Benefiting a public good is not the most common driving force behind an individual's vaccination decisions [19, 20] . It would also make little sense to get vaccinated to contribute to herd immunity if very few others were vaccinated, which is precisely when the private benefits are the largest [13] . On the other hand, herd immunity and, ultimately, eradication of a disease are the primary goals at a national level [3, 4] , and thus more than a mere externality.\n",
            " There is a growing research interest in game-theoretic studies of vaccination [6, 17] . For articles in the economic game-theory literature, see, e.g. Geoffard and Philipson [8] or Francis [13] and further references therein. In the evolutionary game-theory literature, early works coupled game theory and epidemic dynamics by differential-equation-based models [21] . Later, authors recognised that social interaction structures are better modelled by networks. For example, in Fu et al. [15] individuals compare their fitness to randomly selected network neighbours to determine whether or not to imitate the neighbour. The phrases \"fitness\" and \"payoff\" (that in this paper are synonymous) come from the game-theory literature and capture the ability to avoid infection minus the cost associated with the vaccination. Other authors have extended the use of imitation dynamics. Zhang et al. [22] , for example, considered the possibility that decisions are neighbour-dependent by defining an individual's fitness depending on their entire neighbourhood. Zhang et al. [23] and Han et al. [24] studied individuals with memory, calculating an individual's fitness as the weighted average of the past payoffs. Moreover, models by Xia et al. [25] , Ichinose and Kurisaku [26] , and Iwamura and Tanimoto [27] disregarded payoffs altogether in certain situations by allowing individuals to follow the neighbourhood majority with a non-zero probability, or, otherwise, use fitness comparison to decide their action.\n",
            " Our study extends the above models by unifying two ideas. First, when making a vaccination decision based on the performance of their neighbours, individuals can follow different decision rules. Second, an individual can learn by experience and thus change their decision rule as time goes on. We use two empirically observed decision rules. First, individuals can follow the best performer in the extended neighbourhood (the neighbourhood of a focal node and the node itself) [28, 29] . We call such individuals performists. Second, they can also follow the majority in the extended neighbourhood [28] . We will refer to individuals following this strategy as conformists. Furthermore, we will let the individuals chose between these two rationales based on experience. The duration of the individuals' memory is one of the model-parameters we explore. In the remainder of this article, we will go over the technical details of our model, present our simulation results, and discuss the broader implications of our findings.\n",
            " We construct a network-based epidemiological model with vaccination. The model comprises individuals embedded in a social network through which epidemics spread. Probably the closest scenario is that of seasonal influenza. Occasionally, the population has the opportunity of getting vaccinated. Then individuals evaluate the performance of their social surroundings, and, based on this information, decide about their vaccination. They have two ways (imitation mechanisms) of performing this evaluation-the mentioned conformist and performist strategies. The individuals then update these imitation mechanisms based on experience.\n",
            " Each cycle of epidemic outbreaks and vaccinations plays out in three stages. First, individuals choose whether or not to vaccinate following their current strategy and available information. Second, we calculate the expectation value of the outbreak size for the particular configuration of vaccinated nodes. This is done by averaging over 640 runs of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) simulation (discussed further below). Finally, individuals choose between the conformist or performist imitation strategy. We simulate these vaccination cycles over 150 times to reach a steady state.\n",
            " At the beginning of every simulation, we randomly vaccinate 10 % of the population and let a fraction c be conformists (otherwise performists). From the second vaccination, all individuals make decisions following their strategies. We allow the choice of strategy to depend on the experience gathered through vaccination. We assume that individuals choose the imitation mechanism that gives them a larger average payoff over the period of m preceding vaccination cycles. Memory, therefore, plays a key role in determining whether an individual behaves as a conformist or a performist at any given time during a simulation run.\n",
            " For the epidemic simulation, we used the standard Markovian Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) algorithm [30] . This is the canonical model of diseases that make people immune upon recovery. It has nominally two parameters-the infection rate and the recovery rate . However, only sets the time scale of the outbreak, and since we are only interested in the final outbreak size, we can set = 1 without loss of generality. We simulate this model with a fast \"event-driven algorithm\" as described in Kiss et al. [30] and implemented at http://www.githu b.com/pholm e/sir.\n",
            " When the individuals evaluate their performance, they assume a cost c V per vaccination and a cost c I for getting infected. For an approved vaccine, we can assume c V < c I . Accordingly, a vaccinated individual receives the payoff Π i = −c V per vaccination cycle, whereas someone who is not vaccinated gets the payoff Π i = −c I I(i) , where I(i) is the fraction of outbreak simulations when i got infected. We set c V = 0.1 and c I = 1 throughout our study.\n",
            " Both conformists and performists make their decisions deterministically. The former follow the majority with probability 1, whereas the latter pursue a larger payoff with probability 1. This means that, in comparison to probabilistic imitation rules (e.g., the Fermi rule), the selection process is stronger, thus converging faster to evolutionary equilibria. Although considering convergence rates may be of some interest when one strategy is only marginally advantageous over the other, this is not the case herein and would require artificial parameter fine-tuning to occur. An added benefit is that finite-size effects disappear at smaller social-network sizes, thus reducing computational requirements.\n",
            " For underlying interaction topology, we mostly use Erdős-Rényi random graphs with N = 64 nodes and equally many edges. We try other, larger, sizes as well, but these give qualitatively similar results. Since this paper will not concern the largesize limit, to cut computation times, we stick with the smaller systems.\n",
            " We will primarily explore three parameters in our simulations-c, m, andand average the simulations described above over 10 3 simulation runs. We use the OACIS framework [31] to manage our simulations.\n",
            " Time evolution. In Fig. 1 , we show a representative simulation run of the model. We find that the outbreak size cannot be reduced by having a large initial fraction of conformists, irrespective of the memory length (Fig. 1, yellow curves in a, b) . Conversely, if the initial presence of conformists is moderate, the outbreak size is greatly reduced (Fig. 1, blue curves in a, b) . Short memory turns out to have almost no effect on the choice of imitation mechanisms, causing the population to end with a similar fraction of conformists as in the initial state (Fig. 1c) . Increasing memory changes the situation. In this case, the updating of imitation mechanisms increases, allowing the population to converge to a fraction of conformists noticeably different than in the initial state (Fig. 1d ). The population is even able to eliminate outbreaks in the case when the initial fraction of conformists is moderate (Fig. 1, blue curve in panel b) . We confirm that the selected simulation run is indeed representative by averaging across a large number of runs (Fig. 2) , which exhibit the same qualitative characteristics as the described single run. Note that each single run is realised probabilistically, meaning that, for example, conformism at time t = 0 need not be exactly c, but can deviate slightly around this value.\n",
            " Initial conformism. To further clarify the role of initial conformism, we inspect how the outbreak size depends on the infection rate for various values of the parameter c when memory is relatively long (Fig. 3) . At low infection rates, ⪅ 0.5 , the outbreak size is independent of initial conformism. After that, for ⪆ 0.5 , the results diverge. High initial conformism precipitates massive outbreaks, whereas moderate ( 0.4 < c < 0.6 ) and low initial conformism prevent them. Interestingly, the outbreak size is smallest when initial conformism hovers around moderate levels of c. The reason why too much conformism leads to a low vaccination coverage is that too many individuals imitate what they see in their neighbourhoods, and they mostly see (a and b) and the fraction of conformists (c and d) for a short m = 2 (a and c) and a long m = 8 (b and d) memory length. The plots also show two initial fractions of conformists, c = 0.5 (blue curves) and c = 0.9 (yellow curves). The population seems unable (respectively, able) to eventually reduce the outbreak size irrespective of the memory length when the initial fraction of conformists is high (moderate). Short (long) memory seems insufficient (sufficient) to trigger a substantial interchange of imitation mechanisms among individuals compared to the initial state. Long memory thus helps to eliminate outbreaks when the initial fraction of conformists is moderate (blue curve in panel b). Here, the infection rate is relatively large, = 2 . The networks are constructed by the Erdős-Rényi model with N = 64 nodes and the average degree k = 2 , which ensures the existence of a giant component (that essentially all nodes belong to). Time is measured in the number of vaccination cycles Low initial conformism is good, moderate initial conformism is best, and high initial conformism is bad. We show the outbreak size, averaged over the last 50 vaccination cycles, as a function of the infection rate. The three curves correspond to three different levels of initial conformism. Low initial conformism yields good results in terms of the outbreak size, especially at large infection rates ( c = 0.1 ). The results are even better for moderate initial conformism, although the improvement is modest ( c = 0.5 ). If initial conformism is high, however, the outbreak size monotonically increases with the infection rate, and the disease may spread through much of the population ( c = 0.9 ). Here, the memory length is relatively long at m = 8 defection because the starting vaccination coverage is set to 10 %. This particular choice and its implications are further elaborated in the Discussion section.\n",
            " A detailed examination of the phase space reveals that a population of individuals who dynamically interchange imitation mechanisms, as envisioned in our model, often evolves to moderate levels of conformism, but only if memory is long enough (Fig. 4) . The outbreak size is thus reduced in populations with longer memory relative to those with shorter memory, for all infection rates ⪆ 0.5 and irrespective of initial conformism (Fig. 4a, b) . The reason for this reduction is that individuals who keep a shorter track of the past tend to stick to a single imitation mechanism, impeding the evolution of conformism towards moderate levels that help curb the disease (Fig. 4c) . Conversely, individuals who keep a longer track of the past see their population evolve towards the disease-curbing, moderate levels of conformism between 40 and 60 % over a wide area of the phase space, that is, for ⪆ 0.5 and 0.10 ⪅ c ⪅ 0.85 (Fig. 4d) .\n",
            " Memory length. Our results so far have suggested that memory length plays a vital role in shaping the fate of disease outbreaks. We now inspect this role in further detail. In particular, looking at how the population performs as the memory Fig. 4 Updating of imitation mechanisms often leads to disease-curbing, moderate levels of conformism, but only if memory is long enough. We show heatmaps of the outbreak size (a and b) and the fraction of conformists (c and d) as a function of the infection rate and initial conformism. When the infection rate is low, the outbreak size is independent of the initial conformism, which is evident from the horizontal contour curves for ⪅ 0.5 in a and b. As the infection rate increases, however, high initial conformism causes severe outbreaks. Short memory fails to improve the situation because the level of conformism changes little compared to initial conformism, which is seen in the almost vertical contour curves in c. Long memory, by contrast, often improves the situation by adjusting initial conformism to disease-curbing, moderate levels between 40 and 60 %, as seen in d. Every point is averaged over the last 50 vaccination cycles length increases, we find that long memory is better than short, even in situations when initial conformism is in the disease-curbing, moderate range (Fig. 5) . The effect is even more pronounced when initial conformism is outside of the moderate range (Fig. 6a) , the reason being that long memory, characterised by m > 4 , entices a substantial dynamical interchange of imitation rules when the infection rate is The three curves correspond to three different memory lengths. The outbreak size for infection rates ⪆ 0.5 gets progressively smaller as the memory length increases. Here, initial conformism is moderate at c = 0.5 Fig. 6 The level of conformism evolves only if memory is long enough and initial conformism is not moderate. In a and b, we show heatmaps of the outbreak size. In c and d, we show the fraction of conformists as the functions of the infection rate and the memory length. As before, when the infection rate is low, the outbreak size is independent of the memory length, which can be seen by the horizontal contour curves for ⪅ 0.5 in a and b. As the infection rate increases, however, short memory precipitates severe outbreaks under non-moderate a, but not under moderate initial conformism b. The reason for this is seen in c in which short memory, m < 3 , fails to substantially change the level of conformism, whereas long memory, m > 4 , drives conformism to moderate levels between 40 and 60 % (for ⪆ 0.5 ). d A population starting with moderate initial conformism also ends with similar conformism levels between 40 and 60 %, irrespective of the parameters and m sufficiently large ( ⪆ 0.5 ), thus driving the level of conformism to evolve to moderate values between 40 and 60 % (Fig. 6c) . Short memory, characterised by m < 3 , cannot achieve the same as initial conformism is largely preserved throughout simulation runs (Fig. 6c) . That moderate conformism indeed curbs the disease effectively is revealed by simulation runs for c = 0.5 because in this case, the outbreak size (Fig. 6b ) is always small, while the final level of conformism is still between 40 and 60 % (Fig. 6d) , independent of the infection rate and the memory length. An alternative way to understand our results is in terms of the basic reproduction number, R 0 , and its effective counterpart, R e . In the model, vaccination makes a certain fraction of individuals immune even before the onset of an epidemic. The effective reproduction number is therefore right from the start R e = R 0 (1 − VC) , where VC stands for the vaccination coverage. Although the case of = 0.5 has a lower R 0 value than the case of, say, = 3 , the epidemic is felt much more strongly in the latter case, and consequently, the evolutionary dynamics drives the population to embrace vaccination (giving rise to a much larger VC ). The end result is that the effective reproduction number, as well as the outbreak size, is much lower for = 3 than = 0.5.\n",
            " Network structure. To confirm that the described results are robust to the choice of network structure, we have run additional simulations on two-dimensional square lattices and scale-free networks. Interestingly, only the former structure exhibits any noteworthy differences compared to the Erdős-Rényi networks. Our previous observation that a longer memory length reduces the outbreak size as the infection rate increases is valid for all networks structures (Fig. 7a, b) . The square lattice quantitatively differs from the Erdős-Rényi network in that the former has a much larger diameter which, for a given infection rate, impedes disease outbreaks. This, in turn, somewhat weakens the effect of long memory on suppressing diseases. Indeed, a longer memory always leads to more vaccination coverage, but such coverage is much smaller in the lattice than in the Erdős-Rényi network when infection rates are relatively large (Fig. 7c, d) . Individuals thus have an easier time learning the best course of action to combat epidemics in tighter, more compact networks.\n",
            " We have constructed a model of vaccination-based in equal proportions on game theory, network epidemiology, and models of social influence-in which individuals in addition to deciding whether to vaccinate or not, also have the option to choose a preferred imitation mechanism. Individuals called conformists thus rely on a simple heuristic by which they imitate the behaviour of the neighbourhood majority. Performists, by contrast, imitate neighbours that perform the best in terms of payoff. The results show that the dynamic interchange of these imitation mechanisms suppresses disease outbreaks through better vaccination. Two notable phenomena are that (i) too much initial conformism in the population and (ii) short memory of individuals are obstructive for the vaccination coverage.\n",
            " As mentioned before, the reason why too much conformism leads to a low vaccination coverage is that too many individuals imitate what they see in their neighbourhoods, and they mostly see defection. This, in turn, is because our simulations start with the initial vaccination coverage of 10 %, which is a valid starting point from the perspective of novel vaccine acceptance. Such an angle is relevant at the time of writing. On the one hand, we are amidst a pandemic (COVID- 19) for which vaccines seem like the best hope for a solution [2] [3] [4] . On the other hand, recent years have seen a trend of increasing vaccine hesitancy [10, 20, 32] . This trend could partly be explained by the kind of mix of rational thinking and predisposition to following the crowd as is manifested by the conformists [11, 33] . However, probably it would be more appropriate to extend our model to include zealots-individuals who do not let the dynamics of the game to affect their choices [14, 18] .\n",
            " The other notable phenomenon revealed by our model, specifically, that more extended memory helps boost the vaccination coverage, is suggestive in the sense that educational measures could be used to bolster the collective awareness of the Our observation that a longer memory length decreases the outbreak size as the rate of infection increases is valid irrespective of the network structure. Quantitative differences between networks arise because the lattice has a large diameter that impedes outbreaks given the same infection rate. Initial conformism is c = 0.50 . The number of nodes is N = 64 role of vaccines in controlling infectious diseases [19] . Classrooms are an ideal setting to raise awareness about the burden of infectious diseases as well as the success of vaccines in limiting these [1, 34] . An immediate reason for suggesting measures to bolster collective awareness is that past events tend to be entirely forgotten, or at least, their perceived importance diminishes with the passage of time. The model could account for the effects of human forgetfulness by adding weights to memory such that more distant past decisions contribute less to present decisions. The suggested educational measures would then have the effect of keeping the weights larger overall. A difficulty with this approach is a lack of basis for assigning concrete numerical values to the weights, which perhaps could be overcome by means of behavioural experiments. Finally, we note that in our simulations, the individuals learn strategies to make the vaccination choice. This means they are manifesting \"wisdom of crowds\" [35] i.e., that populations can perform distributed computation tasks, integrating information without central control.\n",

            " The current pandemic of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights an urgent need to develop a safe, efficacious, and durable vaccine. Using a measles virus (rMeV) vaccine strain as the backbone, we developed a series of recombinant attenuated vaccine candidates expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) and evaluated their efficacy in cotton rat, IFNAR −/− mice, IFNAR −/− -hCD46 mice, and golden Syrian hamsters. We found that rMeV expressing stabilized prefusion S protein (rMeV-preS) was more potent in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies than rMeV expressing full-length S protein (rMeV-S), while the rMeVs expressing different lengths of RBD (rMeV-RBD) were the least potent. Animals immunized with rMeV-preS produced higher levels of neutralizing antibody than found in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients and a strong Th1-biased T cell response. The rMeV-preS also provided complete protection of hamsters from challenge with SARS-CoV-2, preventing replication in lungs and nasal turbinates, body weight loss, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. These data demonstrate that rMeV-preS is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate, supporting its further development as a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 vaccine | measles virus vector | prefusion spike I n December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) was first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China. The causative agent was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic (1) (2) (3) . It spread rapidly within China and swept into at least 200 countries within 3 mo. Symptoms are primarily pneumonia, as with two other important human coronaviruses (CoVs), SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (1-3). As of 1 February 2021, more than 102,399,513 cases had been reported worldwide, with 2,217,005 deaths (∼2.2% mortality). There is an urgent need to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine to protect the populace from this new virus. Globally, more than 300 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are in preclinical development (4) (5) (6) and at least 30 vaccine candidates have entered human clinical trials (4, 5, 7, 8) . Among them, vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA), inactivated virus, and adenovirus vectors (Ad5-nCoV and ChA-dOx1) are now in phase III clinical trials. Excitingly, preliminary results indicate that these vaccines are highly efficacious, reaching 90 to 95% effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection in some cases. The durability of the protection conferred by these vaccine candidates is unknown. Although these vaccine candidates are highly promising, exploration of other vaccine platforms is needed.\n",
            " The CoV spike (S) protein is the main target for neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection and prevent disease. As such, the S protein is the primary focus for CoV vaccine development (9, 10) . The CoV S protein is a class I fusion protein trimer that is incorporated into virions as they bud into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. For SARS-CoV-2, S is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by furin before the virion is Significance Measles virus (MeV) vaccine is one of the safest and most efficient vaccines with a track record in children. Here, we generated a panel of rMeV-based vaccines with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) S antigens inserted near 3′ of the MeV genome. The rMeV expressing a soluble stabilized, prefusion spike (preS) is much more potent in triggering SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody than rMeV-based full-length S vaccine candidate. A single dose of rMeV-preS is sufficient to induce high levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in animals. Furthermore, rMeV-preS induces high levels of Th1-biased immunity. Hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Our results demonstrate rMeV-preS is a safe and highly efficacious bivalent vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 and MeV.\n",

The S2 subunit is further cleaved by TMPRSS2 (or cathepsin L/B) and possesses the membrane-fusing activity (9, 11, 12) . Both S and its RBD have been shown to be immunogenic for many CoVs (13) (14) (15) . The native S in the virion is in its \"prefusion\" form. Upon triggering, the prefusion S (preS) undergoes significant conformational changes to insert its fusion peptide into the target cell membrane and bring the virion and cell membranes together, arriving at its postfusion S form as it causes the membranes to fuse. For paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, and HIV, it has been shown that prefusion forms of glycoprotein are more potent in inducing neutralizing antibodies than their postfusion forms (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Currently, whether the SARS-CoV-2 preS protein is more immunogenic than the postfusion S protein is unknown.\n",
            " Live attenuated measles virus (MeV) vaccine has been one of the safest and most efficient human vaccines and has been used in children since the 1960s (21, 22) . Worldwide MeV vaccination campaigns have been very successful in controlling measles. MeV is an enveloped nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Morbillivirus within the Paramyxoviridae family. MeV is an excellent vector to deliver vaccines for human pathogens primarily because of its high safety, efficacy, and longlived immunity (22, 23) . MeV has previously been shown to be a highly efficacious vaccine vector for many viral diseases such as HIV (24, 25) , SARS-CoV-1 (26, 27) , MERS-CoV (28, 29) , respiratory syncytial virus (30) , hepatitis B and C viruses (31) , influenza virus (30, 32) , chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (33) , and flaviviruses (Zika virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus) (34) (35) (36) .\n",
            " Recent human clinical trials have demonstrated that an recombinant MeV (rMeV)-based CHIKV vaccine is safe and highly immunogenic in healthy adults, even in the presence of preexisting anti-MeV vector immunity (33) .\n",
            " In this study, we developed a series of rMeV-based vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and evaluated them in cotton rats, IFNAR −/− mice, IFNAR −/− -hCD46 mice, and golden Syrian hamsters. We found that all SARS-CoV-2 S antigens are highly expressed by the MeV vector. Among these vaccine candidates, rMeV expressing stabilized preS (rMeV-preS) and full-length S (rMeV-S) proteins were the most potent in triggering SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Animals immunized with rMeV-preS induced the highest level of neutralizing antibodies that were higher than convalescent sera of patients recovered from COVID-19, and the highest Th1-biased T cell immune response. Furthermore, hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS provided complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge and lung pathology. The codon optimized full-length S, preS, S-dTM, S1, RBD1, RBD2, and RBD3 were amplified by PCR and inserted into the same position at the gene junction between P and M in the genome of the MeV Edmonston vaccine strain. The domain structure of S protein is shown: SP, signal peptide; RBD, receptor-binding domain; RBM, receptor-binding motif; FP, fusion peptide; HR, heptad repeat; CH, central helix; TM, transmembrane domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail. The organization of negative-sense MeV genome is shown.

(B) The plaque morphology of rMeV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S antigens. All plaques were developed after 5 d of incubation in Vero CCL-81 cells. (C) Multistep growth curve. Confluent Vero CCL81 cells in 12-well plates were infected with each virus at an MOI of 0.01. After 1 h of absorption, fresh DMEM with 2% fetal bovine serum was added. The cell culture supernatants and cell lysates were harvested and combined, and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. Data are geometric mean titers (GMT) ± SD from n = 3 biologically independent experiments. (D and E) Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S and S1 protein expression in cell lysate and supernatants by Western blot. Vero We have developed a yeast-based recombination system for rapidly constructing complementary DNA (cDNA) clones of rMeV expressing foreign genes such as the SARS-CoV-2 S antigens. Six overlapping DNA fragments (designated a to f) spanning the full-length MeV Edmonston vaccine strain and a SARS-CoV-2 gene annealing to the junction between the P and M genes were ligated into the pYES2 vector in a single step mediated by DNA recombinases present in yeast (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). Using this strategy, we constructed a series of rMeV vaccine vectors expressing eight variants of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein: 1) full-length S (S), 2) deletion of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail reflecting the soluble ectodomain (S-dTM), 3) S1 subunit (S1), 4) three different lengths of RBD (RBD1, RBD2, and RBD3) of S, and 5) a prefusion-stabilized soluble ectodomain with deletion of the furin cleavage site, two proline mutations (amino acids 986 and 987), and a self-trimerizing T4 fibritin trimerization motif replacing its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (preS) (9) (Fig. 1A) . All rMeV viruses were recovered from full-length genome cDNAs using the standard reverse genetics system and plaque-purified. To confirm that the recombinant viruses indeed contained the target gene, viral genomic RNA was extracted followed by RT-PCR using primers annealing to the flanking MeV P and M genes. PCR products were sequenced, confirming that S and its variants were inserted into the MeV genome between the P and M genes. Finally, the entire genome of each recombinant virus was sequenced to confirm that no additional mutations had been introduced. Compared to the parental rMeV, all recombinant viruses formed relatively smaller plaques (Fig. 1B) and exhibited delayed syncytia formation and cytopathic effects (CPE) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ). A multistep replication curve showed that these recombinant viruses had delayed replication kinetics in Vero CCL81 cells (Fig. 1C) . However, the peak titer of rMeV-S1 (10 7.2 plaque-forming units [PFU]/mL) was higher than that of the parental rMeV (10 6.9 PFU/mL). Three recombinant viruses (rMeV-RBD1, RBD2, and RBD3) grew to titers comparable to the parental rMeV in Vero CCL-81 cells, whereas rMeV-S and rMeV-preS had 0.3 to 0.5 log reductions in peak titer. These results suggest that insertion of near-full-length SARS-CoV-2 S genes into the MeV genome further attenuates MeV replication.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 S Proteins Are Highly Expressed by the rMeV Vector. We examined the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins by rMeV in confluent Vero CCL81 cells inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Cell culture supernatants and lysates were harvested at 72 and 96 h postinfection and analyzed by Western blot using antibody against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein or MeV N protein. As expected, two proteins with molecular weights of 190 and 95 kDa were detected in rMeV-S-infected cells at 72 h, reflecting the full-length S and cleaved S1 (Fig. 1D ). In rMeV-preS-infected cells, the 180-kDa uncleaved, stabilized preS protein was detected, somewhat smaller because it lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. In rMeV-S1-infected cells, the 95-kDa S1 protein was detected. The preS and S1 but not the full-length S were also secreted into the culture medium. By 96 h postinfection protein expression had increased (Fig. 1D ). Although the S1 subunit from rMeV-S-infected cells had not been detected in the supernatant at 72 h, it was at 96 h ( Fig. 2E ). At both times, much of the S protein had been cleaved to its active form but the release of S1 into the supernatant at the later time suggests that some of the metastable cleaved S protein had either triggered spontaneously or following engagement with its receptor on a neighboring cell. Triggering releases S1 and allows S2 to refold, engaging with the target cell membrane and causing fusion between the two membranes. RBD1 (34 kDa), RBD2 (40 kDa), and RBD3 (45 kDa) proteins were produced by their respective rMeV vector-infected cells (Fig. 2F ), consistent with their predicted molecular weights. High levels of RBD1 and RBD2 were secreted into the cell culture supernatant. These results demonstrated that all of these SARS-CoV-2 S antigens were highly expressed by the rMeV vector, with the exception of S-dTM (Fig. 2E) , which was not pursued further. The extensive fusion CPE observed at both 72 and 96 h (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ) is most likely due to MeV, which causes this type of CPE. Interestingly, the CPE did not impair the production of most versions of the S protein over the 96 h of the experiment.\n",
            " rMeV-Expressed S and preS Are Highly Immunogenic in Cotton Rats.\n",
            " Cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) are a susceptible model for MeV infection (37) . Thus, we first tested the immunogenicity of these rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates in cotton rats ( Fig. 2A) . Four-week-old specific-pathogen-free cotton rats were immunized subcutaneously with 4 × 10 5 PFU of each rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate and boosted with 2 × 10 6 PFU of the same vaccine candidate 4 wk later. Sera were collected at weeks 4, 6, and 8, and S-specific antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using preS protein as the antigen. By week 4, all five cotton rats in the rMeV-preS group had developed S-specific antibodies, whereas only three out of five cotton rats in the rMeV-S group had (Fig. 2B ). However, antibodies were detectable at the lowest dilution in most cotton rats in the rMeV-S1 and RBD1-3 groups. After the booster immunization, antibodies in the rMeV-preS group were uniformly high, whereas three cotton rats in rMeV-S had high antibody titers and two had low antibody titers. Despite the booster immunization, antibody titers in the rMeV-S1 group remained low and antibody titers in rMeV-RBD1-3 were at the minimum detectable level (Fig. 2B) .\n",
            " The functional activities of the antibodies in sera from the two groups with the most antibody to S, rMeV-S and rMeV-preS, were tested for their ability to neutralize live SARS-CoV-2, in comparison to the rMeV group. Neutralizing antibody titers in the rMeV-preS group were significantly higher than those in the rMeV-S group (P < 0.05), on average 5.5-fold higher (Fig. 2C) . Therefore, in the MeV expression system, preS is the most effective immunogen for inducing neutralizing antibodies in the cotton rat.\n",
            " rMeV-preS Is Highly Immunogenic in IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 Mice and Induces High Levels of Th1-Biased T Cell Immune Responses. MeV vaccine strains can use several receptors (human CD46, CD150, and Nectin 4) to infect different cell types (22) . Type-I interferon receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) knockout, human CD46 transgenic mice (IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46) mice can be robustly infected by MeV and have been used as a model to test the efficacy of many rMeV-based vaccine candidates (38) . Thus, rMeV-preS and rMeV-S1 were tested in IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice to determine if they are immunogenic (Fig. 3A) . Six-week-old IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice were immunized with 8 × 10 5 PFU of each vaccine candidate (half subcutaneous and half intranasal) and at week 2 were boosted with the same vaccine candidate at a dose of 6 × 10 5 PFU. Sera were collected at week 3 and antibody to preS was quantified by ELISA. We observed that rMeV-S1 induced higher antibody in IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice than in cotton rats. However, rMeV-preS induced more antibody than rMeV-S1, but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05) (Fig. 3B) . These results suggest that rMeV-S1 may replicate more robustly in the presence of hCD46 receptor than it did in the cotton rat, where it induced a lower level of antibody.\n",
            " At week 3, all groups were euthanized and their splenocytes were used to characterize vaccine-induced T cell immunity. We first quantified SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-producing T cells by enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot). Mice immunized with rMeV-preS had significantly higher frequencies of S1 peptide-specific IFN-γ-producing T cells compared to the control mice vaccinated with rMeV vector (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3C ). Upon stimulation with peptide pools spanning the S1 subunit, five out of six mice in the rMeV-preS group showed a strong antigen-specific IFN-γ-producing T cell response, whereas only two out of six mice in the rMeV-S1 group showed a weak T cell response (Fig. 3C ). When S2 peptide pools were used for stimulation, only two of six mice in the rMeV-preS group had a strong IFN-γ-producing T cell response (Fig. 3C) , indicating that the vaccine candidate induced T cells primarily targeting the N terminus of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To further characterize the nature of vaccine-induced T cells, four mice with the strongest IFN-γ-producing T cell responses in the rMeV-preS group were analyzed using flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 3 D and E) . Th1 cells, which produce cytokines such as IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin (IL)-2, play an important role in protection against viral infection (39) . After peptide stimulation ex vivo, CD8 + T cells producing one or more of the three signature Th1 cytokines, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, were detected in all four mice immunized with rMeV-preS (Fig. 3 D and E) . Moreover, antigen-specific cytokine-producing CD4 + T cells were also detected but at lower frequencies representing 0.1 to 0.5% of the total CD4 + T cells (Fig. 3D ). Together, these data suggest that rMeV-preS vaccine candidate is capable of inducing robust T cell immunity that is predominated by CD8 + T cells capable of producing Th1 cytokines.\n",
            " A Single Immunization of rMeV-preS Induces a High Level of Antibody in IFNAR1 −/− Mice. Recently, it was shown that type-I interferon, but not the hCD46, is the barrier for MeV infection in mice (38) . IFNAR1 −/− mice can be readily infected by MeV (38) . Thus, we compared the effectiveness of single immunization and booster immunization in inducing S-specific antibody in IFNAR1 −/− mice. For the single immunization group, IFNAR1 −/− mice were immunized with 8 × 10 5 PFU of rMeV-preS (half subcutaneous and half intranasal). For the booster immunization group, IFNAR1 −/− mice were immunized with 8 × 10 5 PFU of rMeV-preS and were boosted at the same dose 4 wk later (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A ). At week 7, S-specific antibody in the booster immunization group was significantly higher than the single immunization group (P < 0.01) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B ). At week 8, there was no significant difference between these two groups (P > 0.05) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B ). This result suggests that a single (C) Measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody. Antibody titer was determined by a plaque reduction neutralization assay. Dotted line indicates the detectable level at the lowest dilution. Data are expressed as the geometric mean titers (GMT) of five cotton rats ± SD.

            " immunization of rMeV-preS may be sufficient to induce a high level of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody.\n",
            " rMeV-preS Is Highly Immunogenic in Golden Syrian Hamsters. Golden Syrian hamsters are an excellent animal model to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the efficacy of vaccine candidates or antiviral drugs. Early studies also suggest that golden Syrian hamsters are susceptible to MeV infection (40, 41) . However, the optimal route for MeV immunization in hamsters is unknown. Thus, we chose the combination of intranasal and subcutaneous route for immunization in order to achieve maximal levels of immune responses. We chose rMeV-S1 to compare with rMeV-preS in the hamster study as rMeV-S1 induced good antibody responses in IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice (Fig. 3B) and grew to the highest titer in Vero cells (Fig. 1C ). Ten 4-wk-old golden Syrian hamsters in each group were first immunized with 8 × 10 5 PFU of the parental rMeV, rMeV-preS, or rMeV-S1 and boosted with the same dose 3 wk later (Fig. 4A) . High antibody titers were detected in all 10 hamsters in the rMeV-preS group at week 2 after a single-dose vaccination. After a booster immunization at week 3, antibody titers further increased at weeks 4 and 6 (Fig. 4B) . However, only 1 out of 10 hamsters in the rMeV-S1 group produced a robust antibody response (Fig. 4B) . As expected, neutralizing antibodies in the rMeV-preS group were detectable at week 2 and increased at weeks 4 and 6, whereas neutralizing antibodies in the rMeV-S1 group remained at minimally detectable levels (Fig. 4C) .\n",
            " We compared the level of neutralizing antibody induced by rMeV-preS in hamsters with that induced in acute and convalescent IFNAR −/− -hCD46 mice (n = 5 or 6) were inoculated with 8 × 10 5 PFU of rMeV, rMeV-preS, or rMeV-S1. Two weeks later, mice were boosted with 6 × 10 5 PFU of each virus. Half the dose was delivered subcutaneously and the other half was delivered intranasally. Serum samples were collected at week 3 for antibody detection. Mice were killed at week 3 for the T cell assays. (B) Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibody by ELISA. Highly purified preS protein was used as the coating antigen for ELISA. Dotted line indicates the detectable level at the lowest dilution. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (****P < 0.0001; ns indicates no significant difference; P > 0.05). (C) ELISpot quantification of IFN-γ-producing T cells. Spot forming cells (SFC) were quantified after the cells were stimulated by peptides representing N (S1 peptides, red) and C (S2 peptides, green) termini of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Data are means of five mice ± SD. *P < 0.05 as determined by unpaired t test. (D) Cytokine expression in CD8 + and CD4 + splenocytes. Splenocytes of four rMeV-preS-vaccinated mice with highest SFC were stimulated ex vivo for 5 h with pools of S1 peptides representing the N-terminal of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (5 μg/mL each) in an intracellular cytokine staining assay. Frequencies of CD4 + T cells expressing cytokines represent CD4 + T cells expressing IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-2. *P < 0.05 as determined by Student's t test. (E) Flow plots of cytokine production.

CD8 + T cells expressing CD107a and IFN-γ are shown as red dots and cells also expressing TNF-α are shown as green dots. sera collected from six COVID-19 patients at two time points: once diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed (V1) and 30 d later (V2). As expected, antibody titer of convalescent sera from the recovered COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than the titer of sera collected from the same patients during acute infection (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4C) . Importantly, neutralizing antibody titers at weeks 4 and 6 in rMeV-preS-immunized hamsters were significantly higher than these random human convalescent sera (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) (Fig. 4C) . These results confirm that rMeV-preS is highly immunogenic.\n",
            " Replication in Golden Syrian Hamsters. At week 7, hamsters in the rMeV, rMeV-S1, and rMeV-preS groups were moved to a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) animal facility and challenged intranasally with 10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. The normal control hamsters continued to be housed in the BSL2 animal facility and were inoculated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). At day 4 postchallenge, five animals from each group were killed, and the remaining five animals were killed at day 12 postchallenge. We systemically evaluated the protection efficacy of rMeV-based vaccine candidates including clinical signs, weight loss, viral replication, RNA replication, cytokine responses in the lung, and lung histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Hamsters in the rMeV vector control group that were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited clinical symptoms such as ruffled coat and weight loss (Fig. 5A) . Hamsters in the rMeV group started to lose weight at day 1 postchallenge and reached ∼15% weight loss at day 6 and then started to regain weight from days 8 to 12 (Fig. 5A) . Hamsters in the rMeV-S1 groups had similar weight loss from days 1 to 6 but had a faster weight recovery compared to the rMeV group (Fig. 5A) . Importantly, hamsters in the rMeV-preS group did not have any abnormal reaction or weight loss. The body weight in the rMeV-preS group was not significantly different at most time points compared to the normal controls (Fig. 5A) .\n",
            " At day 4, five animals from each group were killed, and lungs, nasal turbinate, brain, liver, and spleen were collected for virus titration by plaque assay. An average titer of 7.4 × 10 5 and 1.7 × 10 5 PFU/g of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in lungs (Fig. 5B ) and nasal turbinates (Fig. 5C ) in the rMeV group, respectively. No infectious virus was detected in brain, liver, or spleen tissues in the rMeV group. Similarly, 4.4 × 10 5 and 1.7 × 10 5 PFU/g of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in lungs (Fig. 5B) and nasal turbinates (Fig. 5C ) in the rMeV-S1 group, respectively, which were not significantly different from the rMeV group (P > 0.05). Importantly, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was below the detection limit in the lung in the rMeV-preS group (Fig. 5B ) and only three out five animals had low viral titer (1.9 × 10 3 PFU/g) in nasal tissue (Fig. 5C ). At day 12, the remaining five hamsters in each group were killed. No infectious SARS-CoV-2 was detected in lung ( Fig. 5B ), nasal turbinate (Fig. 5C) , or other tissues of any group.\n",
            " To determine if SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA was present in these tissues we used primers annealing to the 5′ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The highest number of background RNA copies detected in an unchallenged control group was set as the detection limit. As expected, high genome RNA copies were detected in both the lung (Fig. 5D ) and nasal turbinate (Fig. 5E ), moderate levels of viral RNA were detected in brain (Fig. 5F) , and near-detectable levels of viral genome RNA were detected in liver (Fig. 5G) and spleen (Fig. 5H ) tissues in the rMeV group at day 4. It should be noted that genomic RNA copies in lung, nasal turbinate, and brain in the rMeV-preS group were significantly lower than in the rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups (P < 0.001, P < 0.0001). Importantly, the average RNA copies in lungs, brain, liver, and spleen from the rMeV-preS group were near or below the detection limit whereas nasal turbinate had RNA titers of ∼10 4 RNA copies/g tissue. At day 12, low levels of RNA were detected in nasal tissue and little or no RNA was detectable in all other tissues in all groups.\n",
            " In addition to the full-length genome RNA, SARS-CoV-2 replication generates subgenomic RNA, which is more abundant than genomic RNA. Thus, we determined the levels of total viral RNA including genomic and subgenomic RNA using primers annealing to the N gene located at the 3′ end of the genome. Overall, the patterns of total RNA titers in lung (Fig. 5I) , nasal turbinate (Fig. 5J ), brain (Fig. 5K) , liver (Fig. 5L) , and spleen (Fig. 5M) were similar to those of genomic RNA in these tissue Collectively, these results demonstrate that rMeV-preS vaccination provided complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters whereas rMeV-S1 was unable to protect hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",
            " Storm in Lungs. Cytokine storms play an important role in the pathogenesis and disease severity of COVID-19 patients (42) . Thus, we determined whether rMeV-preS vaccination can prevent cytokine storm in the lungs. Briefly, IFN-α1, IFN-γ, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, TNF, and CXCL10 in lungs in each group were quantified by real-time RT-PCR and normalized to a control. Lung IFN-γ (Fig. 6B) , IL-6 ( Fig. 6E) , and CXCL10 (Fig. 6G ) mRNA had ∼17to 36-, 66-to 84-, and 27-to 48-fold increases in rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups compared to the normal control group, respectively. However, the increases in these three cytokine mRNAs in the rMeV-preS group were minimal (two-to fourfold increase). Statistically, IFN-γ, IL-6, and CXCL10 were indistinguishable between the rMeV-preS group and the normal control group (P > 0.05). In addition, increases in TNF (Fig. 6F ) and IL-1b (Fig. 6C) in the rMeV-preS group were significantly less than in rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups (P < 0.05). IFN-α1 (Fig. 6A ) and IL-2 (Fig. 6D) in rMeV, rMeV-S, and rMeV-preS groups were similar (P > 0.05). These results suggest that rMeV-preS immunization prevents the cytokine storm in hamster lungs caused by a SARS-CoV-2 challenge.\n",
            " Lung Pathology. All lungs from the hamster challenge study were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and the severity of histological changes was scored blindly by a trained veterinary pathologist (Fig. 7) . At day 4 postchallenge, all lung tissues from the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated rMeV group had extremely severe lung histopathological changes (average score of 4.0) characterized by extensive inflammation, interstitial pneumonia, edema, alveolitis, bronchiolitis, alveolar destruction, mononuclear cell infiltration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and peribronchiolar inflammation (Figs. 7 and 8 ). Lung pathology in the rMeV-S1 group was also very severe (average score of 3.8) but slightly less than in the rMeV group (P > 0.05) (Figs. 7 and 8 ). In contrast, lung tissues from the rMeV-preS group had little to mild pathological changes (average score of 0.8) (Figs. 7 and 8) . No lung pathology was found in the normal control group (score of 0) (Figs. 7 and 8) . At day 12, lung pathology in the rMeV group was still extremely severe (average score of 3.8) (Fig. 7 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ). Severe lung pathology (average score of 3.4) was found in the rMeV-S1 group. However, mild lung pathology (score of 0.9) was detected in the rMeV-preS group (Fig. 7 and SI Appendix, Fig.  S5 ). Lung sections were also stained with SARS-CoV-2 N antibody by IHC. At day 4, large amounts of SARS-CoV-2 N antigen were detected in all lung sections from the rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups (Fig. 9 ). In contrast, no N antigen was detected in lungs of the rMeV-preS group or the normal control ( Fig. 9 ). At day 12, little N antigen was detected in the rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups and no antigen was detected in the lungs of the rMeV-preS group or normal control (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 ). These results demonstrate that rMeV-preS vaccination protects hamsters from lung pathology and prevents SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression in lungs.\n",
            " In this study we developed a highly efficacious rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We found that the rMeV-preS-based vaccine candidate is more potent in triggering SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody than the rMeV-based full-length S vaccine candidate. Antibodies induced by rMeV-preS were uniformly high in all four animal models including cotton rats, IFNAR −/− mice, IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice, and Syrian golden hamsters and were significantly higher than antibody titers of human sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients. A single immunization of rMeV-preS was sufficient to induce a high level of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody. In addition, rMeV-preS induces high levels of Th1-biased T cell immunity. Syrian golden hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge including body weight loss, viral replication, cytokine storm, and lung pathology.\n",
            " The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine is one of the most successful vaccines in human history (21, 22) . Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, one dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective against MeV, 78% effective against mumps virus (MuV), and 97% effective against rubella. Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective against MeV and 88% effective against MuV. Both MeV and MuV are nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus and have potential as vectors to deliver foreign antigens. Particularly, MeV has been widely used as a vaccine vector. To date, more than 100 antigens have been expressed by MeV and more than 20 rMeV-based vaccines have been tested in preclinical trials (23, 43) . Animal studies have shown that rMeV-based vaccines are highly effective against infectious diseases. Common immunization routes such as intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intranasal were effective to induce a high level of immune responses in cotton rats, IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice, and nonhuman primates (34, 44, 45) . Currently, phase I clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate MeV-vectored vaccines against Zika virus (NCT02996890 and NCT04033068), Lassa virus (NCT04055454), and HIV (NCT01320176). In addition, a phase II clinical trials have demonstrated that a rMeV-vectored CHIKV vaccine was highly effective against CHIKV infection in humans (33) .\n",
            " Our data demonstrate that MeV is an excellent vaccine platform for delivering a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Live attenuated MeV vaccine has been widely used and has an excellent track 7 . Lung pathology score after challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Fixed lung tissues from days 4 and 12 after SARS-CoV-2 challenge were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm, deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin for the examination of histological changes by light microscopy. Each slide was quantified based on the severity of histologic changes including inflammation, interstitial pneumonia, edema, alveolitis, bronchiolitis, alveolar destruction, mononuclear cell infiltration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and peribronchiolar inflammation. Score 4 = extremely severe lung pathological changes; score 3 = severe lung pathological changes; score 2 = moderate lung pathological changes; score 1 = mild lung pathological changes; score 0 = no pathological changes. Data were analyzed using twoway ANOVA (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001). record of high safety and efficacy in the human population since the 1960s (33, 46, 47) . MeV grows to high titers in Vero cells, a WHO-approved cell line for vaccine production, facilitating vaccine manufacturing. Natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may not be long-lived (48, 49) . However, MeV vaccine induces longlasting immunity and protection against MeV infections (22, 50) . By expressing the S protein from an rMeV vector, it may be possible to also induce long-lasting immunity to the S protein and to protect against COVID-19 disease. In areas of the world where MeV vaccination is not complete, such a combination vaccine could protect against both diseases. By incorporating rMeV-preS into the existing MMR vaccine, a quadruple vaccine could be developed against these four important pathogens for children. According to American Academy of Pediatrics, the number of US infants, children, and teens diagnosed with COVID-19 had reached more 2.6 million by 21 January 2021, accounting for 12.7% of all cases in the United States. Such a quadruple vaccine would be highly attractive for children.\n",
            " In this study, we directly compared the efficacy of preS, native full-length S, S1, and three different lengths of RBD antigens in cotton rats. We found that the preS protein is the most potent antigen in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA antibodies, but more importantly, neutralizing antibodies. All five cotton rats immunized with rMeV-preS triggered uniformly high antibody responses whereas antibody titers in the rMeV-S group were variable. Although there was no significant difference in antibody titers (P > 0.05), the rMeV-preS induced significantly higher neutralizing antibodies than rMeV-S (P < 0.05). Similarly, rMeV-preS induced uniformly high antibodies in other animal models including IFNAR −/− -CD46 mice and golden Syrian hamsters. In hamsters, the neutralizing antibody induced by rMeV-preS was significantly higher than human COVID-19 convalescent sera (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that preS is more immunogenic than native full-length S. It is likely that spontaneous triggering of the metastable native full-length S leads to release of the S1 portion of the protein and refolding to the postfusion form, thereby losing the prefusion-specific antigenic sites and reducing its ability to induce neutralizing antibodies. This is similar to many fusion glycoproteins (such as those from paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, and HIV) in that the \"prefusion\" form of proteins are more potent in inducing neutralizing activity than its \"postfusion\" forms (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . We also found that S1 and the RBDs are poor antigens in the MeV vector, which is probably due to the suboptimal conformation of these monomeric proteins. Interestingly, Pfizer's BNT162b1, a lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the trimerized RBD, was effective in triggering neutralizing antibody in human clinical trials (7, 51) . Perhaps, the trimerization and/or adjuvants enhance its immunogenicity.\n",
            " One important advantage of using rMeV-preS-based vaccine candidate is that rMeV-preS induced predominately a Th1biased T cell response, thereby reducing the risk of potential antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). We observed high frequencies of CD8 + T cells capable of producing Th1 cytokines, whereas frequencies of CD4 + T cells were low. Similar results were observed in an earlier study in which mice were vaccinated with recombinant adenovirus vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein (52) . Consistent with this, hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge without any enhanced lung immunopathology. These results suggest that rMeV-preS is safe and highly efficacious. Historically, ADE has been a challenge in coronavirus vaccine development (53) . It was reported that inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine candidates (54) and several SARS-CoV-1 vaccine candidates, including an inactivated whole-virus vaccine (55), virus-like-particle vaccine (56) , and modified vaccinia virus Ankara-based recombinant vaccine (57), induced ADE in various animal models. Mechanistically, the excessive Th2-cytokine-biased responses and inadequate Th1-biased T cell response contributed to the immunopathology upon SARS-CoV-1 infection (53, 55, 56) . Thus, an ideal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should induce a high level of Th1 but not Th2-biased T cell response. Clearly, the rMeV-preS-based vaccine platform meets this criterion.\n",
            " During preparation of this manuscript, Hörner et al. reported an rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (58) . They inserted the full-length S gene between the H and L genes, the last two genes of the MeV genome and therefore the S protein would be expressed at a lower level. A single immunization of this recombinant virus [MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H)] did not induce any SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody. After booster immunization, only three out of seven animals produced detectable neutralizing antibody. After challenge with SARS-CoV-2, the MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H)-immunized hamsters had significant weight loss at postinfection days (PIDs) 1 to 3 but started to gain weight at PID 4. Furthermore, 4 to 5 log PFU/g tissue of SARS-CoV-2 were still detected in the nasal turbinate in MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H)-immunized hamsters. Thus, MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H) only induced partial protection Fig. 9 . rMeV-preS immunization prevents SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression in lungs. IHC staining of lung sections from hamsters killed at day 4 after SARS-CoV-2 challenge is shown. Lung sections were stained with SARS-CoV-2 N antibody. Micrographs with 1×, 2×, 4×, and 10× magnification of a representative lung section from each group are shown. Scale bars are indicated at the left corner of each image. against SARS-CoV-2 challenge (58) . It should be noted that our study differs significantly from the Hörner's study. We significantly improved the efficacy of the rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by using two different strategies. First, we generated rMeV expressing a stabilized, preS (rMeV-preS) and rMeV expressing full-length S protein (rMeV-S) and found that rMeV-preS was significantly more potent in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies than rMeV-preS. Second, our preS and S genes were inserted at the P and M gene junction, near the 3' end of the MeV genome. As a typical nonsegmented negativesense RNA virus, MeV mRNA transcription is sequential and gradient such that 3′ proximal genes are transcribed more abundantly than 5′ distal genes, thereby producing more copies of their encoded proteins. Thus, the expression of preS and S in our vaccines is much higher than Hörner's vaccine, which further enhance the immunogenicity. As shown in our report, rMeV-preS induced uniformly high levels of neutralizing antibody in all animals in all four animal models. A single immunization of rMeV-preS is sufficient to induce a high level antibody response. Importantly, rMeV-preS induced higher levels of neutralizing antibody than found in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, rMeV-preS provides complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.\n",
            " In summary, we have developed a safe and highly efficacious rMeV-based preS vaccine candidate that can provide complete protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and lung pathology in animal models, supporting its further development as a vaccine.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Many efforts have been made to generate spike glycoprotein-based vaccines to induce immunoprotection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both the mRNA-based (Jackson, Anderson et al., 2020 , Mulligan, Lyke et al., 2020 and protein-based (Guebre-Xabier, Patel et al., 2020) vaccines are effective in humans. Further protein-based designs at a preclinical stage of development promise superior safety and efficacy, at least in animal models (Watterson, Wijesundara et al., 2021) . However, there has been and continues to be a growing concern that existing and emerging virus mutants may escape currently-available vaccine-induced immunity (Mostaghimi, Valdez et al., 2021) . Although vaccinated individuals infected with the delta or omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 have a lower infectious viral titer (IVT) than non-vaccinated individuals (Puhach, Adea et al., 2022) , the spread of these variants is very rapid, despite high rates of vaccination using mRNA or vector vaccines encoding the spike protein alone. Therefore, proposals have been made to include other SARS-CoV-2 proteins known to generate high antibody titers and T-cell responses (Ahlen, Frelin et al., 2020 , Dutta, Mazumdar et al., 2020 .\n",
            " One of the four structural proteins ubiquitously required for viral replication is the nucleocapsid, which is immediately translated and expressed at excess quantities so that it is even secreted from infected cells into the blood. As a result, nucleocapsid detection is an effective means to screen infected individuals even before the onset of symptoms (Diao, Wen et al., 2020 , particularly because antibody production against this protein is rapid and abundant (Burbelo, Riedo et al., 2020 , Guo, Ren et al., 2020 . The 100-300 aa region of the nucleocapsid induces the highest antibody titer in humans (Smits, Hernández-Carralero et al., 2021) , which is attributed to its octapeptide structure homologous to the four hyperendemic seasonal coronaviruses (Pajenda, Kapps et al., 2021) . Epitope profiling of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with cross-reactivity to seasonal coronaviruses (Ladner, Henson et al., 2021) together with experimental data showing that an antibody against the nucleocapsid can protect mice from lethal infection with a hepatitis virus (Nakanaga, Yamanouchi et al., 1986) highlight the conceptual and technical potential of targeting this protein epitope. In addition, recent work in hamsters showed that immunization with attenuated intracellular replicating bacterium-vectored vaccines protects from the typical disease pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Jia, Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al., 2021) .\n",
            " Alternatively, specific antibodies raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize and inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-expressing cells . As such, the RBD is an immunodominant and specific target of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production in virus-infected individuals (Premkumar, Segovia-Chumbez et al., 2020) .\n",
            " Here, we generated a fusion protein that combines the nucleocapsid (N100-300 aa) and the RBD of the spike protein (S300-685 aa) in one molecule. The recombinant construct was introduced into bacterial and insect expression vectors and produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and insect cells, respectively.\n",
            " Its immunogenic efficacy was shown by murine vaccination studies using a prime-booster strategy, tested against all strains of SARS-CoV-2, provided prolonged immune responses and lacked any appreciable side-effect, particularly those occurring in the brain and related to mortality in humans exposed to other vaccines (Greinacher, Thiele et al., 2021 , Rzymski, Perek et al., 2021 , Zuhorn, Graf et al., 2021 .\n",
            " A total of 18 male and 4 female mice (C57BL/6J, 8-12-week-old) were group housed under standard conditions with a 12/12 light/dark cycle. The Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research granted approval for this research (2021-0.721.018). Experimental procedures were conformed to the 2010/63 European Communities Council Directive. Mice were habituated for at least a week to their environments and their numbers were kept at an absolute minimum. Blood was collected from the facial vein at a maximum volume of 200 µl every other week. At the end of the postimmunization survival period, mice were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane (at 5% with 1 L/min flow rate of tubed air) and then perfusion-fixed by transcardially applying 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.0). Dissected brains were immersed in the same fixative (without glutaraldehyde) at 4 °C overnight. Brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PB at 4 °C for 3 days. Coronal sections (50 μm) were cut on a cryostat microtome (1-in-4 series) and kept in 0.05% NaN3 in PB until immunohistochemical processing.\n",
            " The fusion protein was constructed using the Gibson assembly method (Gibson, Young et al., 2009) .\n",
            " For vector construction, the portion of the nucleocapsid (N100-300 aa) fused to the RBD (S300-685 aa) including 4 glycines as a hinge region was cloned into a pET-30a vector and designated 'VieVac' (Supplementary Figure 1A) . This product was generated by first producing 2 fragments by PCR using the N and S cDNAs obtained from the Krogan laboratory as template (Gordon, Jang et al., 2020) \n",
            " The pEntry/D-TOPO/VieVac construct (25 ng) was shifted into the baculovirus-compatible pDEST™ 10 expression vector. Using Clonase LR-Reaction II, both plasmids (pEntry/D-TOPO/VieVac and pDEST™ 10) were combined together with 1 µl 5x LR-Clonase II enzyme in a final volume of 5 µl. \n",
            " Seventy-two h after infection, Sf9 or Hi5 cells were centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min. Cells in the pellet were lysed using diluted BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent® (1:3 in PBS). After lysate sonication for 10 s and addition of benzonase endonueclease, the insoluble material was pelleted at 12,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was re-solubilized in 6M GuHCl, 0.1M NaH2PO4, 0.01M Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and passed through a Ni-NTA binding column (Qiagen). The loaded column was washed with 8M urea, 0.1M NaH2PO4, 0.01M Tris-Cl (pH 8,0) followed by 8M urea, 0.1M NaH2PO4, 0.01M Tris-Cl (pH 6.3) as also described for proteins produced in E. coli (see below). Finally, elution of the recombinant protein was carried out with 8M urea, 0.1M NaH2PO4, 0.01M Tris-Cl (pH 4.5) containing 250 mM imidazole.\n",
            " The resultant eluate was tested for protein content by spectrophotometry and immunoblotting.\n",
            " In order to test 'VieVac'-fusion protein expression in insect cells, Sf9 and Hi5-cells suspended in tissue culture medium were employed to generate cyto-slide preparations using a cyto-centrifuge. Air-dried cyto-preparations were fixed in acetone for 5 min. A water repellent circle was drawn around the area where cells were spread. Following wetting with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), 60 µl of prediluted HIS.H8 mAb (Sigma) was applied onto the cells and incubated for 2 h under continuous agitation at room temperature in a moisturized chamber. After washing in PBS for 10 min, Alexa Fluor 594tagged goat anti-mouse antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature under continued gentle agitation. Hoechst 33,342 was routinely used as nuclear counterstain. Following repeated washes, specimens were mounted by Vectashield and coverslipped. Images were captured on a confocal microscope (Zeiss 880).\n",
            " The engineered pET-30a/VieVac vector was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli using the heat shock method: Two µl of plasmid were mixed with 100 µl BL21 (DE3) or BL21 Codon Plus E. coli and incubated on ice for 30 min. Following a 45 s heat shock at 42 °C, the samples were returned to ice for 5 min. SOC Medium was applied and bacteria were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C under constant shaking. Aliquots were spread onto LB/kanamycin plates, which were incubated at 37 °C overnight.\n",
            " Kanamycin-resistant colonies were expanded in liquid culture using LB/kanamycin broth overnight.\n",
            " The culture volume was expanded 5x with Terrific Broth and induced with 200 µmol isopropyl-ß-Dthiogalactopyranosid (IPTG) to induce protein expression (at 22 °C over 24 h, shaking at 190/min).\n",
            " Protein extraction was performed in 8M urea, 0.1M NaH2PO4, 0.01M Tris Cl (pH 8) following pelleting of bacteria at 6,000 rpm in a FIBERLite® Rotor (ThermoScientific, F15-8x50cy). The resultant bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Pre-cleared supernatant was mixed with Ni-NTA His-Bind Resin (Novagen) (Pajenda et al., 2021 and incubated under constant rotation (roller mixer SRT6D, Stuart®) for 10 min. The bacterial lysate/resin was loaded onto a Poly-Prep Chromatography Column (Bio-Rad) and drained by unit gravity flow. The column was washed with 8x volumes of 8M urea, 0.1M NaH2PO4, 0.01M Tris Cl (pH 6.3) also containing 20 mM imidazole.\n",
            " Specifically-bound recombinant protein was eluted in 8 fractions of 300 µl each using elution buffer (8M urea, 0.1M NaH2PO4, 0.01M Tris Cl (pH 4.5), 250 mM imidazole).\n",
            " Aliquots of the purified protein or its N and S subregions (Pajenda et al., 2021 were loaded into individual wells of a 4-20% 10-well SDS-PAGE and run under reducing conditions. The gel was transferred by semidry blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The resultant filter was blocked in BM Chemiluminescence Blocking Reagent for 30 min and incubated in 1:100 convalescent serum or 1:1,000 mouse immune serum at room temperature for 2h. Following 2 washes with TPBS (10 min each), goat anti-human IgG (H+L) F(ab')2 HRP or goat anti-mouse immunoglobuline/HRP was applied and incubated at room temperature under constant shaking for 2 h. Following another 2 washes with TPBS (10 min each), antibody binding was detected by using BM chemiluminescence substrate solutions A and B. Images were recorded with the Fusion FX Vilber Lourmat (Vilber).\n",
            " Next, we tested whether the recombinant protein could adsorb onto Imject™ Alum adjuvant (Hogenesch, 2012) . The protein was mixed with the adjuvant in a 1:1 (V/V) ratio, then the potentially formulated vaccine was dialyzed with a Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassette (Thermo Scientific, MWCO 3500) against PBS at 4°C under constant stirring for 4 h. To demonstrate the adsorption of the immunogen to the adjuvant, the nanostructured vaccine was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 4 min. The precleared supernatant and pellet each were treated with Laemmli sample buffer and loaded separately onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and run under reducing conditions. The gel was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrans by semi-dry blotting. The filter was then incubated with convalescent sera diluted 1:100 and further developed as described above.\n",
            " The purified VieVac protein was mixed with Imject™ alum and mice (n = 4) were injected intraperitoneally with 20 µg of the prepared immunogen after 5 h of dialysis against PBS. In a second step, the adjuvant AddaVax™ combined with the VieVac protein was dialyzed similarly, then animals were injected with the adjuvant only for the control group (n = 5) and with the immunogenic AddaVax/VieVac protein at doses of 10µg, 20µg and 40µg (n = 13). In both experiments, a second immunization with the same antigen preparation was administered after 14 days (Figure 2A) . Serum was collected 14 and 28 days after the first immunization and tested by ELISA. Gene expression in blood cells and spleen was measured by qPCR at day 28.\n",
            " Ninety-six-well or 384 well (IgG titer analysis) flat-bottom non-tissue culture treated plates (Falcon) were coated with 100 µl/well of recombinant protein (both N and S) at a concentration of 1µg/ml. After 1 h of incubation at room-temperature on a plate shaker set to 300 rpm, the antigen-containing fluid was replaced by protein-containing blocking buffer (2x blocking reagent in PBS) for an incubation period of 30 min. Following a brief wash with PBS (200 µl), mouse serum diluted 10 -2 to 10 -5 in 100 µl assay buffer was incubated on a plate shaker for 60 min. The ELISA plate was then washed 3x with 350 µl TPBS using an ELISA washing machine (ELX50 Auto Strip Washer, Bio-Tek, Inc.). Antibody binding was determined with goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugate (1:10,000 in assay buffer supplemented with goat serum (2% V/V)) and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Finally, 100 µl of TMB substrate/chromogen mixture were applied and reacted in the dark for 10 min. Color development was terminated by adding 100 µl of 2M H2SO4 and read on an ELISA reader (Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader, Bio-Tek, Inc.) at 450 nm. Each sample was processed in technical duplicates. S and N titers were measured by end-titration using flat-bottomed 384-well Nunc™ plates. ELISA was performed under similar conditions as above, with the reaction volume reduced to 50 µl per well. The reciprocal of the serum dilution was chosen, which gave a 2-fold OD value over the control.\n",
            " Peripheral blood was subjected to hemolysis using the Erythrocyte Lysis Buffer EL (Qiagen) and RNA was isolated from white blood cells by the MagMAX mirVana Total RNA isolation kit. In brief, lysis buffer mixed with isopropanol was added to each cell pellet and incubated for 3 min. RNA-binding bead mix was added to adsorb RNA onto magnetic beads. Following aspiration of the supernatant, magnetic beads were washed sequentially. TURBO DNase solution was used to prevent genomic DNA contamination, followed by addition of rebinding buffer mixed with isopropanol. Magnetic beads were washed again and after removing the supernatant dried on a rotating platform. Finally, RNA was released by preheated elution buffer and evaluated for its concentration. Tissue fragments of 20-50 mg of mouse spleen were minced in Precellys Ceramic Kit 2.8 mm tubes using the precellys 24 lysis and homogenization device (Bertin Technologies) following the addition of 1000 µl of TRIzol™ Reagent.\n",
            " Subsequently, 200 µl of chloroform were applied and mixed by frequently inverting each tube.\n",
            " Following centrifugation at 12,000 g for at 4 °C for 10 min, the aqueous phase was mixed with 500 µl isopropanol. After incubation fat room temperature or 10 min, RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min. RNA pellets were dried after a wash with 75% ethanol and dissolved in nuclease free water for quantification by a Nano drop device.\n",
            " Six hundred ng of RNA were mixed with random primers heated at 65 °C and briefly chilled on ice.\n",
            " dNTPs, RevertAid RT and reaction buffer were added and subjected to first strand synthesis at 55°C for 60 min following primer annealing at 25 °C for 5 min. Enzyme activity was inactivated by heating at 80 °C for 10 min. A 20 µl first strand solution was diluted with 60 µl nuclease-free water and either processed immediately or stored at -80°C. For quantitative PCR, 2 µl of first strand DNA, 1 µl of 10x gene specific ProbeSet from TaqMan, 5 µl of TaqMan 2x universal PCR master mix and 2 µl H2O were mixed for each reaction, which all were carried out in duplicate. Reactions were performed on 384 well plates in a QuantStudio 6 Flex machine (Applied Biosystems). At each experiment, 40 cycles were recorded and quantitative data were presented in ΔΔCT mode and showing fold regulation relative to the control. Statistics were calculated using ΔCT values of individual samples.\n",
            " Viable mouse splenocytes were isolated by homogenizing spleen tissues through a 70 µm mesh followed by erythrocyte lysis using the RBC Lysis Buffer (Biolegend) \n",
            " Free-floating sections were rinsed in PB (0.1M, pH 7.4). Non-specific immunoreactivity was suppressed by incubating the sections in a mixture of 5% normal donkey serum (NDS; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PB at room temperature for 2 h. Sections were then exposed (4°C for 3 days) to select combinations of primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 2 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss) at either 10× or 63× primary magnification with the pinhole set to 0.5 -0.7 μm. Emission spectra for each dye were limited as follows: Cy2 (505-530 nm), Cy3\n",
            " (560-610 nm) and Cy5 (650-720 nm). Cell counting was performed in ImageJ. Three sections of the hippocampus (CA1) were analyzed per animal (n = 3/experimental group). The stratum pyramidale was excluded from quantification because of its high neuron density.\n",
            " Adherence to a Gaussian distribution was determined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normallydistributed data were provided as means ± s.d. In case of skewed distribution, data were described as medians (25 th and 75 th percentiles). Qualitative variables were described with counts and percentages and compared using Fisher's exact test. A two-tailed p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed with SPSS ® Statistics (version 21). In histochemical experiments, data were normalized to a surface area of 1 mm 2 and expressed as means ± s.e.m, followed by one-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism.\n",
            " Earlier work in infected individuals showed abundant antibody production against parts of the nucleocapsid, while neutralizing antibodies were shown to recognize regions in the RBD (and also NTD) of the spike protein (Sterlin, Mathian et al., 2021 . These findings prompted us to design a fusion protein including immunodominant regions of bot the S and N proteins. (Fig. 1A) Fig. S1 shows the resultant divalent recombinant nucleotide and protein sequences, which we sought to test for their immunogenicity.\n",
            " First, we produced and purified the fusion protein (termed 'VieVac') in E. coli. The recombinant protein containing a 6-His-tag was successfully purified by 8M urea. As shown in Fig. 1B ,C, the recombinant protein migrated at ~70 kDa, which is at the calculated cumulative molecular weight of the N100-300 aa (lane 3 in Fig. 1B,) and S300-685(lane 2 in Fig. 1B) . In addition to the entire 'VieVac' protein, a truncated fragment co-purified in most experiments due to a premature translation stop (lane 2 in Fig.   1C ).\n",
            " To evaluate whether the 'VieVac' protein would adsorb to AOH and AlPO4-based adjuvant (Imject™ Alum), immunoblotting of formulated 'VieVac' was performed after pelleting of the nanoparticulate structures by centrifugation. This revealed that the protein was recovered in its entirety in the particlecontaining pellet (Fig S2, lane 3) .\n",
            " In a second attempt, 'VieVac' production was performed in eukaryotic cells. This was motivated by the fact that the RBD is structurally composed of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel -fold, with strands and loops connecting the -strands, and is kept in its configuration by 4 disulfid bonds between 8 cysteins. Since this delicate type of folding develops better in eukaryotic cells, the recombinant gene fusion was re-engineered into the baculovirus system with the non-truncated protein successfully produced in Hi5 cells as demonstrated by immunofluorescence labelling 72 h after infection (Fig. 1D) .\n",
            " This protein could be purified through its N-terminal His-tag in its full length. Only minor degredation products co-purifed on Ni-NTA colums (Fig. 1E) .\n",
            " To reduce the required amount of the antigen, the recombinant fusion protein was adsorbed onto an AlOH and AlPO4-based adjuvant. First, mice (n = 4) were challenged with this immunogen in a standard regimen ( Fig. 2A ) (Wagner, Gessl et al., 1996) . Immunogen-challenged mice developed IgG by 14 days (nucleocapsid titer 10 -2 -5x10 -2 and RBD 10 -2 -10 -3 ) after the first dose, which increased to a significant IgG response to both antigens 28 days after the initial injection (nucleocapsid end-titer 10 -5 and RBD end-titer 5x10 -4 -10 -5 ) ( Fig. 2B-F) . None of the mice showed any adverse side effect, e.g. weight loss or neurological complications (data not shown). Mouse #1 had a shallow IgG response towards the nucleocapsid after the first booster injection (end-titer 10 -2 ) (Fig. 2B) . When receiving a second booster, this mouse also responded to the nucleocapsid when tested later ( Fig. 2D) with an end-titer of 10 -5 (Fig.   2E ).\n",
            " In order to investigate the durability of the IgG immunogen response, mice were kept under normal conditions and tested after 90 days for the mutant RBD of SARS-CoV-2 variants termed gamma (K417T and E484K) and delta (L452R and T478K). This revealed immune cross-reactivity of alpha RBD with the delta variant and significantly (p = 0.0138, 19%) reduced cross-reactivity with the gamma variant ( Fig. 2D) . Mouse #1 having received two booster injections showed similar reactivity towards both the alpha and delta variants.\n",
            " In a second study, 'VieVac' generated in a eukaryotic expression system was formulated with AddaVax™, an MF59 compatible adjuvant, which is approved in Europe and has been used in influenza vaccines (Mbow, De Gregorio et al., 2010) and beyond (Chappell, Mordant et al., 2021) . Mice (n = 13) were again challenged with 3 different doses of recombinant divalent antigen mixed with AddaVax™ according to the benchmarked immunization strategy used above (see Fig. 2A ). Ten out of thirteen recipients produced IgG against both proteins (nucleocapsid titer: 10 -2 -10 -3 and RBD titer :10 -2 -10 -3 ) after 14 days. Control mice received AddaVax™ only (n = 5). Fourteen days after a booster injection, 9\n",
            " out of the 13 test mice showed a further increase in their IgG responses to both antigens (nucleocapsid titer: 10 -4 -5x10 -5 and RBD titer: 5x10 -3 -10 -5 ) (Fig. 2E-F and Fig. 3A1-A2 ).\n",
            " Next, we tested mouse sera (n = 6) for individual IgG cross-reactivity against the virus variants gamma and delta. As compared to alpha, each serum IgG content was tested 14 days after booster injection for its reactivity against the mutant RBD (Fig. 3B) . The immune response (per IgG) varied amongst the mice but was reduced on average by 63% (p < 0.023) towards the gamma variant and 43% (nonsignificant) towards the delta variant, as compared to the alpha variant when measured at a titer of 10 -2 .\n",
            " However, similar end-titers were found for alpha, gamma-delta, and omicron variants, ranging from 5x10 -3 to 10 -4 , with the exception of one mouse in which the end-titer was an order of magnitude lower when alpha was compared with gamma, delta and omicron (Fig. 2F) . These data show that our #VieVac's trategy is equally efficient against all prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strains.\n",
            " Next, we addressed the effector potential of the constructs injected by analyzing cytotoxic lymphocytes (NK-T-cells), which have been suggested as the most important determinants of cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity. In peripheral blood, the AddaVax™/VieVac immunized group (n = 13) showed a 4.6fold (p < 0.013) granzyme A and a 4-fold (p < 0.005) perforin mRNA increase, as compared to the AddaVax only control group (n = 4). (Fig. 3C,D) . In order to investigate changes in the lymphocyte populations in the spleen, 20-25 mg of spleen tissue was homogenized, and RNA extracted. When analyzed for changes in target gene expression, changes did not reach the level of significance, even though an up-regulation in granzyme A expression was seen (Table S1 ). Fig. 3E2 ). The extent of activated CD8 + T-cells after stimulation with N-specific peptides (n = 13) and\n",
            " S-specific peptides (n = 13) was significant relative to the control group (AddaVax™ only, n = 5; p = 0.0127 and p = 0.0167 respectively. (Fig. 3E4-E5) . Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was used as a positive control to illustrate the spectrum of CD44 response to a nonspecific T-cell stimulant (Fig.   3E3, E6) . S-specific stimulated CD8 + T-cells showed significantly higher stimulation by PHA in terms of CD44 upregulation compared to control (p = 0.0177) (Fig. 3E6) . This suggests that a higher state of alertness to non-specific stimuli is induced within the CD8 + T-cells after S-specific peptide exposure.\n",
            " Neurological side effects have been observed following vaccination with authorized viral vector-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (Chun, Park et al., 2022 , Greinacher et al., 2021 , Sharifian-Dorche, Bahmanyar et al., 2021 , Zuhorn et al., 2021 . Particularly, cerebrovascular venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a subtype of stroke in which blood clots form and obstruct blood flow in the brain's vascular system (Stam, 2005) . These conditions combined with a COVID vaccine-related thrombocytopenia have been termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) (Greinacher et al., 2021 , Schultz, Sørvoll et al., 2021 and this has become one of the most important research areas of our time.\n",
            " No differences were detected in endothelial morphology or blood vessel density/distribution, between experimental groups (Fig. 4A-D,) (Härtig, Reichenbach et al., 2009) . Reduced capillary staining, the presence of plaques, and ramified (activated) microglia were not detected either. Likewise, the distribution, density or morphology of microglia and astrocytes (Fig. S6A-D) also remained unchanged ( Fig. 4A-D) (Bignami, Eng et al., 1972 , Sasaki, Ohsawa et al., 2001 . No differences were observed in the cell number of neurons in selected brain areas either (Fig. 4E-F and S5) . These data support the notion that 'VieVac', at least in preclinical models, is unlikely to cause adverse neuropathological sideeffects.\n",
            " This study provides a proof-of-concept approach for the generation of divalent (or even polyvalent) protein backbones for the development of protein vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 taking advantage of the coincident presence of the most immunogenic viral regions hinged by flexible linkers to maintain ternary and quaternary structures. The construct design incorporates a rapidly mutating region (RBD) and a constitutive region (nucleocapsid), thus overcoming strain-specific hindrances in immunogenicity as increasingly seen for linearized mRNA vaccines.\n",
            " The RBD region is the backbone of all vaccination strategies presently available, even if its inferiority upon rapidly mutating SARS-CoV2 is already apparent. Since conformation-specific antibody responses may be important in immune defense against SARS-CoV2, recombinant proteins generated in eukaryotic systems are the tools of choice. This is significant because the RBD domain has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel ß-fold with strands and loops connecting its ß-strands. This fold could be resolved by crystallography of the RBD produced in Hi5 insect cells (Lan, Ge et al., 2020) . There are 9 cysteines in this region, 8 of which are involved in disulfide bond formation in order to generate the ACE-2 binding structure. Here, we show that insect bioreactor systems could also be amenable to producing vaccine backbones. Particularly, our molecular design incorporates 8 cysteines from the RBD region (300-685 aa), thus likely stabilizing the ternary structure of the protein to increase its recognition by the host's immune system, a feature likely contributing to a near-maximal immune response already at the second booster stage. In contrast, relatively limited emphasis has been directed towards the welltranscribed nucleocapsid protein in presently pursued SARS-CoV2 vaccine strategies in Europe and beyond, even if the nucleocapsid of other coronaviruses was earlier recognized for its immunogenicity (Boots, Kusters et al., 1991) . This lack of interest is surprising since 11% of human CD4+ T-cells and 12% of CD8+ T-cells recognize the nucleocapsid in individuals with SARS-CoV2 infection (Grifoni, Weiskopf et al., 2020) , supporting its immunogenic potential to generate potent immunoprotection by expanding surveillance to cellular branches of defense in humans.\n",
            " A homologue of an EDA-approved adjuvant was used to increase efficacy, which was in terms of T-cell response near-complete after a second booster, alike by others (Chappell et al., 2021) , and reached 100% upon a third inoculation in a staggered primer-booster regimen. The fact that high immunogenicity is detected even after 90 days in a mouse immunization model with near-equivalent efficacy against the alpha, delta and omicron strains when measuring the end-titer gives confidence in the correctness of this design strategy. Immunological analysis of lymphocytes harvested from the spleen of immunized animals showed a significant T-cell response as indicated by the significant upregulation of granzyme A and perforin, cytotoxic granule effector molecules, in peripheral lymphocytes. An increased expression of CD44 upon N-and S-specific peptide stimulation ex vivo demonstrated the generation of T-cells capable of executing cellular protection and production of interleucins (Tian, Patel et al., 2021) .\n",
            " Given the brevity of time for our compressed proof-of-concept workflow, we recognize that data on the generation of neutralizing antibodies, whose presence is assigned to immunity against the RBD ('spike') protein, is as yet lacking. However, and equally importantly, cellular immunity through T-cell responses is recognized as an essential means of protection. Accordingly, the adoptive transfer of T-cells into immunodeficient mice led to rapid recovery after the transfer of SARS-CoV-specific effector cells (Zhao, Zhao et al., 2009) . Similar results are seen in ferrets, in which neutralizing antibodies do not fully protect against SARS-CoV2-induced disease. Instead, nasal immunity, which is reliant on T-cell responses together with the presence of antibodies, seems to carry optimal protection (See, Petric et al., 2008) . Notably, nucleocapsid-related B-cell immunity has also been shown earlier , Pajenda et al., 2021 , Shrock, Fujimura et al., 2020 , and even served as a diagnostic tool because the detection of nucleocapsid-specific IgG in conjunction with RBDspecific IgG differentiated SARS-CoV2 exposure from a pure mRNA-based vaccine response.\n",
            " Therefore, the pronounced B-cell responses shown here support the hypothesis that both viral protein fragments of our divalent construct can provoke significant cellular immunity. Considering that the immunogenic peptides are native viral sequences (and neither forward nor reverse-engineered fragments that could curb immunogenicity), we view the B-and T-cell responses described here as minimally required yet sufficient experimental indices of our molecular design strategy to trigger significant protection against SARS-CoV2.\n",
            " In conclusion, we propose that the above molecular design together with biological data on the efficacy of the administered divalent recombinant protein outline a rational approach to generate an efficient protein vaccine pipeline (which we term as a prototypic \"VieVac\" vaccine), which can be built on both eukaryotic and prokaryotic bioreactors for scaleable production. The bivalent protein/adjuvant-based immunization is effective in eliciting humoral and cellular immunoresponses upon application in a prime-booster mode. Given that the repeated administration of \"VieVac\" evoked no side effects in the nervous system, we emphasize the safety of a protein-based vaccine. \n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " This manuscript has a data supplement Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) has also been reported after adenoviral 8 COVID-19 vaccines. 5 These reports led to vaccine hesitancy among patients with 9 thrombocytopenic disorders including immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP), a 10 relapsing, thrombotic microangiopathy caused by antibody mediated severe ADAMTS13 11 deficiency. These concerns were further compounded by reports of de novo and relapsed iTTP 12 following mRNA vaccines. 6-10 Whether SARS CoV-2 vaccination is associated with iTTP 13 recurrence has significant clinical implications; however, this has not been systematically 14 investigated. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to evaluate the safety of 15 SARS-CoV2 vaccination in patients with pre-existing iTTP. To estimate the incidence of iTTP 16 (de novo and relapsed) after vaccination, we examined cases of iTTP after COVID-19 17 vaccination reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the US passive 18 surveillance system for adverse events after immunization. 11\n",
            " Patients with confirmed iTTP (based on documented ADAMTS13 activity <10% during 20 an acute episode of thrombotic microangiopathy) and documented SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 21 followed at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Ohio State University, and University of Minnesota were 22 included. Details of iTTP and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and available laboratory data including 23 platelet counts and ADAMTS13 activity before and after vaccination were extracted from the 1 medical record. The primary outcome was iTTP relapse characterized by a platelet count <150 x 2 10 9 /L and microangiopathic hemolysis with ADAMTS13 activity < 10 % occurring within 4 3 weeks of vaccination, the typical window for post-vaccine autoimmune hematologic 4 complications. 12 We separately report iTTP relapses occurring at > 4 weeks after vaccination. 5 We also examined change in ADAMTS13 activity and platelet counts before and after 6 vaccination.\n",
            " Additionally, we searched the VAERS database for reports of adults (age > 18 years) 8 who developed iTTP after receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Individual reports were reviewed by 9 two independent investigators to determine whether these were consistent with iTTP. We 10 categorized cases as definite iTTP (documented severe ADAMTS13 deficiency), probable iTTP 11 (presentation and treatment compatible with iTTP but ADAMTS13 not reported), and possible 12 iTTP (presentation and treatment possibly compatible with iTTP but inadequate information to 13 make a definitive determination). Cases more compatible with alternative diagnoses such as ITP 14 or VITT were excluded. 100%). iTTP relapse within 4 weeks of vaccination occurred in one patient (1.3%), a 28-year-old 23 female at 1.5 years from her initial iTTP episode who did not recover ADAMTS13 activity at all 1 (<2%) during remission. Six days after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she developed 2 bruising, petechiae, ataxia, and slurred speech. Laboratory testing revealed thrombocytopenia, 3 schistocytes, and undetectable ADAMTS13 activity. She was successfully treated with 4 caplacizumab, rituximab, and corticosteroids without plasma exchange based on our prior 5 experience treating early relapse with this regimen. 13 She received the second dose of the Pfizer 6 vaccine uneventfully after ADAMTS 13 activity was > 20%. Another three patients were treated 7 for iTTP recurrences between 35 to 143 days after vaccination, which are less likely to be 8 associated with vaccination (Table S1 ). The incidence of iTTP relapse over the entire 9 observation period after vaccination was 0.095 per patient-year. 10 We next examined the VAERS database for de novo and relapsed iTTP after COVID-19 Johnson vaccine (0.244 per million). While the temporal relationship of several cases occurring 23 within a month of vaccination is concerning for an association, the estimated incidence is not 1 higher than the incidence of iTTP in the United States (1.7 to 3.7 per million). 15, 16 2 De novo and relapsed iTTP have been reported after various vaccines 17-19 , including 3 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 6-10 , where the association is supported by absence of another proximate 4 cause and a temporal relationship with most cases occurring between 5 -15 days after 5 vaccination. Most cases of iTTP following COVID-19 vaccination in VAERS occurred within 6 14 days after vaccination, which is concerning for a possible association. In our cohort, three of 7 four patients with iTTP recurrence presented >30 days after vaccination arguing against vaccine-8 induced autoimmunity in these cases, though it must be noted that VITT has been reported up to 9 48 days after vaccination 5 so an association with iTTP relapse after 30 days is plausible and may 10 apply to the patient who had a relapse 35 days after the second vaccine dose (table S1).\n",
            " Vaccination could precipitate acute iTTP in patients who already have low ADAMTS13. This is 12 supported by the observation that ADAMTS13 deficiency is necessary but not sufficient for TTP 13 and that the only relapses in our cohort occurred in individuals with low/unknown ADAMTS13 14 activity within 3 months prior. Our combined cohort is relatively mature, and we offer 15 preemptive rituximab to patients with ADAMTS13 activity <20% during clinical remission, 16 which may explain the high pre-vaccination ADAMTS13 activity and corresponding low relapse 17 rate. Patients in clinical remission without ADAMTS13 remission 20 might be at increased risk 18 for relapse 21,22 following COVID-19 vaccination. We check ADAMTS13 activity every 3 19 months in all patients to estimate risk of recurrence (including post-vaccination). We recommend 20 checking a platelet count and ADAMTS13 activity weekly for 2-4 weeks after vaccination in 21 those with lowADAMTS13 activity (<20-30%). 22 1 medical record. However, we are unable to report other vaccine-associated adverse events since 2 these were not consistently documented. A limitation of VAERS data is that some cases have 3 limited clinical and laboratory information (including ADAMTS13). 23 To address this challenge, 4 we categorized cases based on certainty of the TTP diagnosis. Finally, VAERS is a passive 5 surveillance system and iTTP after vaccination may be underreported, 23 which is a limitation. To 6 avoid underestimating incidence, we included all reported cases of iTTP (rather than only 7 ADAMTS13 cases) and used only fully vaccinated individuals as the denominator.\n",
            " In summary, data from a large multicenter cohort and VAERS appear to be reassuring 9 that COVID-19 vaccination does not increase risk of de novo or relapsed iTTP except in 10 individuals with extremely low ADAMTS13 activity (<20%) in remission. Prospective studies to 11 confirm this finding are needed. Until then, these data may help individuals with iTTP and their 12 physicians make informed decisions about vaccination. \n"

By regressing SNP-level associations for two traits, (i.e., the product of Z scores, Z COVID19_A2 × Z UKBB_BMI ) and weighting each SNP by its LD Score (an estimate of the amount of total genetic variation tagged by each variant), one can estimate the magnitude and direction of shared genomic architecture between these traits. To control the multiple testing burden, we restricted analyses to the tested UKBB traits showing heritability ≥ 1% and for which prior studies have suggested correlations between COVID-19 and risk for severe outcomes, or traits that were correlated with traits that have been associated with severe outcomes.

Since smoking behaviors are heritable traits that correlate with many other complex diseases, we performed sensitivity analyses by excluding chromosomal regions (± 500 kb) around 473 SNPs previously associated with various smoking behaviors (⟂Smoke) to attenuate the genetic contribution of smoking-related variants 4 .

Sensitivity analysis excluding chromosomal regions known to be associated with smoking reduced the genomic inflation factor to 1.041 and h 2 to 0.34%. Sensitivity analysis excluding chromosomal regions known to be associated with BMI increased the genomic inflation factor to 1.050 and h 2 to 0.35% (Fig. 2 , Supplementary Table 6) .\n",
            " A prior GWAS analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 (phenotype B2: hospitalization; 9373 cases, 1,197,256 controls in only European-descent) identified loci on chromosomes 3, 12, 19, and 21 at genome-wide statistical significance, with a genomic inflation factor of 1.041, and an estimated h 2 of 0.19% (Fig. 2 ). Sensitivity analysis excluding chromosomal regions known to be associated with smoking reduced the genomic inflation factor to 1.038 and h 2 to 0.19%. Sensitivity analysis excluding chromosomal regions known to be associated with BMI reduced the genomic inflation factor to 1.035 and h 2 to 0.17% (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 6 ).\n",
            " Using these GWAS results, we next performed LDSR analyses with two phenotypes for COVID-19 severity (COVID-19 A2, and COVID-19 B2) considering four phenotypes for exclusions of genomic regions related to BMI and Smoking (COVID19_A2⟂BMI, COVID19_A2⟂Smoke, COVID19_B2⟂BMI, and COVID19_ B2⟂Smoke) and 64 UKBB polygenic traits that had SNP array-based heritability (h 2 ) ≥ 1% (to maximize study power and to provide reliable inferences). Twenty-three diverse traits showed moderate to strong co-heritability with COVID-19 disease severity ( Table 2, Supplementary Table 7) , including several at Bonferroni-corrected significance level (P < 1.30 × 10 −4 ). Very severe, respiratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness (A2) and COVID-19 hospitalization (B2) showed strong genomic correlation with traits related to adiposity, diabetes, digestive diseases, smoking behaviors, hematologic traits, and selected nutrient levels (Fig. 3 , Supplementary Table 7) .\n",
            " Among physical traits, the genetic architecture of COVID-19 disease severity was positively correlated with BMI (rg COVID19_A2 = 0.20, P COVID19_A2 = 1.51 × 10 −5 ; rg COVID19_B2 = 0.34, P COVID19_B2 = 1.99 × 10 −8 ), weight (rg COVID19_A2 = 0.17, P COVID19_A2 = 1.24 × 10 −4 ; rg COVID19_B2 = 0.27, P COVID19_B2 = 7.23 × 10 −7 ), and whole body fat mass (rg COVID19_A2 = 0.20, P COVID19_A2 = 7.81 × 10 −6 ; rg COVID19_B2 = 0.33, P COVID19_B2 = 2.24 × 10 −8 ). After excluding genomic regions previously associated with BMI, both BMI and whole body fat mass continued to show strongly significant positive correlation with COVID-19 disease severity (rg COVID19_A2⟂BMI = 0.17 and P COVID19_A2⟂BMI = 2.37 × 10 −3 ; rg COVID19_B2⟂BMI = 0.28 and P COVID19_B2⟂BMI = 1.82 × 10 −5 ).\n",
            " Among medical conditions, the genetic architecture of COVID-19 disease severity was positively correlated with shortness of breath walking on level ground (rg COVID19_A2 = 0.28, P COVID19_A2 = 2.87 × 10 −3 ; rg COVID19_B2 = 0.43, P COVID19_B2 = 4.56 × 10 −5 ), diabetes (rg COVID19_A2 = 0.54, P COVID19_A2 = 7.10 × 10 −4 ; , and diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (rg COVID19_A2 = 0.24, P COVID19_A2 = 4.84 × 10 −4 ; rg COVID19_B2 = 0.34, P COVID19_B2 = 3.54 × 10 −6 ). Excluding genomic regions associated with smoking behaviors or BMI generally attenuated these correlations, although most remained nominally associated at P < 0.05 and the association between COVID-19 hospitalization and diseases of the digestive system remained significant at Bonferroni-corrected levels after exclusion of smoking-associated loci (rg COVID19_B2⟂Smoke = 0.38, P COVID19_B2⟂Smoke = 2.30 × 10 −5 ).\n",
            " Among smoking behaviors, current tobacco smoking (rg COVID19_B2 = 0.34, P COVID19_B2 = 2.01 × 10 −6 ) and exposure to tobacco smoke at home (rg COVID19_B2 = 0.47, P COVID19_B2 = 1.73 × 10 −5 ) presented strongly significant positive genetic correlation with COVID-19 hospitalization, which were only modestly attenuated when removing known smoking-associated loci from analysis. Current tobacco smoking was more modestly associated with severe, respiratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness COVID (rg COVID19_A2 = 0.13, P COVID19_B2 = 0.021) and this association became non-significant after removing smoking-associated loci from analysis (Table 2) , supporting a link between known smoking risk loci and risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.\n",
            " Examining hematologic traits, both high light scatter reticulocyte percentage and count were significantly positively correlated with COVID-19 hospitalization, as was immature reticulocyte fraction. These traits were also positively correlated with severe COVID-19 illness, but not at Bonferroni-corrected levels of statistical significance. C reactive protein levels were also positively correlated with COVID-19 disease severity. Interestingly, serum (not urinary) albumin was negatively correlated with COVID-19 disease severity at nominal statistical www.nature.com/scientificreports/ significance (rg COVID19_A2 = − 0.12, P COVID19_A2 = 0.026; rg COVID19_B2 = − 0.16, P COVID19_B2 = 0.011), as were HDL, apolipoprotein A levels, and levels of serum IGF-1 ( Table 2) . We also examined the pairwise genetic relationship between COVID-19 disease severity and nutrient-related traits in UKB. Although we were not able to observe any significant associations between COVID-19 critical illness and hospitalization and nutrient-related traits at Bonferroni-corrected levels, we identified suggestive negative correlations with magnesium (rg COVID19_A2 = − 0.39, P COVID19_A2 = 2.28 × 10 −3 ; rg COVID19_B2 = − 0.36, P COVID19_B2 = 5.17 × 10 −3 ), retinol (rg COVID19_A2 = − 0.59, P COVID19_A2 = 0.041; rg COVID19_B2 = − 0.59, P COVID19_B2 = 0.029), and vitamin E (rg COVID19_A2 = − 0.53, P COVID19_A2 = 2.16 × 10 −3 ; rg COVID19_B2 = − 0.53, P COVID19_B2 = 3.10 × 10 −3 ) ( Table 2 and Supplementary Table 7 ). Vitamin D levels were not associated with risk for severe COVID-19 (rg COVID19_A2 = − 0.023, P COVID19_A2 = 0.67; rg COVID19_B2 = − 0.043, P COVID19_B2 = 0.44).\n",
            " We investigated the genetic correlations between COVID-19 disease severity (A2:critical illness and B2:hospitalization) with a variety of clinical and physiologic traits using summary-level GWAS data from extremely large patient cohorts, observing shared genomic architecture with a number of illnesses and biomarkers of somatic well-being. We identify a suite of medical conditions and physiological traits that appear to share the genetic architecture with that of COVID-19 severity. Many of these traits overlap those previously identified in the large databases of COVID-19 patient outcomes, including traits related to adiposity, kidney function, and pulmonary insufficiency. We also identified additional traits that have received comparatively little attention, such as blood and serum levels of several vitamins and nutrients. Although our datasets are quite large (COVID-19 severity GWAS n = 707,407 and 1,206,629 for critical illness (A2) and hospitalization (B2), respectively; UKBB GWAS n = 361,194), larger datasets would likely identify many of these same associations and could potentially bring some of the nominally associated associations to a corrected level of statistical significance.\n",
            " Using an orthogonal genomics-driven approach that complements previous COVID-19 clinical epidemiology research, we confirm a link between the development of severe COVID-19 illness and both elevated BMI and diabetes. We also clarify associations with current smoking status, observing that it was positively correlated with COVID-19 disease severity, and note new associations with diverticulosis and reticulocyte traits. Additionally, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ we observe a suggestive association between increased disease severity and reduced levels of IGF-1-a marker of nutritional status-and additional suggestive protective associations with magnesium, retinol, and vitamin E levels. COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness. We observed that higher forced vital capacity (FVC) was negatively (protectively) associated with COVID-19 disease severity and observed a strongly positive correlation between the genetic architecture of 'shortness of breath while walking on level ground' and development of severe COVID-19 illness. Chest pain and discomfort have previously been associated with COVID-19 hospitalization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that individuals with chronic lung diseases including emphysema, chronic bronchitis, COPD, and interstitial lung disease are at high risk for becoming critically ill from SARS-CoV-2 1 . Our study demonstrates a positive correlation between the genetic architecture of these risk factors and COVID-19 disease severity through LDSR analyses. In this study, a differential diagnosis of COPD was strongly positively correlated with COVID-19 hospitalization, regardless of the exclusion of genomic regions related to BMI and smoking behaviors. Since chronic inflammation is an important feature in developing both emphysema and bronchitis, these finding suggest a potential shared genetic contribution between COPD and COVID-19 hospitalization separate from the contributions of known BMI and Table 2 . Cross-trait genetic correlations of COVID-19 on inclusion/exclusion of genomic regions associated with BMI and smoking. P-values in bold indicates P ≤ 1.30 × 10 −4 . COVID19_A2, very severe respiratory confirmed covid versus population including whole genomic regions; A2⟂BMI, very severe respiratory confirmed covid versus population with exclusion of genomic regions related to BMI; A2⟂Smoke, very severe respiratory confirmed covid versus population with exclusion of genomic regions related to smoking behaviors; COVID19_B2, hospitalized covid versus population including whole genomic regions; B2⟂BMI, hospitalized covid versus population with exclusion of genomic regions related to BMI; B2⟂Smoke, hospitalized covid versus population with exclusion of genomic regions related to smoking behaviors. Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue 0. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ smoking-related variants. Variants located in immune-related genes and contributing to increased pulmonary inflammation could be evaluated in future work. Traits related to smoking behaviors were generally associated with increased COVID-19 disease severity in our analyses, including current smoking, exposure to tobacco smoke either at home or outside home, in utero tobacco smoke exposure, and cumulative pack-years. Conversely, never-smoker status showed negative genomic correlation with COVID-19 disease severity. Although UKBB does not delineate former smokers in ascribing smoking status, our analyses indicate that the genetic determinants of current smoking are associated with increased COVID-19 disease severity and do not support the clinical observations that current smoking may protect against severe COVID-19 illness.\n",
            " Given the lack of a COVID-19 vaccine during the first year of the pandemic and continued supply scarcity in numerous regions, many studies have sought to identify alternative strategies to minimize risk of developing severe COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection and also to treat severe COVID-19. In addition to evaluations of existing pharmacologic agents (e.g., ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and dexamethasone), vitamin and nutrient supplementation has been widely studied. Global mortality rate differences associated with latitude and clinical observations of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels among hospitalized COVID-19 patients has perhaps garnered greatest attention 22 , but we did not observe a significant association between genetic determinants of vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity. However, we observed nominally significant protective effects for less-studied nutrient-related traits, including magnesium, calcium, retinol, and vitamin E. A combined vitamin D/magnesium/vitamin B12 combination was associated with a reduction in the proportion of elderly COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen support and intensive care support in a small prospective cohort 23 , and lower plasma retinol levels have also been observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 24 . We did not observe a significant association between serum Vitamin D levels and risk for COVID-19 or severe outcomes. Vitamin E levels have not been widely examined in the context of COVID-19, but deficiency is frequently associated with intestinal malabsorption rather than dietary insufficiency and thus may reinforce the observed genetic correlation between COVID-19 disease severity and diverticular disease in our analyses. In our study, we do observe an association between higher levels. Further, we observe protective associations for both HDL and serum concentration of apolipoprotein A, a major component of the HDL complex involved in clearing fat. HDL is involved in vitamin E absorption and contains approximately 40% of circulating α-tocopherol, the main dietary source of vitamin E 25 .\n",
            " Integration and harmonization of extant large-scale GWAS datasets has become a popular approach to reveal novel epidemiologic associations. Still, access to individual-level GWAS datasets remains limited, because of data www.nature.com/scientificreports/ use restrictions. The LDSR method does not require individual-level genotype data or LD pruning and can quantify the shared genetic architecture of traits having undergone GWAS analysis. However, LDSR analysis assumes absence of population stratification in the underlying summary statistics used and necessitates incorporation of GWAS data from populations expected to have similar genomic architecture. This assumption restricted our analysis to use of GWAS data from British-ancestry individuals, limiting our ability to make conclusions about the shared genetic architectures among other racial/ethnic groups. Given that COVID-19 disease severity has been associated with racial/ethnic background, as well as socioeconomic status and somatic well-being, it is imperative that efforts be made to enrich future genetic epidemiology studies for participants of non-European descent to expand generalizability of results. Interpretation of our results is also limited by the strong correlation between many of the traits studied with BMI and smoking behaviors. Although we made efforts to limit the impact of BMI and smoking-associated genetic variation by excluding known loci from LDSR analysis, such sensitivity analyses cannot account for polygenic contributions not yet having reached genome-wide statistical significance in prior research.\n",
            " To estimate cross-trait genetic correlation, we restricted the range of UKBB traits with an arbitrary threshold of h 2 ≥ 1% to improve reliability. For instance, there were additional subtypes of diabetes derived from the various medical records in UKBB and their estimates of SNP-heritability showed h 2 Type 1 Diabetes = 0.3% and h 2 Type 2 Diabetes = 0.4%. Therefore, we did not include results from them. The type of diabetes reported in Table 1 , described as \"Diabetes diagnosed by doctor\" (UKBB Field Identifier:2443), is not specified for the type of diabetes, but given the age of participants and the general prevalence of T2D versus T1D, the association between diabetes and COVID-19 severity is ostensibly driven by the shared genetic architecture between COVID-19 severity and the genetic architecture of T2D. Furthermore, LDSR analysis relies on the common genetic variants with MAF > 1% and therefore it can fail to capture the SNP-heritability on the observed scale due to underlying low-frequency or rare variants 4 . If a polygenic trait in UKBB shows a significant genetic correlation with COVID-19 severity, this does not imply a causal association. Both the tested trait and COVID-19 severity risk may be jointly influenced by an unmodeled trait that is independently associated with each 19 . Although our study relies on associations with common genetic variants (generally, MAF > 1%), the inclusion of additional rare genetic variants might be valuable as it could increase the overall trait heritability being modeled. Inferences from LDSR rely on normality assumptions that may be violated when rare variants are studied, and we therefore restricted analysis to more common variants. Additionally, LDSR does not explicitly model confounding effects which can arise when studying multiple correlated traits. Therefore, the method identifies novel associations that can be further studied using Mendelian Randomization or direct analyses of the nominated trait phenotypes for further confirmation of causal relationships. LDSR is a useful approach for identifying potential novel associations that will warrant further epidemiological analysis to tease apart causal associations from associations that are influenced by confounding.\n",
            " Our findings support previously identified risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness, including elevated BMI, diabetes, and numerous pulmonary conditions (e.g., COPD, reduced FEV, shortness of breath during mild activity). We also observe protective associations between the genetic underpinnings of COVID-19 severity and that of non-smoking, serum albumin, apolipoprotein A, HDL cholesterol level, and several nutrients. Further studies using Mendelian randomization approaches may help to dissect causal associations between COVID-19 disease severity and these traits, potentially nominating targets for therapeutic intervention.\n",

            " As we pen down this sentence, cases of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) are continuously increasing across the globe. In accordance to 26 th July 2020 as per WHO (World Health Organization) situation report No. 187 and Centre for System Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, globally greater than 15.9 million cases have been stated, resulting in 643,000 deaths, 9.22 million recovered cases with United States reporting the highest number of cases around 4.17 million (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020) (Johns Hopkins CSSE, 2020) . Speaking for India as per Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, till 26 th July 2020 there are 1,385,522 confirmed cases, and 467,882 active cases, among which 32,063 deaths and 885,576 recovered cases have been reported (Policy j Ministry of Health and Family Welfare j GOI, Policy j Ministry of Health and Family Welfare j GOI, 2020Policy j Policy j Ministry of Health & Family Welfare j GOI, 2020Welfare j GOI, 2020). Coronaviruses (CoV) is the beta strain from the family Coronaviridae which leads to maladies of the vital organs like respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological systems if not treated (Chan et al., 2012; Zumla et al., 2016) . It is a single stranded RNA virus (positive sense) having diameter of 80-120 nm, among which recently SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) has arose as a universal contagion infecting humans with 3-4% mortality rate (Zhu et al., 2020) . Owing to zoonotic origins and genetic similarity, bats are pondered as the natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 . It consists of four structural proteins namely Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocaspid (N) which helps coronavirus in recognizing the receptor on the target cell, fusion with membrane receptor causing infection and further transmission within the host. As compared to SARS-CoV, novel SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2) host surface protein with affinity far greater than threshold requisite for virus infectivity, but the pathological effects of SARS-CoV-2 for causing organ damage remained to be elucidated . This binding factor is the major reason for swift transmission potentiality of the SARS-CoV-2 as compared to SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2020) . The first line of action is to hinder the latching of virus towards the host ACE-2 receptors by blocking the function of Spike proteins, which would help to trim down the figure of new cases. But in already infected case to provide remedy, target for main proteases (M pro ) are being searched out as it translates the viral RNA into functional polyproteins that alters the normal physiology of the subject by formation of viral RNA polymerase, endoribonuclease and exoribonuclease Elmezayen et al., 2020) . M pro , also called 3CL pro (3C-like protease or chymotrypsin-like protease) is a dimer owning six stranded antiparallel b barrels, holding substrate binding site in the middle of them, along with cluster of five helices which are responsible for dimerization of the enzyme. The majority of the Coronaviridae genome encodes two polyproteins, pp1a (Wrapp et al., 2020) and pp1ab (Mengist et al., 2020; Mittal et al., 2020) . With the help of two proteases 3CL pro (3-chemotrypsin-like protease) and PL pro (papain-like protease) encoded by the open reading frame, the above mentioned polyproteins are cleaved and further transformed in mature non-structural proteins (NSPs). In addition to papain-like protease(s) M pro is required for dispensing polyproteins at 11 different sites to produce proteins which are translated from the viral RNA. Restraining the pursuit of M pro would impede viral replication process inside the host (Anand et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2020) . Since no other human protease are known with similar cleavage specificity at sites of Leu-Gln#(Ser, Ala, Gly) is known till date, the inhibitors of these targets are likely to be non-toxic. Amongst the prospective protease inhibitors, the antivirals Nelfinavir, Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir along with a-ketoamide are peculiarly striking as therapeutics to battle the new coronavirus (De Oliveira et al., 2020; Mothay & Ramesh, 2020). Apart from these, combination of anti-viral such as Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Favipiravir , anti-malarial, namely Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine (Muralidharan et al., 2020) and corticosteroid like Dexamethasone (World Health Organization, 2020) therapy are being used for controlling COVID-19. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 M pro have recently emerged as the better targets in inhibiting virus replication. The present study fascinated on the main proteases of SARS-CoV-2 as potential macromolecular target for COVID-19 management using active phytoconstituents mentioned in Ayurvedic scriptures.\n",
            " Ayurveda knows as 'The Science of Life', an ancient system of medicine practiced in Indian subcontinent; based on the holistic principle of life, health, and healing system. A group of rejuvenative methods that imparts biological nourishment to the body tissues was described in Ayurvedic text (Singh et al., 2008) . It describe many medicinal plants with wide range of therapeutic potentiality in treating the ailment of respiratory system; some of the notable ones but not limited to are Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy), Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi) used in present study. They are all immunomodulators and strengthen the body against infections. W. somnifera (WS), usually known as Ashwagandha, categorized as a rasayana (rejuvenator) which was predicted to enrich physical and mental state, considered to rejuvenate the body in weakened situations and upturns longevity (Williamson, 2002) . It has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, antimicrobial, analgesic, anti-tumour, anti-stress, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, rejuvenating and immunomodulatory effects (Kapoor, 1990; Ven Murthy et al., 2010; Vyas et al., 2011; Williamson, 2002) . An active ingredient known as 'withanolides' contains steroidal saponin, alkaloids, and steroidal lactones. Most of biological action contributed by Withaferin-A and Withanolide D, along with Withanoside I-VII, new Withanolide Glycosides, extracted from its roots (Matsuda et al., 2001) . T. cordifolia (Guduchi or Giloy), is a medicinal plant which has been used for its remedial purpose for thousands of year in Ayurvedic system of medicine. Its extracts have alkaloids, glycosides, steroids and polysaccharides (Panchabhai et al., 2008) . It is well known for its immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antihepatotoxic and cytotoxic effects (Sharma et al., 2012; Thatte et al., 1992) . The active phytoconstituents, Tinocordioside, Cordifolioside A, Magnoflorine, and Syringin are known for its immunomodulatory effect (Sharma et al., 2011) . O. sanctum (Tulsi), as a sanctified herb used for its medicinal property as per Ayurvedic scriptures. It's multiple therapeutic action comprises of adaptogenic, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects (Jamshidi & Cohen, 2017) , anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity (S. Sharma, 1999) , also possess anti-diabetic, analgesic, antifertility, anticancer, antispasmodic, antiemetic, diaphoretic and hepatoprotective actions (Prakash & Gupta, 2005) . Their leaves are beneficial for the treatment of rheumatism, bronchitis, and pyrexia and considered as 'Elixir of life' for its healing power (Nadkarni & Krishnarao, 1954) . By the enhancement of both cellular and humoral immunity, it strengthens the immune response (Mukherjee et al., 2005) .\n",

            " According to previous studies it has been reported that some of the phytoconstituents from above medicinal plants shows interaction with SARS CoV-2 M pro , and other target proteins (S, E, N) of COVID-19, these phytoconstituents are Withaferin A, Withanolide B, Tinocordioside, Somniferine A, Tinosporide, Withanolide, Orientin, Flavonol glucoside, Apigenin, Kaempferol, Withanone (Dharmendra & Deepak, 2020) . It has been reported that Dihydrodieuginol B and Tulsinol A, B, C, D, E, F, G of O. sanctum could be used as potential inhibitors for Papain-like Protease and SARS Coronavirus Main Protease and Withanone from W. somnifera could be used to disrupt interconnections between Viral S-Protein RBD (receptor binding domain) and ACE2 host receptor of COVID-19 (Balkrishna et al., 2020) . With majority of world beneath lockdown and the alarming menace of millions of deaths, researchers requisite to find an effective drug more rapidly. Since SARS-CoV-2, is a new virus, more studies are required for searching the drugs to target viral systems without much side-effect to the human populations; here Ayurvedic formulations can play a significant role, for developing therapeutic moieties that would be safe and nontoxic. In this research article, with the use of in silico molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies, an attempt was made to identify new active and stable inhibitors against novel coronavirus main protease, from total 102 different active phytoconstituents from above stated medicinal plants. Thereby hindering the viral translation into functional polyproteins required for further replication of virus and disruption of host physiological/ biological functions.\n",

Build-ed systems of each complex were subjected to standard equilibration protocol (Selvaraj et al., 2018) . MD simulation was performed for the timescale of 20 nano seconds (ns) using OPLS-3e force field. The results of RMSD and hydrogen bonds were analysed using the Desmond simulation interaction analysis (Yadav et al., 2020) .\n",

            " As per YASARA scoring, molecular docking study revealed that different active phytochemicals present in W. somnifera (Ashwagandha), T. cordifolia (Giloy) and O. sanctum (Tulsi) exhibited significant binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Table 1 represents the list of phytochemicals displaying significant binding energy (>8.0 kcal/mol) with SARS-CoV-2 M pro .\n",
            " Potential inhibitors from W. somnifera (Ashwagandha) for SARS-CoV-2 M pro From molecular docking study it has been found that out of 28 compounds from W. somnifera (Ashwagandha) only two compounds namely Withanoside V (CID_10700345) and Somniferine (CID_14106343) showed significant binding affinity as compared to native N3 (CID_146025593) for SARS-CoV-2 M pro as per YASARA scoring. Withanoside V showed highest binding energy of 10.32 kcal/mol. Withanoside V is a glycoside obtained from W. somnifera roots, reported to have tachyphylaxis inhibition activity (Matsuda et al., 2001) . It forms different ligand-protein 2D-3D interactions which includes conventional and carbon hydrogen bonding with residue Asn 84, Arg 40 and Met 82, alkyl and p-alkyl interaction with Cys 85, Arg 105 and Phe 134. Numerous van der Waals interactions were also formed by remaining residues (Figure 1(a,b) ). Somniferine was found to be another inhibitor with binding energy 9.62 kcal/mol. It forms conventional, carbon and p-donor hydrogen bonding with the residues Leu 141, His 164, Thr 24, Glu 166, Asn 142, Phe 140 and His 163, alkyl and p-alkyl interaction was formed with Cys 145 and His 163. Few van der Waals interactions were formed by remaining residues (Figure 1(c,d) ).\n",
            " Potential inhibitor from T. cordifolia (Giloy) for SARS-CoV-2 M pro Among 28 active phytochemicals from T. cordifolia (Giloy), only one compound namely Tinocordiside (CID_177384) showed highest binding affinity as compared to built-in ligand N3 for SARS-CoV-2 M pro as per YASARA scoring. Tinocordiside have binding energy of 8.10 kcal/mol. Tinocordiside is found to be a new reorganized cadinane sesquiterpene glycoside from T. cordifolia (Giloy) (Ghosal & Vishwakarma, 1997) . Different 2D-3D interactions formed by Tinocordiside includes conventional and carbon hydrogen bonding with the residues Gly 143, Leu 141 and Met 165, alkyl and p-alkyl interaction were formed with Cys 145, His 41 and Leu 27. Many van der Waals interactions were formed by remaining residues (Figure 2(a,b) ).\n",
            " Out of 46 active phytochemicals from O. sanctum (Tulsi), only three compounds namely Vicenin (CID_3084407), Isorientin Ursolic acid (CID_64945) showed significant binding affinity as compared to built-in ligand N3 for SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Vicenin was found to have highest binding energy of 8.97 kcal/mol. Vicenin formed many 2D-3D interactions with the receptor protein which includes conventional, carbon and p-donor hydrogen bonding with the residues Glu 166, Thr 190, Gln 189 and Pro 168, a p-sulfur bonding with Met 165, a alkyl interaction was formed with Cys 145 and various van der Waals interactions were found to be formed by remaining residues (Figure 3(a,b) ). Second inhibitor was found to be Isorientin 4 0 -O-glucoside 2 00 -O-p-hydroxybenzoagte with binding energy 8.55 kcal/mol. It forms different 2D-3D interactions which includes positive charged hydrogen bonding with the residues Arg 40, Arg 105, Arg 188 and hydrophobic interaction with the residue Tyr 54 (Figure 4(a,b) ). Another inhibitor was found to be Ursolic acid with binding energy 8.52 kcal/mol. Ursolic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, reported to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antimicrobial, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-ulcer, hepatoprotective, anti-fungal and antimalarial activities (Prakash & Gupta, 2005 ; RJPP -Traditional Indian Herbal Plants Tulsi & Its Medicinal Importance & , 2010). It forms conventional and carbon hydrogen bonding with the residue Leu 271, alkyl and p-alkyl interaction with the residues Leu 272, Leu 287 and Tyr 239. It also formed several van der Waals interactions with the remaining residues (Figure 3(c,d) ). From molecular docking study, as per YASARA scoring, it had been clear that Withanoside V, Somniferine, Tinocordiside, Vicenin, Isorientin 4 0 -O-glucoside 2 00 -O-phydroxybenzoagte and Ursolic acid from W. somnifera (Ashwagandha), T. cordifolia (Giloy), and O. sanctum (Tulsi) predicted to acts as probable inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Structures of best docked compounds are shown in Figure 5 . Ursolic acid (CID_64945) was simulated for understanding the structural deviations in the dynamic environment for the timescale of 20 ns. Each complex deviation was recorded for RMSD from its initial position and the values were calculated and plotted simultaneously ( Figure 6 ). While observing the results, it has been found that, RMSD for the compounds shows uniqueness in the dynamic conditions. For the initial 8 ns, except the compound CID_177384 and CID_3084407, all the other compounds showed lower and stable deviations $1 to $2.5 Å. The compounds CID_177384 and CID_3084407 showed deviations up to $3Å, especially from 2 to 4 ns of the MD simulations. After 8 ns, there was visible movement in the upward direction however the stable movement was initiated between $ 1.5 and $3.5 Å. One of the notable compound, CID_64945 with two hydrogen bond donor and three hydrogen bond acceptor adopts well inside the binding pocket in the docking calculations, and the interactions were stable in the MD simulations. But compound shows much activity with the binding of loop structures in M pro binding site, and thus the deviations for the CID_64945 was seen from $3Å to $4Å in between the timescale of 10 to 20 ns of the MD simulations. Another compound CID_177384 (2-(Diethylamino)ethyl tetrahydro-alpha-(1-naphthylmethyl)-2-furanpropionate), holding three oxygen atom along with one nitrogen atom holds the active site binding, but the deviation drift occurs in 18 ns, due to the breaking of hydrogen bonds from the amino acids residues Arg 188 and Gln 189. Interestingly, in showing tight binding in the M pro peptide binding pocket. Even though the compound showed large allocation towards the binding pocket, we did not notice any unbounding in the 20 ns of the MD simulations. The compound Vicenin (CID_3084407) showed similar binding mode of CID_177384, but the drift was seen from 15 to 20 ns, due to strong bond formation with the interactions of residues Glu 166 and Asn 142. The overall RMSD of all the compounds for the timescale of 20 ns is provided in Figure 6 .\n",
            " For cognizance the reason of RMSD deviations, we have accounted hydrogen bonds between the protein-ligand complexes (Figure 7) . While observing the hydrogen bonds, it has been found that there was a strong correlation between hydrogen bonds and RMSD analysis. It has been noticed that the resemblance of hydrogen bonds getting down after 8 ns, and this had impacted the upwards movement of RMSD from the 9 to 20 ns. In order to understand the contributing amino acids residues, the MD trajectories were carefully analysed. The ligand molecule CID_44257986 showed 8-12 contacts till 10 ns, only after the hydrogen bonds are levelled between 6 and 8 hydrogen bonds. This impact was revealed in the RMSD values, but interestingly one of the amino acid residue Glu 166 was playing vital role in holding the CID_44257986 throughout the MD simulations. The CID_10700345 interaction with M pro , during the MD simulations, resulted in high residual fluctuations between the regions of 130-190th position. Here also, the amino acid residue Glu 166 was playing vital role in holding the CID_10700345, even though high deviations were seen in residual amino acid positions. The oxygen atom in the ligand CID_10700345 showed 83% of interactions with residue Glu 166 in the MD simulations, which showed significant contribution of Glu 166 in the binding. For the compound CID_3084407, hydrogen bond does not have stability except the Glu 166, but the single amino acid residue pattern holds the CID_3084407 throughout the MD simulations. In this, the other amino acid residue Gln 192, was contributing to hold Gln 166 which form hydrogen bonds with the OH atom of the ligand. The other compound CID_177384 showed tight bound in the binding pocket, but unexpectedly, we did not find a single amino acid residue that holds the ligand throughout 20 ns of the MD simulations. The amino acids residues like Asn 142, Glu 166, Arg 188, Gln 189, Gln 192 were contributing in different intervals for holding the CID_177384 inside the binding pocket. For the compound CID_14106343, the residual movements were not observed high, due to the formation of hydrophobic interactions. Especially the amino acid residues His 41, Met 49 and Met 165 were contributing in hydrophobic interactions with ligand and thus, the ligand is tightly bound inside the binding pocket. For the compound CID_14106343, the key amino \n",
            " Drug-likeness test for the best docked compounds was predicted with the help of Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET molecular property prediction test was performed out by admetSAR server. Lipinski rule of five is a thumb rule of five which aids in differentiating among drug like and non-drug like molecules by obeying its five parameters (Molecular mass, Hydrogen bond donor, Hydrogen bond acceptor, Log P and Molar refractivity); it must obey 2 or more of their parameters. Consequently best docked compounds Withanoside V, Somniferine, Tinocordiside and Vicenin, Isorientin 4 0 -O-glucoside 2 00 -O-p-hydroxybenzoagte and Ursolic acid from present study follows more than two parameters of Lipinski rule of five and hence deliberated as drug-like compounds. Additionally, best docked compounds were found to be within the standard scale considering their water solubility (LogS), human intestinal absorption (HIA), Caco-2 permeability and have no carcinogenic effects (Table 2) .\n",
            " Currently in modern medicine, both individual and combination of anti-malarial, anti-viral and corticosteroid therapy are being used for treating COVID-19. Recently as per WHO Dexamethasone (World Health Organization, 2020) has shown promising results, India based Glen mark has introduced antiviral drug Favipiravir (Glenmark launches Covid-19 drug at Rs 103 per tablet -India news -Hindustan Times, 2020) which has got regulatory approval for Phase III assessment for treating mild to moderate COVID-19 patient. Repurposing of drug for treating COVID-19 is being extensively used for managing the current cases of COVID-19. Natural product with medicinal property can be used, as toxicity profile is less in comparison to synthetic compounds. Consulting Ayurveda for treating COVID-19 provides reliable evidence-based medicinal plants for managing the ailment of respiratory disorders. In silico approach such as molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies provides fundamental starting point in terms of binding energy and stability of ligands with proteins for further research. SARS-CoV-2 M pro is important in stimulating proteolytic maturation of viral RNA into functional proteins namely RNA polymerase, endoribonuclease and exoribonuclease which also hampers the intrinsic immune system of the host. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 M pro can be deliberated as significant target as it helps in translation of polyproteins into individual functional component that subsequently forms 16 NSPs which helps in viral transcription and replication (Jo et al., 2020) .\n",
            " Present work describes the role of active phytoconstituents from Ayurvedic medicinal plants W. somnifera (Ashwagandha), T. cordifolia (Giloy), and O. sanctum (Tulsi) for treating COVID 19 pandemic. As stated earlier in this article, from various studies (Balkrishna et al., 2020; Dharmendra & Deepak, 2020; Varshney et al., 2020) some of the phytoconstituents from these medicinal plants have shown promising effect against COVID-19 targets. Present work reports phytochemicals which are different from previous studies for inhibition of M pro with significant binding affinity as per YASARA scoring. Six phytochemicals from present study namely Withanoside V, Somniferine, Tinocordiside, Vicenin, Isorientin 4 0 -O-glucoside 2 00 -O-p-hydroxybenzoagte and Ursolic acid obtained from medicinal plants, have predicted significant binding energy as compared to the native ligand N3 (Figures 1-4 , Table 1 ). The binding of these identified active phytochemicals with M pro decreases the process of viral transcription and replication by down turning the cleavage of poly proteins that release NSPs. From present work, it has been suggested that the best docked compounds obtained from Ayurvedic medicinal plants W. somnifera (Ashwagandha), T. cordifolia (Giloy) and O. sanctum (Tulsi) could be predicted to serve as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M pro , with their significant binding affinity, stable MD runs, ADMET prediction and drug-likeness properties. These phytoconstituents not only impede the interaction of viral protein to the host cell to transmit and propagate inside the human body but they are also safe to repurpose against COVID-19 without any toxicity.\n",
            " COVID-19 is an evolving disease triggered by COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and has turned into a global pandemic in the blink of eyes. SARS-CoV-2 M pro is shown to be highly potent and vital target for the inhibition of COVID-19 contamination. In present study, molecular docking analysis identified six phytochemicals (Withanoside V [10.32 kcal/mol], Somniferine [9.62 kcal/mol], Tinocordiside [8.10 kcal/mol], Vicenin [8.97 kcal/mol], Isorientin 4 0 -O-glucoside 2 00 -O-phydroxybenzoagte [8.55 kcal/mol] and Ursolic acid [8.52 kcal/ mol]) from medicinal plants with potential inhibition and high affinities towards SARS-CoV-2 M pro , predicted to restrain the action of SARS-CoV-2 M pro thereby obstructing further translation of viral protein that assists in damaging the vital organs of the host. These phytochemicals might be repurposed against COVID-19. The best docked compounds with drug-like property have harmless ADMET profile which may help in developing optimised potent COVID-19 inhibitors. During MD runs, the trajectories analysis of the studied complexes displayed structural stability. From this study, we may conclude that above stated active phytochemicals, predicted to have the potential to be repurposed as anti-COVID-19 Ayurvedic therapeutics.\n",
            " This contemporary work is executed with the aim of presenting natural phytoconstituents obtained from Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy), Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi) as a remedial option against COVID-19 a global plague.\n",
            " The existing strategies across the nations are reutilization of medicine for effective treatment and management of COVID-19. Here, natural products play a pivotal role for repurposing against this pandemic as it offers minimal and in some cases no toxicity. As the clock is ticking and earth is under lockdown, in silico studies and virtual analysis may provide evidence based management of COVID-19. It is supported by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation analysis of the above mentioned active phytoconstituents against the most utilized macromolecular target of SARS-CoV-2, i.e. main protease (M pro ) which is found to be responsible for growth of virus via proteolytic cleavage, further acting as a transit point for virus entry and replication. Targeting main protease with natural phytoconstituents would serve as checkpoint for viral entry, thereby will resist their further replication and propagation. We hope with this study one could utilize the holistic approach of Ayurvedic medicinal plant to avenge against the grimmest disease of this modern day era.\n",

            " Introduction La pandémie mondiale de COVID-19 commence à être contrôlée par une vaccination massive. Les patients atteints de maladies auto-immunes (MAI) traités par rituximab ont un risque de décès 4 fois plus élevé (2,32-7,03) et semblent ne pas avoir la même réponse humorale que les témoins sains au vaccins à ARNm. L'objectif est de comparer les réponses cellulaires et humorales au vaccin ARNm BNT 162b2 contre le COVID-19 de patients atteints de MAI traités par rituximab (RTX) ou d'autres immunosuppresseurs ou immunomodulateurs (autres IS) à des sujets contrôles.\n",
            " Les patients et les témoins sains (HC) ont été vaccinés avec le BNT162b2 aux jours 0 et 28 et prélevés aux jours 28 et 56. Les patients présentant une infection antérieure au SARS-CoV 2 ont été exclus. Les patients ont été divisés en 2 groupes : « groupe RTX » s'ils avaient reç u du RTX il y a moins d'1 an, ou « autre IS » s'ils étaient traités avec d'autres traitements. Une évaluation sérologique de la réponse vaccinale (ECLIA Cobas, Roche) et de la neutralisation (iFlash-2019-nCoV Nab, Ylho) a été réalisée. Nous avons défini un seuil ≥ 50 d'IgG anti-Spike comme la réponse au vaccin car c'est la valeur seuil au-delà de laquelle les HC avaient tous des anticorps neutralisants détectables. La réponse cellulaire T contre les peptides de la protéine Spike a été réalisée en détectant le marquage intracellulaire du TNF, de l'IFNg, de l'IL2, sur les lymphocytes T CD4 et CD8 activés. Résultats Vingt-huit contrôles et 57 patients atteints de MAI ont été inclus ; 24 patients dans le groupe rituximab et 33 dans l'autre groupe autre IS. À j56, Le groupe RTX avait significativement moins d'IgG anti-Spike (68,6 ± 110) par rapport au groupe HC (235 ± 58) (p < 0,0001) et au groupe autres IS (180 ± 100) (p = 0,0017). Le pourcentage de répondeurs était plus faible dans le groupe RTX : 29,2 % versus 79,4 % (p = 0,0003) dans le groupe autres IS et 92,2 % dans le groupe HC (p < 0,0001). Il n'y avait pas de différence de taux d'IgG anti-Spike ou de pourcentage de répondeurs entre les HC et le groupe autres IS. Parmi les T CD4 activées, le pourcentage de LT CD4 spécifiques de Spike secrétant de l'IFNg après stimulation était identique dans le groupe RTX (0,039 % [0-0,13]) et dans les groupes autre IS (0,023 % [0-0,07]) et HC (0,029 % [0-0, 07]) (p = 0,38). Il n'y avait pas non plus de différence entre les groupes concernant le pourcentage de LT CD4 spécifiques sécrétant de l'IL-2 ou du TNF. Dans le groupe RTX, le délai médian depuis la dernière perfusion de RTX était significativement plus faible chez les non-répondeurs en anticorps (81 jours [IQR 147]) par rapport aux répondeurs (231 jours [IQR 89]). Aucun des patients ayant reç u RTX au cours des 6 mois précédents n'avait de réponse IgG anti-Spike. La réponse cellulaire T n'était pas corrélée au délai depuis la dernière perfusion ou à la réponse humorale. Conclusion Chez les patients atteints de MAI vaccinés avec 2 doses de vaccin anti-COVID-19 BNT162b2, la réponse humorale était significativement altérée chez les patients traités par RTX mais pas chez les patients traités par d'autres IS. Cependant, la réponse cellulaire T CD4 n'était pas différente entre le groupe RTX et les autres groupes. Des données cliniques sont nécessaires pour juger de la protection contre la maladie chez les patients RTX ayant une réponse cellulaire sans réponse humorale. En attendant, il est justifié de proposer une 3 e dose vaccinale à tous les patients ayant reç u une injection de RTX moins de 6 mois avant la 1 re injection vaccinale.\n",

Elle provient des premiers résultats d'un registre national (étude du CRI) de patients atteints du SARS-CoV-2. Du 7 avril 2020 au 24 juin 2021, nous avons recueilli les données clinicobiologiques, morphologiques, et la prise en charge de ces manifestations. Résultats Cette étude comprend 15 patients ayant présenté une infection à SARS-CoV-2 avec haute suspicion clinique et cas contact confirmé (n = 2), confirmée par PCR nasale (n = 8), trachéale (n = 2), test salivaire (n = 1) ou sérologie (n = 2). L'âge moyen est de 55,1 ans (19-72) ; 53,3 % des patients sont de sexe féminin. Les comorbidités principales sont une hypertension artérielle (40 %), un diabète de type 2 (20 %), une obésité (20 %). Aucun patient ne présente d'antécédent de rhumatisme inflammatoire chronique sous traitement de fond, maladie auto-immune ou déficit immunitaire. Deux patients présentent un antécédent de psoriasis dans l'enfance. Le délai moyen d'apparition des manifestations rhumatologiques est de 32,9 jours après les premiers symptômes d'infection à SARS-CoV-2 et de 23,9 jours après confirmation diagnostique : arthralgies (100 %), myalgies (47 %), au moins une synovite (86 %). L'atteinte est majoritairement bilatérale (67 %), asymétrique (54 %), polyou oligo-articulaire (73 %). Trois patients présentent des signes extra-articulaires évoquant une maladie inflammatoire systémique (syndrome néphrotique, engelures, syndrome de Raynaud, papules de Gottron, télangiectasies). Un syndrome inflammatoire biologique est présent chez 80 % des patients. Un patient présente une positivité du facteur rhumatoïde à taux significatif, alors que les anticorps anti-CCP ne sont présents chez aucun d'entre eux. Les anticorps antinucléaires sont positifs à taux significatif (seuil de 1/160) chez 20 % des patients. Les radiographies ne montrent pas d'atteinte structurale. Dix patients ont bénéficié d'une évaluation échographique : sept présentent au moins une synovite, dont quatre avec hyperhémie Doppler. Une seule ponction articulaire de genou a été réalisée, retrouvant un liquide inflammatoire à prédominance de polynucléaires neutrophiles, sans cristaux. Nous disposons de données de suivi pour 12 patients. Le délai de suivi moyen par rapport au j0 des symptômes de l'infection à SARS-CoV-2 est de 15 mois (8-18).

            " Globally, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to more than 233 million infections and more than 4.7 million deaths according to the statistics of World Health Organization (WHO) as of October 1, 2021 [Ren and et al., 2021] . The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is broad: Many COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms; however, some patients progress to severe life-threatening conditions [Ren and et al., 2021] . Accurate classification of COVID-19 severity in patients may aid in delivering proper healthcare and reducing mortality. Thus it is of great importance to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease and identify the biomarkers of the illness severity accurately [de Terwangne et al., 2020] .\n",
            " Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool at dissecting the cellular processes and characterizing immune responses [Ren and et al., 2021, Niyakan et al., 2021] . Many groups have been applying scRNA-seq to COVID-19 studies to better understand the human immune response to the infection [Ren and et al., 2021 , Wauters et al., 2021 , Cao et al., 2020 . A recent study performed scRNA-seq on Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of patients with different COVID-19 severity levels to characterize the respiratory immune properties associated with COVID-19 severity [Liao et al., 2020] .\n",

We apply several classification algorithms, including linear classifiers, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and non-linear ones, such as Quadratic and Flexible Discriminant Analysis (QDA and FDA [Hastie et al., 1994] ), Random Forests (RF) [Breiman, 2001] and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate our pipeline in classifying BALF cells based on COVID-19 severity. \n",
            " We have used the scBALF-COVID-19 dataset prepared for the single-cell transcriptomics challenge of the IEEE COVID-19 Data Hackathon. This dataset is derived from public data [Liao et al., 2020] and contains a set of Broncho Alveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) cells from patients categorized clinically as having mild, severe or no COVID-19 infection. In detail, the dataset has scRNA-seq data of 23189 BALF cells from three classes based on COVID-19 severity: mild infection (3292 cells), severe infection (7919 cells), and no infection (11978 cells) across 1999 genes. The dataset has been normalized for technical differences between patients (batch normalization) as well as sequencing depth differences between cells in each patient. This normalization step, has removed the overdispersion inherent in typical scRNA-seq data. As a result, it may not be beneficial to apply typical scRNA-seq tools for biomarker identification and cell clustering on this normalized data set, such as scVI [Lopez et al., 2018] , DESeq2 [Love et al., 2014] and SimCD [Niyakan et al., 2021] , in which Negative Binomial (NB) distribution models and their extensions were developed to model scRNA-seq data. As shown in the histogram plot of normalized gene expression values for a random gene \"CXCR1\" in the left plot of Fig 1, normalized gene expression profiles across samples can be approximated with a normal distribution.\n",
            " At the first step of our proposed pipeline, we detect genes that are differentially expressed (DE) across cells with different levels of COVID-19 severity. In order to do this we perform three different sets of DE analyses, each time as one label vs the rest (e.g. severe cells vs other cells). DE analyses are based on the R package Monocle [Qiu et al., 2017] designed specifically for scRNA-seq experiments with the capability of handling normally distributed data. This can be done by passing the argument expressionFamily to be uninormal. In detail, what Monocle does for DE analyses is fitting vector generalized linear models (VGLM) to both full and reduced models and then computing likelihood ratio Chi-squared statistics and corresponding p-values. After that, for each of three analyses, we rank genes based on their adjusted p-values in an increasing order. Then we report the intersection of top 100 DE genes (also having lower adjusted p-values) in all three DE analyses as COVID-19 severity potential biomarkers.\n",
            " After identifying the candidate genes as biomarkers to classify BALF cells for COVID-19 infection severity, we run various well-known classifiers, including both linear and non-linear classifiers. We first run LDA as it assumes that predictors are normally distributed and that the different classes have class-specific means and equal variance. Then we try multiple non-linear classifiers, including QDA, FDA, RF and SVM with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel to better capture the non-linearity in the data. For LDA and QDA, we use lda and qda from the R package MASS. For FDA, we use fda with the regression method to be multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), from R package mda. For RF, we use randomForest function from a R package with the same name. We perform SVM with RBF, with the svm from the R package e1071. Also, it worth mentioning that in order to account for the imbalance in class labels we set the option class.weights to be inverse so that weights for samples with different class labels be chosen inversely proportional to the corresponding class size.\n",
            " In this section, we present the results of applying our bioinformatics pipeline discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 to the BALF cell scRNA-seq data. First, we discuss the biomarker identification results and then go over the results of cell classification tools.\n",
            " After applying the DE analyses detailed in Section 2.2, we end up having 12 genes in the intersection set of top 100 DE genes in three sets of DE analyses performed by Monocle: RSAD2, CXCL10, IDO1, GCH1, CXCL11, CRYBA4, CCL3, LGMN, IFIT1, CTSB, GBP1 and CCL2. Half of these genes (RSAD2, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL3, IFIT1, CCL2) have been previously reported as genetic biomarkers for COVID-19 severity in a recent study that profiled the immune response signatures in the BALF cells of eight COVID-19 cases [Zhou et al., 2020] . The rest of the genes detected by our pipeline can be new potential biomarkers for immune response to COVID-19 in BALF cells. The middel and right box plots in Fig. 1 show the normalized gene expression values of GBP1 and RSAD2, two identified potential biomarkers by our pipeline. RSAD2 has been previously studied to be associated with respiratory immune response severity in BALF cells but GBP1 can be a new potential biomarker.\n",
            " After having the ranking lists of genes based on their adjusted p-values in three sets of one class vs rest DE analyses, we make three different sets of candidate gene features for cell classification: Applying these to our BALF scRNA-seq data, we find 12, 88 and 194 genes in the gene sets G1, G2 and G3 respectively. Venn diagram of top 100 DE genes from the three sets of DE analyzes is shown in left plot of Figure 2 . We then apply the previously described classification algorithms in Section 2.3 with the gene expression values from each of the gene sets to classify cells. In order to measure the accuracy of each classifier by each of three gene sets, we first randomly split data to 75% and 25% of the total size of the available cell samples to construct training and test sample sets. Then for each gene set and each classifier, we train the classifier three times (each time one label vs the rest) on the training set and calculate area under Receiver Operator Characteristic (AUC-ROC) values by testing the trained model on the test data. In each case of label comparison, classification algorithm and gene set, we run the code three times and then report the average and standard deviations of AUC-ROC values. Table 1 shows these AUC-ROC values for each of combinations of running one of five different classifiers on three gene sets. As it was expected, the linear classifier LDA has the worst performance in comparison with non-linear ones. Furthermore, as we expect, almost for all classifiers the AUC-ROC is higher when using the gene set G3 comparing to other two gene sets G1 and G2. Similar trends when comparing the results using G2 vs G1. This is reasonable as Table.1) the numbers of genes (biomarkers/features) in the gene sets G2 and G3 are 7 and 16 times higher than the number of genes in the gene set G1, respectively. Actually, the performance of RF, SVM with the RBF kernel, and FDA on the gene set G1, which only has 12 genes, show the practicality of our proposed biomarker identification approach to detect COVID-19 severity in BALF cells. Table 1 , also presents the superior performance of the random forest classification algorithm on dissecting BALF cells based on their COVID-19 severity. Also, it worth mentioning that one can almost accurately classify BALF cells, by running the RF algorithm on the proposed set of genes from the biomarker identification step in our bioinformatics pipeline.\n",
            " Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 infection across the world and daily increasing number of mortality in the patients having the infection, it is of great importance to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms in human immune response to this infection. As a result of this, here, we presented a bioinformatics pipeline, capable of first, identifying potential COVID-19 severity biomarkers in BALF cells and secondly, accurately classifying cells based on the constructed set of genes. The proposed pipeline is implemented in R and all the codes are available in the Github page: https://github.com/namini94/scBALF_Hackathon.\n",

            " El mundo actual se está enfrentando a una de las mayores amenazas de los últimos años. La pandemia por Covid-19 ha afectado a todos los ámbitos de la vida; social, político, económico y especialmente en materia de salud, donde ha supuesto una gran crisis a nivel mundial que ha provocado situaciones de colapso de los sistemas sanitarios.\n",
            " Toda la población, sin distinción, se ha visto afectada por la pandemia. Pero los profesionales de la salud han tenido que enfrentarse a su cara más negativa: la muerte, la soledad, el miedo, el riesgo de contagio y la sobrecarga de trabajo. Sobrellevar el día a día de la actividad asistencial en hospitales, centros socio-sanitarios o atención primaria, ha sido difícil y el impacto producido, enorme. A finales de 2020 el Consejo Internacional de Enfermeras, en una estimación que consideraba ''a la baja'', ''ya que contemplaba únicamente datos de 44 de los 195 países que existen, anunciaba que ya habían fallecido en el mundo por Covid-19 tantas enfermeras como en la Primera Guerra Mundial'', donde fallecieron 1.500 enfermeras 1 . Más allá de los fallecimientos, el impacto se refleja también en los problemas de salud mental derivados de la pandemia, fruto de las experiencias y condiciones laborales adversas que las enfermeras han afrontado desde marzo de 2020, impacto que en nuestro país se estima afecta al 80% de las enfermeras 2 .\n",
            " A pesar de todo, durante estos meses, las enfermeras han sabido estar ahí, siempre presentes, en primera línea, gracias a su capacidad de resiliencia, que les ha permitido superar las adversidades, aprender de ellas y adquirir la fortaleza necesaria para continuar, porque era necesario hacerlo. Y así lo han hecho, desempeñando un papel excepcional durante toda la pandemia, demostrando su capacidad de adaptación a esta nueva situación, ejerciendo como verdadero motor de cambio, planificando y liderando las continuas modificaciones organizativas que imponía el Covid-19 3 .\n",
            " Durante este tiempo las enfermeras han recuperado su visibilidad, tanto en el exterior como en el interior de las propias instituciones sanitarias. La población ha sido testigo de la actividad desarrollada por las enfermeras y el lugar que ocupa en los diferentes ámbitos de trabajo. Sin embargo, todavía queda mucho por avanzar en reconocimiento y visibilidad de las enfermeras. Un análisis de las fuentes y temas sanitarios en los informativos de Radiotelevisión Española (RTVE) emitidos entre el 31 diciembre 2019 y el 8 junio 2020 revela la falta de visibilidad de los profesionales de salud en la cobertura informativa televisiva en España sobre el Covid-19, siendo la prioridad temas de política y de los propios políticos 4 .\n",
            " Pero una vez que lo peor ha pasado, llega el momento de echar la vista atrás, de reflexionar y sobre todo, de espehttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2021.12.003 1130-8621/© 2021 El Autor(s). Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U. Este es un artículo Open Access bajo la licencia CC BY-NC-ND (http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). rar una respuesta a la pregunta ¿y ahora qué?. Hoy más que nunca vemos las carencias de nuestro sistema, las cuales se han hecho más evidentes durante este periodo de crisis sanitaria. La pandemia ha puesto de relevancia sistemas sanitarios que explotan el trabajo físico y emocional de sus enfermeras, sin darse cuenta que las enfermeras no son un recurso inagotable 5 . Desde hace muchos años la ratio de enfermeras por habitante en España está lejos del de otros países europeos, lo que se traduce en una importante sobrecarga de trabajo. Las enfermeras de los hospitales españoles tienen a su cargo el mayor número de pacientes en comparación al resto de países europeos, oscilando entre 9,5 y 17,9 pacientes por enfermera 6 . Ya en 2013, en el último gran estudio realizado en 60 hospitales del Sistema Nacional de Salud, la cuarta parte de las enfermeras afirmaban que, si pudieran, dejarían su trabajo en el hospital en el próximo año 7 .\n",
            " A esto se suma un sistema de contratación que no responde a la experiencia y especialidad de las enfermeras, con rotaciones demasiado frecuentes de puesto de trabajo y con escasa continuidad a pesar del nivel de desempeño. Sin mencionar el trato (o mejor dicho, el ''mal trato'') dado en muchas comunidades autónomas a las enfermeras que han estado en primera línea con los denominados ''contratos covid''. El sistema en general y los que lo gobiernan, en particular, con los actuales criterios de gestión de recursos humanos, parecen vivir de espaldas a la evidencia que pone de manifiesto que el coste asociado a la rotación de una enfermera ronda los 80 mil euros, en concepto de costes ligados a la contratación de una nueva enfermera y la pérdida de productividad, tanto de la nueva enfermera, como de las compañeras, que deben asumir la tutorización y las funciones de ésta hasta que alcance el nivel de especialidad que tenía la anterior 8 .\n",
            " Las enfermeras piden ahora que alguien cuide de ellas para que puedan continuar cuidando. Es fundamental que nuestro sistema sanitario alcance las cifras de enfermeras de otros países europeos, para lo cual debería contratar miles de ellas, pero también es fundamental que las condiciones de trabajo mejoren. En un estudio realizado por Aiken 9 se evidencia que si el entorno de trabajo es malo, por mucho que se incremente el número de enfermeras, los resultados en los pacientes no mejoran. Sin embargo, en entornos de trabajo saludables, la mejora de la ratio de enfermeras tiene como consecuencia una disminución clara de la mortalidad de los pacientes. Y somos conscientes de que una parte de la mejora del entorno de trabajo es consecuencia de la mejora de la ratio, pero solo una parte. Además, un buen entorno de trabajo es aquel en el que la enfermera tiene autonomía, existe liderazgo enfermero, colaboración interprofesional e interés por una mejora de la calidad de cuidados. A este respecto, entre 15 países europeos, España era el tercer país con peor valoración de la calidad de cuidados por parte de sus enfermeras 10 .\n",
            " Sin ninguna duda, la mejora de la ratio de enfermeras y la consecuente mejora en la calidad de cuidados, es una de las medidas prioritarias para mejorar las condiciones de trabajo de las enfermeras 11 . Pero la evidencia también apunta hacia un apoyo y motivación por parte de las gestoras y la presencia de una figura de supervisión y apoyo clínico 11 . La necesidad de las enfermeras gestoras de contar con nuevos perfiles enfermeros que les ayuden a formar a su personal en calidad de cuidados ha sido abordada por sistemas sanitarios de otros países con ayuda de la enfermera de práctica avanzada 12 . Estas figuras tienen el potencial de producir cambios organizativos que contribuyan a la mejora del cuidado, fomentando la implementación de la evidencia en la práctica y ejerciendo de mentoras y formadoras para otras enfermeras y profesionales de la salud 13 .\n",
            " La pandemia ha revelado la necesidad de proteger a los profesionales de la salud, y en especial, a las enfermeras. Son necesarias medidas políticas y económicas que permitan mejorar las condiciones de trabajo de este colectivo y potenciar su figura 14 dentro y fuera de las organizaciones sanitarias. Avances que redundarán en una mejora de la calidad de los cuidados y, en definitiva, de los resultados de salud de la población.\n",
            " En conclusión, que la pandemia no empañe un 2020 declarado como el Año de la Enfermería y la Matrona por la OMS, y que se convierta en un hito histórico en el empoderamiento de las enfermeras y su cuidado. Ahora es el momento de que se realicen las acciones políticas y los cambios estructurales necesarios y se siga trabajando para visibilizar a las enfermeras y conseguir su merecido reconocimiento profesional y social.\n",

Currently, 10-15% of those affected develop severe disease, and worldwide mortality is around 6%. 1 Transmission of the causal virus -severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -is primarily by contact with droplets, fomites and to a lesser degree, aerosol generation. 2 For health care workers, aerosol generation during airway management is a significant concern. In cardiothoracic surgery there are particular procedures that are high risk for aerosol generation and hence transmission of COVID-19. In order to protect staff, it is important to minimise these procedures if possible, or ensure that they are conducted in a suitable environment with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). While screening tools are available to assess the risk of a patient contracting COVID-19, transmission can occur from asymptomatic patients, albeit at low risk. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons has published guidelines for the management of surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. 3 Here, we discuss issues specific to cardiothoracic surgery; key recommendations are summarised in Box 1.\n",
            " Group committee on 12 April 2020 revealed wide variability in the management of cardiothoracic surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following discussions with the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons committee, it was felt that despite recommendations in airway management and ventilation, there was limited information and guidance for the management of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery and the potential for prolonged and ongoing exposure during these procedures. A need for guidance in this subspecialty group during the pandemic was identified.\n",
            " A panel of six experts (three cardiothoracic anaesthetists and three cardiothoracic surgeons) was assembled from different states and hospitals across Australia to review national guidance, consensus recommendations and current literature on aerosol generation relevant to cardiothoracic surgery and the management of patients during the COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks.\n",
            " Articles reviewed were of low or very low quality evidence according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, consisting mainly of observational data and expert opinion. Our recommendations were based on the principles outlined in these publications combined with expert opinion and experience in the subspecialty of cardiothoracic surgery.\n",
            " Our recommendations were then referred to the Anaesthetic Continuing Education Cardiac Thoracic Vascular and Perfusion Special Interest Group and Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons executive committees, comprising cardiothoracic anaesthetists and surgeons from across Australia and New Zealand, for review and comment. The final consensus statement has been endorsed by these bodies. We acknowledge that as evidence and knowledge regarding COVID-19 continues to evolve, guidance may change.\n",
            " Guidelines regarding PPE have been produced by individual state government health authorities (eg, the New South Wales Clinical Excellence Commission and the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services) in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 4, 5 PPE type is classified as standard, contact, droplet or airborne precautions. Formal training is essential and donning and doffing procedures should be strictly followed. N95 and P2 masks should be fit tested and fit checked each time they are applied. 6 The most effective protection is frequent and effective hand hygiene. 7\n",
            " Risk stratification is paramount in patients presenting for cardiothoracic surgery. The definitions for confirmed, probable and suspected cases can be found in the Communicable Diseases Network Australia national guidelines. 8 High risk patients include:\n",
            " • patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection; • symptomatic patients without a negative swab or clearance from an infectious disease specialist or department;\n",
            " • asymptomatic patients with epidemiological risk factors; and • unconscious patients unable to provide risk screening information, specifically patients presenting with trauma and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n",
            " The merit of performing routine reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing of all patients planned for cardiothoracic surgery is debatable. Interpreting the result depends on the accuracy of the test and the pre-test probability of disease. It may allow positive patients to be identified and timing of surgery to be reconsidered due to the high specificity. 9 A single negative test result, however, should not be used as to rule out patients with strongly suggestive symptoms. A systematic review of the accuracy of COVID-19 tests reported false negative rates of between 2% and 54%. 10 Currently, risk stratification according to the patient's clinical circumstances and local COVID-19 epidemiology is the most appropriate strategy.\n",
            " The majority of cardiothoracic surgical cases are performed for prognostic reasons. The timing of these procedures will depend on a balance between the benefit to the patient, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, resource availability, and local government restrictions.\n",
            " As COVID-19 can present with both cardiac and respiratory symptoms, it is vital that patients are appropriately screened and that a differential diagnosis of COVID-19 be considered. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons recommends that positive or suspected patients be managed conservatively, if possible, with their surgery delayed. 3 If emergency surgery is required then patients should be risk assessed. It should be remembered that acute coronary syndrome is a common cardiac manifestation of COVID-19. 11 A statement from the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand provides guidance on the management of such patients. 11 Data on the risk of COVID-19-positive patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery are limited, although high peri-operative mortality is suggested. A study from Wuhan in patients undergoing non-cardiac elective surgery during the incubation period of COVID-19 demonstrated a 44% intensive care requirement and 20% mortality. 12\n",
            " Most SARS-CoV-2 spread is likely to be direct or indirect (fomite) contact or droplet spread. The World Health Organization indicates that airborne spread may occur but only during aerosolgenerating procedures. 2 Clinical risk data on aerosol risk of transmission are summarised in a systematic review of severe acute respiratory syndrome, 13 although the ten studies included were classified by GRADE as very low quality evidence. Procedures presenting an increased risk of transmission included tracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, manual ventilation before intubation and tracheostomy.\n",
            " The mechanisms responsible for the generation of aerosolised particles require disruption of the surface tension of the respiratory tract lining fluid. 14 This may be caused by high shear forces or manual or mechanical disruption during lung surgery.\n",
            " A number of procedures are at a high risk of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery. These include bag-mask ventilation; tracheal intubation; tracheal extubation; bronchoscopy; lung isolation; continuous positive airway pressure; lung recruitment or reinflation; lung injury, air leak, bronchopleural fistula or decortication; and chest drain management.\n",
            " The magnitude and spread of SARS-CoV-2 will vary greatly over time and geographical location and, therefore, advice may change with respect to low risk patients undergoing procedures at high risk of aerosol generation, depending on the community 1 Key recommendations General considerations:\n",
            " • The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Patient and staff management principles should be applied in the light of the specific regional and temporal context of the pandemic.\n",
            " • Patient risk stratification is important and may be guided by national guidelines. 8 • Local prevalence may be used to guide decisions around routine pre-operative testing.\n",
            " • Most SARS-CoV-2 spread is likely to be contact or droplet related. Aerosol spread is likely to be of lower overall frequency but certain procedures, during thoracic surgery especially, present a high risk of aerosol generation.\n",
            " • Conservative management or considered delay of confirmed or suspected COVID-19-positive patients may benefit patients and health care workers.\n",
            " • COVID-19 theatre planning should consider theatre airflow, contamination zones, theatre personnel present, additional staff roles, personal protective equipment and appropriate staff briefings.\n",
            " Procedural considerations:\n",
            " • Experienced clinicians in cardiothoracic anaesthesia and surgery should be involved in the operative care of cardiothoracic surgical COVID-19 patients.\n",
            " • Aerosols may be highest around intubation, extubation and open circuits, which are often a part of thoracic anaesthesia. Steps should be taken to minimise required disconnections and/or aerosolisation during these periods.\n",
            " • The aerosol risk from transoesophageal echocardiography may be amplified by coughing and gagging. It is appropriate to consider the riskbenefit balance for transoesophageal echocardiography and practical interventions to reduce risk.\n",
            " • Aerosol generation may occur with surgical opening of the lungs and surgical trauma. Predefined procedures to respond to such scenarios should be considered and practised.\n",
            " • The risk of viral transmission via cardiopulmonary bypass circuit oxygenators is unknown. Scavenging similar to that attached to anaesthetic machines may minimise potential risk.\n",
            " • Chest drain management should include the use of viral filters on the chest drain exhaust to minimise the risk of aerosolisation of the virus. transmission and the potential for asymptomatic patients attending for procedures.\n",
            " Due to the number and frequency of aerosolising procedures performed during thoracic surgery, we believe this surgery, in particular, has the potential to generate high volumes of prolonged and ongoing aerosol generation. As such, in areas or times when risk of community transmission is high, it may be reasonable to adopt airborne precautions for all thoracic patients irrespective of COVID-19 status to protect staff. 15 Management of such patients should be in keeping with national, regional and institutional policies and with recognition of the requirement to conserve PPE.\n",
            " There should be a designated operating room to manage COVID-19 patients, with a protocol for patient flow to and from the operating room. 16 Negative (or neutral) pressure rooms are preferred. Dirty and clean buffer zones should be observed and staff and equipment should be kept to a minimum. Disposable equipment should be used where available and clean runners should be available to provide additional instruments, drugs and equipment.\n",
            " Team briefings are important. These should aim to introduce the team, discuss the surgery, identify aerosolising procedures, and review protocols. Communication may be difficult in PPE and this should be recognised.\n",
            " The peak risk period during cardiac surgical procedures is intubation and extubation. The Safe Airway Society has produced guidelines for airway management in the COVID-19 environment. 17 Intubation and extubation processes should follow these accepted guidelines to minimise aerosolisation. There should be a wait time, if possible, for the aerosol risk to subside, with a recommendation of three to five air changes (about 15 minutes). 15 When transferring intubated patients to the intensive care unit, the number and duration of breathing circuit disconnections should be minimised, with processes to prevent aerosols as per Safe Airway Society guidance. 17\n",
            " Lung isolation can be achieved by a number of measures. Options include left-or right-sided double lumen tubes, bronchial blockers, or a single lumen tube advanced into the nonoperative lung. 18 The European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology has published recommendations for airway management in thoracic anaesthesia. 19 A survey conducted by the Association showed that the choice of lung isolation management is likely to be influenced by the intubation status of the patient, predicted airway difficulty and individual preference. 19 Many steps involved in the achievement and troubleshooting of lung isolation are high aerosolising procedures. There are a number of adaptations that we suggest be adopted to minimise this.\n",
            " Intubation should be undertaken as per Safe Airway Society guidance, with an experienced thoracic anaesthetist. Clinical assessment of double lumen tube placement can be performed by inspecting and auscultating, while sequentially clamping the tracheal and bronchial arms without disconnection. This may avoid the need for bronchoscopy.\n",
            " Another option is to confirm lung ventilation with ultrasound, looking for lung sliding (ventilation) and absence of lung sliding and lung pulse (no ventilation but no pneumothorax). 20 If bronchoscopy is required for positioning or troubleshooting, this should be performed with the ventilator disabled, without positive pressure on the circuit, and with the patient adequately paralysed.\n",
            " Double lumen tubes with embedded cameras may reduce the requirement for bronchoscopy. 21 There will be a learning curve associated with these devices. Although they may reduce the aerosol risk during placement, they are not a substitute for the wider use of bronchoscopy during thoracic surgery.\n",
            " During lung isolation, we recommend that viral filters be placed on each limb of the double lumen tube to protect against aerosols during deflation and any leak of ventilated gas. Paediatric filters may be useful to reduce the weight and kinking of the tube (Box 2, A). Application of continuous positive airway pressure to the non-ventilated lung, if required, should be performed with the filter in place.\n",
            " Suctioning of the lung is often required and we recommend using closed in-line suction. This should be inserted with the ventilator disabled and the tube clamped to minimise aerosol generation (Box 2, B) . The patient should be adequately paralysed to prevent coughing. Self-sealing suction-safe connectors can also be placed to minimise circuit disconnections.\n",
            " Any thoracic surgical procedure where there is presence or creation of alveolar, parenchymal or bronchopleural leak should be considered an open airway and high risk for aerosol generation. This includes lung resection surgery, decortication and pneumothorax surgery. While many surgeons use lung resection techniques that minimise an open bronchial tree or alveolar leak, these cannot guarantee freedom from aerosols. Pulmonary decortication is frequently associated with alveolar air leak and should be considered very high risk. Airborne PPE should be employed for these procedures.\n",
            " Bronchoscopy is at high risk for aerosol generation and should be minimised. 17 We recommend all bronchoscopy should be videoscopic, with airborne PPE employed. Rigid bronchoscopy is very high risk and should be avoided.\n",
            " If virus is present in the pleural space then there is risk of aerosolisation at the chest drain exhaust. 22 Chest drain insertion, even by careful closed technique, is a risk. When an underwater drain bottle is on suction, the risk is minimal; however, if the bottle is open to air then risk exists, which will be higher with any air leak.\n",
            " To minimise risk, a viral filter can be applied to the exhaust vent. 22 Suction can then be connected to the filter exhaust (Box 3). The resistance of the viral filter up to a flow of 30 L/min has been found to be trivial, correlating with clinical experience that the filter does not impede airflow out of the chest. 23 It is important, however, that filters be checked and changed daily.\n",
            " Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) carries a high risk of aerosol generation in an awake or sedated patient because of the risk of coughing. In an anaesthetised, paralysed patient with a cuffed endotracheal tube, the risk is currently unknown, and some regions have determined TOE in intubated patients to be non-aerosolising.\n",
            " The American and British Societies of Echocardiography, however, consider TOE to be an aerosol-generating procedure regardless of intubation status. 24, 25 Both societies recommend airborne precautions and the most experienced sonographer to perform the TOE.\n",
            " We recommend that the requirement for TOE be considered on an individual case basis rather than routine utilisation. If necessary, practical interventions to prevent cross-infection can be considered, including plastic TOE covers, dedicated equipment, a two-person technique to manipulate probe and acquire images, a plastic barrier over the patient during manipulation, and probe removal and decontamination protocols.\n",
            " There is some evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in blood. 26 It is also possible for the virus to cross the membrane and aerosolise through the gas exit port of the membrane lung during cardiopulmonary bypass, although the risk is extremely low. 26 The Australian and New Zealand College of Perfusionists has produced a statement on this matter. 27 As per existing guidelines, it is recommended that oxygenators be scavenged similarly to anaesthetic ventilators. 28\n",
            " Lung trauma may occur at many stages during cardiac surgery. Although there are limited data, we believe that an open pleural space without air leak is relatively low risk for aerosols. However, lung injury may occur on opening the pleura, internal thoracic artery harvest and sternal wire placement. Staff conducting cardiac surgery on patients at high risk of COVID-19 should employ airborne PPE. Inadvertent lung injury in patients at low risk of COVID-19 can be managed with standard PPE, with an appropriate protocol in place for visceral pleura breach in times and regions of high community transmission. A suggested approach would be to stop ventilation, pack lung, recommence ventilation at low tidal volume, adopt airborne precautions, temporarily discontinue ventilation, seal air leak, and recommence ventilation.\n",
            " Training of junior doctors is always a high priority. Care must be taken in the current environment that this is always done with safety in mind. Appropriate case selection and consideration of the duration of operations are important. Procedures that are high risk of aerosol generation and spread of COVID-19 are not appropriate for allocation to trainees.\n",
            " There are a number of procedures that represent a high risk of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery. It is important to follow recommendations to reduce that risk and protect health care workers involved in these procedures.\n",

            " A pandemia sobrecarregou os sistemas de saúde em todo o mundo e realçou as fraquezas (ou a falta) da base de dados nacional e das práticas de prevenção e controle de infecções (PCI) em ILPIs (7) .\n",

            " As taxas de mortalidade aumentaram significativamente entre os idosos mais frágeis e entre os que vivem em instituições mais lotadas (9) . Além disso, observou-se que a probabilidade de ocorrência de casos de COVID-19 é maior em instituições grandes, sem fins lucrativos e em regiões metropolitanas. Corroborando esses achados, examinaram-se as características das ILPIs norteamericanas com casos documentados de COVID-19 e descobriram que as infecções estavam relacionadas à localização (urbana) e ao tamanho (maior que 50 leitos) das instituições (1) .\n",

            " En búsqueda de fuentes de información y datos desagregados por sexo respecto a la infección por COVID-19, hoy, 19 de abril de 2020, he visitado la web del CIBERESP. Sorprendentemente, en su buscador solo aparecen tres menciones referidas a la misma noticia referente a las ayudas a la movilidad intra-CIBERESP 2020. En coherencia con las medidas de salud pública promovidas por las autoridades sanitarias frente a COVID-19 se especifica que las convocatorias de ayudas a la movilidad quedan en suspenso hasta nuevo aviso, lo cual es comprensible; no lo es tanto el no encontrar más información. ¿Qué está haciendo el CIBERESP con relación al COVID-19? Estoy segura de que muchos de sus investigadores y grupos están trabajando en ello, como hacen otras instituciones relacionadas de manera directa o indirecta con la salud y la ciencia. Es el caso del Ministerio de Sanidad y el Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación; de las Consejerías de Sanidad de las Comunidades Autónomas; de las revistas científicas internacionales de alto impacto que han puesto a disposición en abierto el conocimiento que diariamente se va publicando; o de la propia revista Gaceta Sanitaria, que ha creado un espacio de contenido especial sobre COVID-19 1,2 . La misión del CIBERESP es constituir una estructura de investigación en red mediante acciones de coordinación, colaboración y gestión estratégica de los grupos de investigación distribuidos por toda la geografía. Más que nunca, y de manera urgente, el CIBERESP debe estar presente en la crisis del COVID-19 haciendo visibles los proyectos y la producción científica de sus grupos de investigación.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Em dezembro de 2019, o surto do COVID-19 na China foi noticiado [26] . Devido ao rápido espalhamento do vírus no mundo, a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) declarou estado de emergência. Recentes pesquisas confirmaram que a atual pandemia pode dobrar o número de pessoas infectadas a cada 7 (sete) dias e que cada paciente pode espalhar o vírus, na média, para 2.2 outras pessoas [37] . Na América Latina, houve o registro de 718,615 casos de COVID-19 e 39,229 mortes confirmadas até o dia 25 de maio de 2020 [28] . No continente, o Brasilé o país mais afetado pela doença. De acordo com o mesmo relatório [28] , houve o registro de 347,398 casos de infectados e de 22,013 mortes no Brasil.\n",
            " Devido a propagação da doença no mundo, as plataformas de mídias sociais como Twitter, Facebook e Instagram tornaram-se locais onde ocorre uma intensa e contínua troca de informações entreórgãos governamentais, profissionais daárea de saúde e o público em geral. Um representativo número de estudos científicos têm mostrado que as mídias sociais podem desempenhar um papel importante como fonte de dados para análise de crises e também para entender atitudes e comportamentos das pessoas durante uma pandemia [22, 19, 12] .\n",
            " Com o objetivo de auxiliar o monitoramento da saúde pública e também para dar suporte a tomada de decisão de profissionais, diversos sistemas de monitoramento vêm sendo desenvolvidos para classificar grandes quantidades de dados oriundos das mídias sociais. Estes dados podem ser empregados para identificar rapidamente os pensamentos, atitudes, sentimentos e tópicos que ocupam as mentes das pessoas em relaçãoà pandemia do COVID-19 [3] . A análise sistemática desses dados pode ajudar os governantes, profissionais da saúde e o público em geral a identificar questões que mais lhes interessam e tratá-las de maneira mais apropriada. arXiv:2012.05836v1 [cs.SI] 20 Nov 2020 TECHNICAL REPORT -11 DE DEZEMBRO DE 2020 Dentre as plataformas de mídias sociais, o Twitteré uma das mais populares. De acordo com [14] , existe aproximadamente 200 milhões de usuários registrados nesta plataforma e que publicam mais de 500 milhões de tuítes diariamente. Portanto, pode-se aproveitar desse alto volume e troca frequente de informações para se conhecer as dúvidas sobre determinadas crises. Como exemplo de importância desta plataforma em situações de crise, a atual pandemia de COVID-19 foi primeiro comunicada para a populacão na China através do site Weibo, queé o correspondente ao Twitter na China, antes mesmo do pronunciamento oficial das autoridades locais. Recentemente, existe um grande interesse de pesquisadores investigando o uso do Twitter para pesquisas relacionadasà saúde pública [3, 22, 27, 23] .\n",
            " Diante deste cenário, nós apresentamos um estudo exploratório de mineração de opinião das mensagens de usuários do Twitter relacionadasà COVID-19. Mais especificamente, nós focamos a nossa análise nas perguntas dos usuários, pois entendemos que seja um tipo de mensagem apropriado para se compreender as principais dúvidas das pessoas sobre a atual pandemia. A nossa análise se concentrará em postagens em português pelo fato do Brasil ser o país mais populoso da América Latina e também o país mais afetado pela COVID-19. Para isto, nós coletamos e processamos os tuítes postados em português de 1 o de janeiro a 30 de abril de 2020. Os tuítes coletados foram processados e as perguntas foram identificadas. Nós analisamos os tuítes coletados usando a técnica de modelagem de tópicos para identificar os principais tópicos discutidos pelas pessoas no Twitter. Nós ainda desenvolvemos um modelo de Reconhecimento de Entidades Mencionadas (REM) que permite identificar as principais menções a um grupo pré-definido de entidades: a) doenças; b) medicamentos; c) pessoas; d) organizações. A análise desses dados pode ajudar os formuladores de políticas públicas e as organizações de assistência médica a compreender as principais questões do público em geral.\n",
            " Dentre as nossas descobertas, nós conseguimos identificar a mudança da percepção dos usuários, ao longo do tempo, em relaçãoà doença. A preocupação com a morte somente ficou evidenciada após o registro, em março de 2020, do primeiro caso de brasileiro morto por COVID-19. Foi possível ainda perceber que, ao aplicarmos a identificação das entidades nomeadas das perguntas, há muita dúvida sobre os tipos de medicamentos que poderiam ser utilizados para combater a doença. A identificação das dúvidas mais comuns sobre o uso dos medicamentos poderia ajudar os agentes públicos no enfretamento da doença através, por exemplo, de campanhas publicitárias para elucidação dos principais questionamentos.\n",
            " Resumidamente, as contribuições deste trabalho são: \n",
            " Modelagem de tópicosé uma das técnicas mais empregadas na mineração de dados, descoberta de dados latentes, e identificação de relacionamentos entre dados e documentos textuais [17] . Nós adotamos o modelo Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [5] para identificar os tópicos relevantes sobre a COVID-19 no nosso conjunto de dados. LDA permite descobrir tópicos latentes usando a distribuição de probabilidade multinomial dos termos em documentos não estruturados. Similarmente aos métodos descritos em [36] e [27] , nós executamos os experimentos variando o número de tópicos. Nos nossos experimentos, nós aplicamos a variação de tópicos de 1 a 60, e selecionamos o modelo com o maior valor de pontuação de coerência (coherence score). A geração dos tópicos foi executada para cada mês com o objetivo de identificar a mudança dos tópicos discutidos no Twitter ao longo do quadrimestre.\n",
            " Nós selecionamos o modelo que gerou 20 tópicos, com um valor médio de pontuação de coerência entre os quatro meses de 0.674. Este valoré usado como uma métrica que calcula a concordância de um conjunto de pares e subconjunto de palavras e as probabilidades associadas em umúnico valor [31] . Em geral, os tópicos são interpretados como sendo coerentes se todos os termos, ou a maioria destes, são relacionados. A Figura 3 apresenta o gráfico da relação do número de tópicos com a pontuação de coerência.É possível notar que a pontuação de coerência tende a reduzir quando o número de tópicos seja superior a 20.\n",
            " A Figura 4 apresenta a distribuição do número de tópicos para cada mês. Nós observamos que existe certos tópicos que são mais populares. Ao analisarmos o tópico com maior número de postagens em cada mês, nós percebemos que esseé um tópico geral que agrupou termos relativosà própria doença.\n",
            " Reconhecimento de Entidades Mencionadas (REM)é definida como uma tarefa não-trivial de automaticamente identificar e classificar certas menções a entidades em um dado texto [21] . Por exemplo, na sentença \"Chá de alho cura coronavírus?\" postada por um dos usuáriosé possível identificar uma dúvida sobre o uso de tratamentos alternativos para a cura da COVID-19. Neste caso, apesar de chá de alho não ser um tipo de medicamento oficialmente reconhecido, o modelo REMé capaz de identificar que muitas pessoas consideram este tipo de chá como um medicamento para a COVID-19.\n",
            " Os métodos que lidam com a tarefa de reconhecer entidades mencionadas são baseados principalmente em modelos de aprendizagem de máquina [9, 33, 4] . A extração de entidades mencionadas no Twitteré uma tarefa ainda mais desafiadora [6] . Primeiro, as postagens no Twitter são curtas (máximo de 280 caracteres) e, portanto, são mais difíceis de se interpretar quando comparadas com textos mais longos. Segundo, os textos curtos apresentam muitas variações linguísticas e tendem a ser menos corretos em termos gramaticais. Porúltimo, a maioria das pesquisas sobre ferramentas de processamento de linguagem natural são voltadas para o idioma inglês [32] .\n",
            " Para esta tarefa, nós usamos a ferramenta spaCy [16] \n",
            " Nesta seção, nós discutimos a criação e a performance do modelo REM proposto e também a aplicação do modelo no conjunto de dados coletados. Para o modelo REM proposto, nós consideramos quatro entidades: Doença (DIS), Medicamento (DRUG), Organização (ORG) e Pessoa (PER). Para cada tipo de entidade mencionada, nós usamos as métricas de Precision (P), Recall (R) e F-Measure (F1). Precision corresponde ao percentual correto de menções a entidades, recall corresponde ao percentual do total de entidades que foram corretamente reconhecidas pelo modelo, enquanto F-Measure (F1)é a média harmônica entre precisão e revocação. Estas métricas são comumente utilizadas para avaliar a performance de modelos de REM [21, 18, 24, 11] .\n",
            " Com o objetivo de treinar o novo modelo, nós fizemos a anotação dos dados de treino. Para esta tarefa, nós usamos a ferramenta WebAnno [10] . A Figura 5 mostra uma captura de tela da ferramenta e alguns exemplos de anotações das entidades. [7] .\n",
            " Assim como ocorreu na aplicação do LDA para geração de tópicos, os termos representados como n-grams não apareceram destacados na nuvem de palavras.\n",
            " Nós iniciamos esta seção discutindo algumas limitações atribuídas a este estudo. Os dados foram obtidos através de um conjunto pré-definido de palavras-chaves. Portanto,é possível que alguns usuários tenham publicado mensagens sobre a pandemia de COVID-19 usando um conjunto de termos diferentes das palavras-chaves usadas na coleta e, consequentemente, estas mensagens não foram coletadas. Outra limitaçãoé que o Twitter não divulga dados sobre o perfil de seus usuários, tais como idade, sexo ou classe social. Assim, não foi possível realizar uma análise estratificada dos usuários e a amostragem analisada pode não representar toda a população brasileira. Além disso, uma limitaçãoé que focamos exclusivamente nos dados de redes sociais e, portanto, nossas conclusões não podem ser generalizáveis para outras plataformas de mídias sociais ou outros meios de comunicação, tais como TV ou rádio. Finalmente, apesar do Twitter ser uma plataforma bastante popular no Brasil, esta nãoé utilizada por toda a população. Assim, recomenda-se cautela antes de assumir a generalização dos resultados.\n",
            " A pandemia do COVID-19 vem ceifando a vida de milhões de pessoas no mundo. Atualmente, muitas pessoas fazem uso das mídias sociais como o Twitter para expressar diversos tipos de questionamentos sobre a doença. A compreensão das dúvidas comuns dos usuários dessas redes sociais pode ser um ponto de partida para projetar mensagens estratégicas para campanhas de saúde e estabelecer um sistema de comunicação eficaz durante a pandemia para um melhor enfrentamentoà doença.\n",
            " Como trabalhos futuros, nós pretendemos investigar a aplicação dos métodos desenvolvidos neste trabalho em outras fontes de mídias sociais, tais como, Instagram, Facebook e YouTube. Além disso, nós pretendemos estender o estudo para incluir dados de períodos mais longos, mesmo após o fim da pandemia. O objetivoé entender a manifestação das pessoas sobre o surto da doença.\n",

            " Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the intestinal nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. It is a chronic and asymptomatic parasite in most immunocompetent individuals. In immunocompromised patients, especially those undergoing corticotherapy, the disease can progress to advanced stages, such as hyperinfection syndrome and disseminated disease (1) . Corticosteroids are metabolized in the liver to chemical compounds structurally similar to ecdysone and are used by helminths for oviposition and larval ecdysis stimulation, promoting an accelerated autoinfection cycle (2) .\n",
            " The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic remains a health challenge for society worldwide. The advancing knowledge of the physiopathology suggests that a rapid replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to an exacerbated immune response involving many cytokines (cytokine storm), triggering a severe inflammatory response in the lungs. Using corticosteroids and anticoagulants in such cases has produced beneficial results (3) (4) (5) , with dexamethasone and methylprednisolone being used most frequently (6) (7) .\n",
            " The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on S. stercoralis infection remains to be elucidated. However, there are few reports of severe strongyloidiasis in patients with COVID-19 after undergoing treatment with corticosteroids (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) ; currently, only six cases of coinfection with S. stercoralis and COVID-19 have been reported ( Figure 1 ). Clinical data of these patients are incipient or partial; however, generally, the majority of the reported cases tended to be in male individuals (66.7%), with an average age of 61.3 years. These individuals were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment, were released from the hospital, and returned after 22.8 days on average with skin signs and symptoms, such as dermatitis, followed by respiratory and intestinal manifestations. The diagnosis of S. stercoralis infection was confirmed by parasitic stool examination in one case (16.7%), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in two (33.3%), microscopic stool and serological methods in two (33.3%), and microscopic sputum in one (16.7%).\n",
            " Different therapeutic regimens ( Figure 1 ) were used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection with methylprednisolone and dexamethasone. In parallel with corticosteroids, antiviral drugs were also used. For S. stercoralis infection, ivermectin was used in 50% of the patients, albendazole in 16.7%, and the combination of both in 33.3%. All patients survived COVID-19 and strongyloidiasis. It is important to highlight that 83.3% of the described cases occurred in non-endemic areas (1,13) for S. stercoralis infection, possibly indicating a link to immigration flows.\n",
            " Oliveira (6) reported the importance of the identification of S. stercoralis infection using diagnostic methods for parasite detection, especially cultures, or even serological screening. Once the helminth parasite is detected, anti-helminthic treatment is recommended before corticosteroid therapy is administered. De Wilton et al. (5) proposed an algorithm for screening the risk of S. stercoralis exposure in patients samples with COVID-19 at a hospital in England. In general, all patients who had travelled or immigrated from endemic areas and those with a high risk of S. stercoralis infection underwent a diagnostic test and treatment with ivermectin. Although England is not considered an endemic area for S. stercoralis infection, there is a concern about the development of severe forms of this parasitosis when associated with corticosteroid therapy, especially in immigrants.\n",
            " Unlike in the countries that reported cases of coinfection, the reality of strongyloidiasis in Brazil is distinct, with an estimated occurrence varying between 5.5% and 20% based on the microscopic parasitic examination of stool. When other diagnostic methods are analyzed, these numbers may be significantly higher since directly detecting larval forms is not needed (13, 14) . Pandemic situations, such as COVID-19, bring awareness to the scientific community worldwide to the need for studies on other non-viral infectious agents for the prevention of fatal consequences of possible associations. In this scenario, the possibility of asymptomatic infection by S. stercoralis becoming symptomatic and severe with the use of corticosteroids is evident. There is a need to apply and to implement more sensitive and specific diagnostic techniques for strongyloidiasis that could be used in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals (5, 6) . The public health systems need to consider the construction and validation of a diagnostic protocol. Many diagnostic methods have been reported in the literature (15) based on the direct detection of the parasite by agar plate culture or molecular methods, or even the indirect detection of antibodies, antigens, or immune complexes; however, none of these methods are available in the Brazilian national health system, only for research. Therefore, strongyloidiasis continues to be considered one of the most neglected parasitic diseases worldwide. The rapid identification of positive cases could minimize the occurrence of severe cases resulting from coinfection; in Brazil, this would demonstrate the real situation of the condition in the country since it has high incidence rates of this important parasitosis.\n"

            " I was in my first week as a newly graduated doctor when I encountered a vaccine-skeptic -a patient who was convinced vaccines were dangerous and could weaken the human race. I remember thinking -as a doctor, I am supposed to take a detailed history, but I hope you forgive me if I switch off just for a little bit, because right now isn't the time for this debate. You learn something at medical school and immediately try to tell people about it, but you can't convince them -not easily anyway. Especially if you have been indoctrinated with factual information along the lines of this 2 : an estimated 1.5 million children die each year-one every 20 seconds-from vaccine-preventable diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia.\n",
            " When I was thirteen, I had my first experience of outcomes that such beliefs can lead to -one of my best friends, a would-be star track-athlete developed polio -when we were all lined up at school and given these bitter tasting drops (with a spoonful of sugar), Samuel had missed out as his parents had refused vaccinations for him. When you are thirteen, you couldn't care less one way or the other -parents tell you what to do and you listen -most of the time, anyway. Then you get older and start making your own decisions.\n",
            " But unbelief in the concept or power of vaccinations had its own dangers. Samuel always seemed to be faster and stronger than us, until polio took effect -then he could barely walk. Maybe this was something his parents were not expecting. They finally had proof, but they perhaps couldn't tell it to anyone, because of the people they were -there was a need to make spiritual sense of their son's disability -and resolve a conflict with their religious faith, that had led them to believe that God wouldn't have given Samuel the talent at sport if he wasn't going to use it.\n",
            " Even where I live, in New Zealand, a few people I know are strongly against all forms of vaccinations. And, they are all not Internet wackos. In fact shoddiness at some historical points of vaccine research is partly to blame. Samuel's parents refused to allow his being vaccinated, as they were staunch Jehovah's witnesses. But the history of vaccination has had a few manufacturing missteps.\n",
            " I remember my father telling me about polio and its dangers. 1952 was the year he entered medical school. In that year, the American polio epidemic was the worst outbreak in the nation's history, he said. Of nearly 58,000 cases reported that year, over 3000 people died, and over 20,000 were left with mild to disabling paralysis. A few years earlier, Jonas Salk, an American doctor and virologist had accepted an appointment to the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Salk felt that medicine owed a moral commitment to society to provide immunization from communicable diseases. He ended up making the world's first polio vaccine.\n",
            " In an interview with the New York Times, Salk merely viewed himself as a 'highly evolved mutant' -one that could tap into the prevailing current of evolution and speed it along. He felt this was his guiding force:\n",
            " There is a dynamism, a dynamic force that propels us into the future, … I have come to recognize evolution not only as an active process that I am experiencing all the time but as something I can guide by the choices I make, by the experiments I design,\" he said. \"I have always sensed this as the next evolutionary step. It's not something of which a great many are capable, but some are… That is the source of my guidance 3 3 George Johnson, Once Again, A MAN WITH A MISSION. 25, Nov, 1990. New York Times magazine. http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/25/magazine/once-again-a-manwith-a-mission.html?pagewanted=all accessed Dec 25, 2015.\n",
            " On April 12, 1955 , Jonas Salk's polio vaccine -made by inactivating poliovirus with formaldehyde-was declared to be safe and effective. The three-pronged trial of Salk's vaccine had included 1.8 million children who were inoculated with either vaccine (made by either Eli Lilly or Parke-Davis) or placebo or were not inoculated (but only observed). Given the scale of the epidemic, the Laboratory of Biologics Control rapidly granted licenses to produce the vaccine to five pharmaceutical companies: Eli Lilly, Parke-Davis, Wyeth, Pitman-Moore, and Cutter.\n",
            " The granting of the licenses took only 2 hours; however, 2 weeks later, the Director of the Laboratory of Biologics Control, William Workman, was informed that five children in California, all first-and second-graders, had become paralyzed after receiving polio vaccine. In each instance, Cutter Labs had manufactured the vaccine.\n",
            " Paul Offit, who has chronicled this sad saga, views the Cutter Incident as a turning point in vaccine manufacturing. On one hand, we had a terrified nation, desperately seeking someone to kill a dangerous beast lurking within its midst. Then Big Pharma arrived, boots, white-coats and all, to reduce the critter to a clump of smoking red coals. Once the flames receded, people were crying, not able to understand how these medical industrial misadventures work -to keep the spirit of pharmaceutical progress alive, a few lives are often sacrificed.\n",
            " The Cutter Incident led to a landmark court case in California, Gottsdanker v. Cutter Laboratories, that I remember studying when I studied Medical Law at the University of Glasgow. Because the Salk vaccine was rushed through, none of the laboratories manufacturing the vaccine had experience in mass production of such a vaccine -and all had difficulty completely inactivating the poliovirus. Therefore, while Cutter was technically not negligent, damages were nevertheless awarded for 'implied warranty. ' However the Cutter case led to pharmaceutical companies' reluctance to embark on ambitious vaccine projects -in 2004 only four big companies were producing vaccines globally, and two of them had severely reduced their vaccine research programs. Vaccine shortages are increasingly becoming common -the most recent and most widely known is the influenza vaccine shortage that created a public health crisis. Truth be told, shortages are not unknown for vaccines against tetanus, pneumococcal pneumonia, and other childhood diseases.\n",
            " In actual fact, the vaccine for polio we had at school (that Samuel missed out on) was the oral Sabin vaccine, developed after the Salk vaccine, which was an injectable version. *** Francis Darwin once wrote 4 :\n",
            " But in science the credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not to the man to whom the idea first occurs. Not the man who finds a grain of new and precious quality but to him who sows it, reaps it, grinds it and feeds the world on it.\n",
            " So it was with smallpox vaccination. Edward Jenner is widely credited with discovering a vaccine for smallpox, even though the disease itself was known from ancient times -the mummified head of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses V (died 1156 BC) bears evidence of smallpox. 5 In fact, the word smallpox derives from the term small pockes (pocke meaning sac), and was first used in England at the end of the fifteenth century to distinguish the disease from syphilis, which was then known as the great pockes. 6 In fact, smallpox had been reported in ancient Asian cultures -smallpox was described as early as 1122 BC in China and is mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts of India. Even the practice of vaccination was actually introduced from Asia to Europe in the eighteenth century.\n",
            " Before the formal process of vaccination was adopted, inoculation was the method to combat such infectious diseases -the inoculator usually used a lancet or needle and obtained pus or material from a ripe pustule of someone suffering from smallpox. This material was then introduced on the arms or legs of the non-immune person, thereby triggering an immune response. This was where Jenner made massive advances -with experiments using cowpox 'pus' on those infected with smallpox. In those days, in the eighteenth century, it was common knowledge amongst farm folk that those afflicted by cowpox never ended up with smallpox. It was reported that Jenner overheard a dairymaid say 7 : \"I shall never have smallpox for I have had cowpox. I shall never have an ugly pockmarked face.\" This lead to Jenner formally testing his theory -Jenner showed that cowpox not only protected against smallpox but also could be transmitted from one person to another as a deliberate mechanism of protection. In spite of being acknowledged worldwide for his work in the field of public vaccination, Jenner remained a humble, interesting and altruistic character. He built a one-room hut in his garden, which he called the 'Temple of Vaccinia' -where he vaccinated the poor for free. 4 Francis Darwin. First Galton Lecture before the Eugenics Society', Eugenics Review, 1914, volume 6, page 9. Smallpox eventually became the first disease for which mass vaccination was practiced, and appropriately it was the first disease to be eradicated globally in 1979.\n",
            " At a basic level, vaccinations using 'live' agents induce immunity via one of the following methods -using a related virus from another animal, unnatural route, or unnatural cell type.\n",
            " A related virus from another animal was the method used by Edward Jenner. The principles of 'Jennerian' vaccines was to make vaccines using infective agents that either do not cause disease or cause mild disease in humans, or for any animal being vaccinated. Jenner used cowpox against smallpox; in later years, using the same principle, BCG vaccine was made from Mycobacterium bovis -the agent that causes tuberculosis in cattle, to protect against human tuberculosis.\n",
            " The principle of using an unnatural route hinges on the fact that viruses are known to be less potent if introduced via an unnatural bodily routethis was the technique used when military recruits in the 1970s were vaccinated against the adenovirus that causes Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This virus was potent and pathogenic in the respiratory system of humans, but when given via the gastrointestinal system (as enteric-coated tablets) they replicated without causing disease, thereby inducing immunity.\n",
            " While Jenner showed that inoculating people with cowpox pus could prevent against smallpox, he did not understand or explain how the human immune system developed this protection. It was Louis Pasteur, the French microbiologist, who went a long way in explaining this. Unlike Jenner, Pasteur used inactivated vaccines. In the late 1800s, Pasteur experimented with the killed Rabies virus (that he derived from dried rabbit spinal cords) that he used to prevent disease in animals, and later humans. Remember Jonas Salk whom we discussed earlier? Salk essentially used the Pasteur technique -he grew poliovirus in a culture, then purified it and then inactivated it using formaldehyde -and then used it in an injectable form against polio.\n",
            " The other method of creating live vaccines is to make the virus inactive by serial passage through unnatural or artificial cell types -for example one measles vaccine was made by passing it 24 times through human kidney lines, 28 times in human amniotic cells, 6 times in a chick embryo and 85 times in chicken fibroblasts. The idea in such cases is to create viral 'mutants' that are best suited to growing in such artificial media, but less dangerous when returned to the original host. Now that genomes have been sequenced and DNA technology is everywhere, it is possible to deliberately induce such mutations in human cells and this is where vaccine technology seems to be heading.\n",
            " The problem with killed vaccines is that they don't last long; the problem with live vaccines is that they can be unstable and also interfere with each other; the problem with human beings is that they are fickle, and immune systems can be variably deficient or unpredictable. *** We were not a hugging people. In terms of emotional comfort it was our belief that no amount of physical contact could match the healing powers of a well made cocktail. ~ David Sedaris 8\n",
            " It is difficult to imagine the history or sociology of Western society without alcohol -Scotch Whiskey, Irish Guinness, Rum from the Caribbean and American attempts at prohibition are all part of our collective consciousness. Louis Pasteur's name is irrevocably linked to both alcohol and vaccines. He was the first to conclude that fermentation is a vital (as in living) process, and he defined it as \"respiration without air.\" The story goes that in the 1850s, a brewer named Bigo contacted Pasteur because he was having problems producing alcohol from beetroot fermentation. His containers were producing sour milk-like liquids instead of alcohol, and he sought help from Pasteur, as he was considered an expert in fermentation. When Pasteur examined the containers, he could detect large amounts of yeast from the vats containing alcohol, but in containers containing the abnormal samples there were cells much smaller than yeast. Pasteur concluded that there are two types of fermentation: caused by alcohol or lactic acid. Alcoholic fermentation occurs by the action of yeast; lactic acid fermentation by the action of bacteria.\n",
            " Pasteur's findings had huge implications for the alcohol industry and Pasteur even patented his own beer-making equipment. Today alcohol is a huge industry. In America, where booze was once banned, Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey production resulted in $2.2 billion worth of revenue in 2012, according to a recent report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Most yeast strains can tolerate an alcohol concentration of 10-15 % before being killed. This is why the percentage of alcohol in wines is typically in this concentration range. For beverages with higher concentrations of alcohol the fermented products must be distilled, as is done with whiskey and other spirits (Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky; there is even a Bourbon law -'Federal Standards of Identity' for Bourbon the law stipulates that for a whiskey to call itself bourbon, its mash, the mixture of grains from which the product is distilled, must contain at least 51 % corn, and there are specifications about how this must be distilled).\n",
            " However, like human beings, yeasts also have different tolerance levels for alcohol. Therefore, brewers and wine makers have to select different strains of yeast to produce different alcohol contents in their fermented beverages.\n",
            " Yeast has uses in the vaccine industry other than the well-known uses in bread-making and brewing. If the previous generation of vaccines were using intermediate organisms or unnatural cell types to weaken the disease-causing pathogen, newer vaccine technology using recombinant DNA has found yeast as useful as brewers did. A small piece of DNA is taken from the virus or bacterium that we want to protect against. This is then inserted into the DNA of yeast cells. These yeast cells are then able to produce proteins from the virus, and this is purified and used as the active ingredient -this was method used to produce the vaccine against Human Papillomavirus that is implicated in certain types of genital warts and cervical cancer. Therefore, if the previous ideology behind vaccines was to prevent infectious diseases, we are now looking at 'vaccines' against cancers and non-communicable conditions. The paradigm has shifted from population health to more personalized medicine in the future where high-risk individuals may receive individualized vaccines. Of course, with such measures comes an invariable increase in cost and less democratization. *** Jones and Bartlett, writing about the AIDS Epidemic, loves to quote TIME magazine in 1981 9 : \"(Genetic engineering) … the most powerful and awesome skill acquired by man since the splitting of the atom.\" But microbiology in particular has always been the forefront of evolution, as the Earth is littered with many different creatures. Unencumbered by size, viruses and bacteria, these little microscopic meddlers keep morphing into new forms and view us merely as companions and co-inhabitors, and not as superiors. Scientists by nature do not make people immediately suspicious that something is out of control, as they wait to study the evidence. The AIDS Epidemic is worth studying to see the response of modern science to ancient evolution. Everyone now generally agrees that SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) crossed over to man from monkey in the 1940s or 1950s, and this led to new strains of viruses that became HIV. It was evolution at its finest, these viruses had acquired a new fullness, a savageryand what really mattered was if humans, in response would do the same, even with the advantage of scientific shortcuts.\n",
            " In June 1981, 2 years before I was a freshman at medical school, the CDC wrote in its MMWR (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report) about five 9 The AIDS Epidemic. Jones & Bartlett Learning; 7 edition (February 22, 2013).\n",
            " Californian gay men suffering from Pneumocystis pneumonia. These men had deficient T-cell immunity. In July 1981, there was another MMWR report describing Kaposi's sarcoma in gay men. These were relatively rare diseases surfacing due to immunodeficiency. Because the disease was only (at this stage) reported in gay men, doctors postulated possible causes based on known gay behavior (could amyl nitrate, a drug used by gay men cause this?) rather than recognizing this for what is was -a new transmissible virus. By early 1983, when I entered medical school, the disease had been reported in 16 countries, more than 1000 Americans were afflicted, and mother-to-child transmission and heterosexual infection had also been reported.\n",
            " For the first three years of the AIDS Epidemic, the number of cases 'only' doubled every 6 months, almost as quickly as a new theory of its origins was hypothesized -all increasingly religious, conspiratorial, moral or microbiologic. It was in 1986 that the HIV virus finally got its name.\n",
            " In the 1980s, Max Essex of the Harvard Public Health School recovered a virus in African Green Monkeys that was biochemically very similar to HIV. This virus was SIV. Essex's team theorized that perhaps the SIV had crossed over into humans via a monkey-bite. About a decade later, Vanessa Hirsh of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases found a strain of SIV almost identical to that of HIV from Sooty Mangabey monkeys in West Africa. What both these researchers discovered was that like humans, viruses are extremely adept at evolutionary experimentation. More recently, in 2010, Preston Marx reported that SIV was prevalent in as many as 40 species of African monkeys for 32,000 years. Evolution is an ancient discipline; human memory and attention is short-lived -this reality is what makes the world perilous for us. In some ways as Laurie Garrett points out in 'The Coming Plague' 10 -we were fortunate with AIDS in that it gave us easy clues that a new organism had emerged: AIDS caused atypical infections (Pneumocystis) or cancers (Kaposi's) rather than the infections found in regular folk; it was first noted in gay men; it was first noted in the USA, a first world country with a highly developed disease control system, and further, scientists had just developed the ability to study retroviruses.\n",
            " Yet, 30 years later, the Ebola Epidemic was allowed to get out of control for precisely the same reasons -but Ebola is different, vastly more aggressive -AIDS has a long latency period of nearly a decade while Ebola's latency is under a month -yet there was lack of funding as this was seen as an African virus. By mid-March 2015, the current Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone had reported over 24,000 cases, and close to 10,000 deaths including around 500 healthcare workers -causing Dr. Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank, to warn participants at the 2015 World Economic Forum 11 : \"The world is dangerously unprepared for future deadly pandemics like the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\"\n",
            " The Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) organization, whose doctors and nurses do selfless and amazing work in many troubled countries could not hide its frustration, calling the international response \"slow, derisory and irresponsible\" 12 adding, \"Dead bodies in the street, families wiped out, dozens of health care workers infected, hospitals shut down and panic and mistrust in the eyes of the people in the streets.\" Hardly an encouraging picture, as this is unlikely to be the last epidemic the world or us humans shall face. The poor initial response to Ebola will have repercussions for all, not least of all the loss of medical experts in a continent where they are needed. As George Dvorsky noted in an article regarding the Ebola Epidemic 13 :\n",
            " The effects (of Ebola) will be felt for years to come. The loss of so many medical personnel is expected to have downstream effects on the health system of affected West African countries, including a sharp rise in maternal mortality to the tune of an additional 4,022 deaths each year for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the ability of healthcare workers to deal with other major diseases, like Malaria and Lassa (another hemorrhagic fever), was severely curtailed during the epidemic.\n",
            " And, finally after plenty of handwringing and political maneuvering, an effective Ebola vaccine was made. The vesicular stomatitis virus (one that causes mouth ulcers and is relatively harmless) was genetically altered -a gene for its native envelope glycoprotein was replaced with that from an Ebola virus strain (Zaire, Kikwit 1995). This vaccine had been developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and it had been patented as early as 2003, even though adequate human trials were not available until recently. Phase III (final stages of efficacy and safety) trials were undertaken in Guinea using 'ring vaccination' -an almost biblical process that involves identifying an infected person, their contacts, and their contacts' contacts and vaccinating them. The vaccine proved 100 % effective -and scientists hailed this as a potential game-changer. The early results, published in The Lancet, showed the vaccine had 100 % effectiveness when given immediately. However, there were 16 cases of Ebola in those that were (in the study) a part of the delayed vaccination group (0.5 %).\n",
            " The panic when a new virus emerges out of Africa is surprising. After all, the same chemistry and DNA lies within the cellular frames of most creatures. The density or color of our blood, the patterns of our vertebral systems, the unreliability of our nerves may vary -but there is a certain commonality. When primitive humans left Africa about 100,000 years ago, our ancestral diets and behaviors did not matter, as they were but a speck on the surface of the Earth. Now we have, within a short space of time overpopulated, polluted and destroyed our environment to the degree that of all organisms to emerge out of Africa, Homo sapiens may indeed be the most dangerous of all. The Earth may be our hermitage -and nature's world may be wonderfully brilliant to behold -but nature is essentially non-discriminatory to color, friends, angels, parents, books or stories -ultimately, only the fingerprints of evolutionary processes matter. Therein lies the problem with industrializing immunity.\n",
            " You see, there is fundamentally a problem with trying to create artificial immunity, as if we can gratify evolution or satisfy its needs. The problem with evolution and Natural Selection was that the process remained aloof from individual needs, solitary cries or quick satisfaction -all things that the vaccination industry seeks to now commercialize. Can intimacy between human and viral DNA end up being dangerous? This was the problem Penn State University Professor, Andrew Read pondered over. In 2001, Read proposed that \"leaky\" vaccines -ones that allow transmission of disease to organisms -might prompt the evolution of more dangerous strains of organisms. Read, an evolutionary biologist stumbled upon experimental evidence that vaccines can alter evolution -organisms we are trying to protect against ending up creating more virulent forms.\n",
            " In 2001, Read published a paper in Nature, using mathematical modeling to predict that vaccination could alter evolution of viruses. But he lacked experimental evidence; until more recently. Read is cautious about the risks in the future from scientists engineering Ebola vaccines. Could vaccines make viruses evolve to more virulent forms? After all, it would be typically human and arrogantly presumptuous of us to assume we are the only ones evolving. We may be trying to create artificial men, but other creatures are happy enough to let their destiny be determined by nature's own devices.\n",
            " Read began examining a virus that causes something called Marek's disease in chickens. In a series of experiments, Read looked at different strains of the Marek's virus. The older, milder strains kill about half of the unvaccinated birds in a couple of months, but the newer \"hot\" strains kill 100 % of infected chickens in 10 days -in other words all unvaccinated birds had no chance of survival. What caused this increase in virulence? Vaccines? To test this theory, he began looking at the population 'fitness' of these organisms -essentially evolutionary 'fitness' is determined by how good a virus is in replicating in different environments. What Read's experiments showed was this -the newer, more deadly or \"hot\" strains were 'not very fit' in unvaccinated birds -in other words if there were no vaccines against Marek's disease, these increasingly virulent forms would die away -the hot strains would burn themselves out by killing their hosts before they had transmitted the infection to other birds. But now, given the hot strain has been rendered fitter by the vaccine, vaccinated birds survive longer and thereby shed more virus -and thereby continue to transmit disease.\n",
            " Read's ideas may be controversial, if only for the fact that his science is sometimes quoted by the anti-vaccine movement. But his experimental methods are sound and stack up scientifically. This year, his team's research and findings were published in the influential journal, PLOS Biology. 14 Humans are increasingly full of manufactured parts, working valves and artificially enhanced intelligence, but at our core we are biological and biochemical beings. After all, as the American Society of Human Genetics noted, humans share over 90 % of their DNA with their primate cousins. 15 As we sleep, evolution is busy at work tinkering with little enzymes, proteins and genetic code; every time we wake, tiny invisible creatures have become wholer, fitter and more improved. And, as far as nature or our planet are concerned, there is no need to specifically guard or protect the human race -from their point of view such wasted energy is corny and has but the symbolism of a statue. And all statues shall eventually crumble.\n",

            " The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic and associated public health measures aiming to limit its transmission have had an unprecedented impact on healthcare services at all levels, including on routine childhood immunizations [1] [2] [3] . Multiple jurisdictions worldwide have reported significant declines in childhood vaccines administered and immunization coverage in the months following the pandemic declaration [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Disruptions to routine childhood immunization services leading to decreased coverage are concerning for possible resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), including measles [15] [16] [17] .\n",
            " In response to these concerns, international and Canadian public health and governmental institutions have recommended that routine immunizations are essential health services that should not be deferred, especially the primary series and booster doses for children aged less than two years [18] [19] [20] . Some studies have nonetheless reported on parents avoiding medical care facilities, clinics not providing in-person services due to the perceived risk of COVID-19 transmission, and school immunization programs being suspended [21, 22] . There is currently limited data to quantify the impact of the pandemic on pediatric immunization coverage in Canada, and whether the pandemic has impacted access to vaccination differentially for specific groups of children. The objective of this study was to compare the immunization coverage for children under two years old before and during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic by using primary care electronic medical records (EMR) data in the province of Ontario.\n",
            " We conducted an observational retrospective open cohort study using EMR data from family medicine practices included in the University of Toronto Practice-Based Research Network (UTOPIAN) to assess immunization coverage from January 2019 to December 2020.\n",
            " We used data from the UTOPIAN Data Safe Haven, which is a secure research database comprised of de-identified patient records extracted from EMRs of contributing family medicine practices associated with the University of Toronto, with more than 70% of these family physicians practicing in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in Ontario [23] . From the UTOPIAN database, we extracted the sociodemographic characteristics (date of birth, sex and postal code) and immunization records (name of vaccine and date given) of the children included in the study population. Measures of socioeconomic status (SES) and marginalization based on neighborhood income, material deprivation and ethnic concentration quintiles were derived based on the children's postal code using the Statistics Canada Postal Code Conversion File [24] [25] [26] .\n",
            " We created an open cohort of children using the following eligibility criteria: 1) were aged 0-2 years old during the study period, 2) had a valid sex and date of birth recorded in their EMR, 3) had at least two visits recorded in their EMR during the study period, with at least one visit after the second week of life to ensure continuity of care.\n",
            " Ontario is Canada's most populous province, with nearly 40% of the country's population [27] .\n",
            " Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Ontario declared a state of emergency on March 17, 2020 and entered its first \"lockdown\" [28] . As the first wave of the pandemic improved, restrictions were progressively lifted throughout the province with Toronto being one of the last regions to enter the final stage of reopening on July 31, 2020 [29] . Ontario experienced a second wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths from September 2020 to February 2021 [30] . At the end of the study period, Ontario had experienced the second highest number of COVID-19 cases and number of deaths in Canada [31] . Within the province, 30% of all cases have been detected in Toronto and the GTA [30] .\n",
            " In Ontario, immunizations for children under two years old are usually administered by primary care providers, including family physicians, during regular well-baby visits [22, 32] and documented in the children's medical record. EMR data from family physicians' clinics has been previously used and validated to study childhood immunization coverage in Ontario [32] [33] [34] .\n",
            " Ontario's Publicly Funded Immunization Schedule [35] recommends six different vaccines in the first 24 months of life (Table 1) [36] .\n",
            " Our study had two primary outcome measures: up-to-date (UTD) immunization coverage and ontime immunization coverage. UTD immunization refers to receiving all recommended vaccines by a certain age or by a specific point in time [37, 38] . On-time immunization refers to receiving the recommended vaccines for a specific age milestone within a 30-day leeway period after the due date [37, 38] . For example, a 12-month-old child should receive PCV13, Men-C-C and MMR vaccines within 30 days after the recommended age to be considered on-time and should have received all doses of recommended vaccines since birth to be considered UTD (Table 1 ).\n",
            " The study population's sociodemographic characteristics were summarized using frequencies and We calculated weekly (Sunday to Saturday) coverage rates from January 6, 2019 to December 20, 2020, which were the start of the first and last full weeks in 2019 and 2020 respectively. We used linear regression models to compare the average immunization coverage rates over three periods of time: baseline/pre-pandemic period, from January 6, 2019 to March 14, 2020 (T1); early pandemic period during the first wave/lockdown in Ontario, from March 15 to August 1, 2020 (T2); and later pandemic period during the reopening phase after first wave and beginning of second wave, from August 2 to December 26, 2020 (T3). We also examined if the differences in on-time immunization coverage rates over the three time periods were associated with any sociodemographic characteristics by fitting adjusted regression models. Each of these models included time period (to calculate the adjusted difference in immunization rates between time periods), one sociodemographic characteristic (to calculate the baseline difference in immunization rates for each level of the characteristic) and the interaction between time period and the sociodemographic characteristic (to calculate difference in differences). We also computed likelihood ratio statistics to assess the contribution of the interaction term to the regression model.\n",

            " A total of 12,313 children aged 0 to 2 years old were included in our study population. The majority of children lived in an urban region (87.2%) and in a neighborhood of the most ethnically diverse quintile (33.4%). They were otherwise almost equally distributed across birth year, sex, neighborhood income and material deprivation quintiles (Table 2) . They had a median of 9 (interquartile range: 6-13) visits with their family physician during the study period, which corresponds to the number of recommended routine care visits for young children [39] . \n",
            " The baseline T1 average on-time immunization coverage rates were the highest for younger \n",
            " In this retrospective study using EMR data from a network of family medicine clinics in the GTA, Ontario, we found that routine childhood immunization coverage rates in children under 2 years old decreased significantly in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in children aged 15 and 18-months old. The coverage rates recovered in the second half of 2020 but remained lower overall compared to pre-pandemic rates. Our study provides more insight on which groups of children should be prioritized for immunization catch-up strategies and for targeted interventions to prevent immunization delays in future pandemic waves or other events that could be disruptive to the primary immunization schedule.\n",
            " Similar to reports from other countries, we found that the impact of the pandemic and stay-at-home orders on immunization coverage rates was the most significant in the early period of the pandemic and only partially recovered subsequently [9-11, 14, 40] . Some of this recovery may have been prompted by public messaging from official organizations that routine childhood immunization is an essential health service [9, 10] . In May 2020, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended prioritizing primary immunization series up to 18-months old during the pandemic [20] , which may have encouraged the increase in coverage rates seen in our results starting in June 2020. However, given lower rates persisted until the end of our observation period in December 2020, more education and support should be put forward for healthcare providers and parents [21] .\n",
            " Our finding that older (15-and 18-month-old) children have experienced a more significant drop in immunization coverage than younger children in the early pandemic period has been noted in other parts of the world [9] [10] [11] . Our study also found that the baseline on-time immunization coverage rate fell from around 88% for 2-month-old children to 51% at 18-months old. A similar trend was reported in the United States where the baseline vaccination coverage rate decreased from around 90% for 1-month-old children to 70% at 16-months old [11] . As children age, it is possible that there are more delays in attending routine visits as parents go back to working fulltime [41] . Additionally, there may be less perceived infectious risks for older children, especially if staying home during lockdown, which may explain why we found that the varicella vaccine The MMR vaccine coverage is an often-studied outcome as measles is a highly transmissible VPD.\n",
            " Substantial drops in MMR vaccine coverage and administration in children have been observed in the early pandemic period in several countries [10, 11, 42] . In our study, we found that MMR vaccine UTD coverage for children under two dropped only by 1.7% in the early pandemic period and remained at the same reduced level during the rest of 2020. However, even small (2-5%) reductions in measles vaccination coverage have been projected to result in exponential increase in measles outbreak size [43] . Close monitoring of new cases of measles and other VPDs will therefore be important as lockdown measures and travel restrictions are lifted due to the potential risk of imported cases.\n",
            " In the United States, vaccine administrations plummeted across all racial and ethnic groups during the initial lockdown period, but recovery was lower in non-Hispanic Black children than in other groups during the reopening period [11] . In our study, we did not have patient-level ethnicity information, but we stratified our analyses by neighborhood ethnic concentration quintiles, in addition to income and material deprivation quintiles. Although the decrease in on-time coverage rates during the pandemic was found to be similar across all socioeconomic subgroups in our study, there was a significant difference in the baseline on-time coverage rates, with children from the lowest income, the most materially deprived and the most ethnically diverse quintiles having the lowest immunization coverage rates. These neighborhood quintiles have been associated with higher levels of marginalization and to health inequities in other studies [25] . Public health interventions and catch-up immunization programs should be preferentially implemented in these low income and ethnically diverse neighborhoods to provide equitable access to immunization services and improve coverage gaps [44, 45] .\n",
            " As COVID-19 number of cases and deaths continued to surge in subsequent waves and as vaccines against COVID-19 have been rolled out in Ontario in 2021, further studies are needed to trend the impact on childhood immunization coverage rates during 2021. Additional studies are also needed to better understand immunization coverage discrepancies between certain neighborhoods and potential association with other individual-, family-and health system-level factors, and to quantify the impact of the pandemic on other immunizations, such as school-based immunization programs.\n",
            " The UTOPIAN data is limited to patients living mostly in the GTA, where there was a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, so our results may not be generalizable to other settings with lower COVID-19 incidence. Additionally, the patients in our study had access to family physicians working in clinical practices affiliated with the University of Toronto that likely had access to personal protective equipment and remained open to in-person appointments during the pandemic.\n",
            " Our results may therefore not be generalizable to children with limited access to primary care/family physicians, as these children may have experienced additional barriers to immunization services during the pandemic. The use of EMR data may lead to children being misclassified as not up-to-date or on-time in their immunizations if children received vaccines outside of their primary care practices or if their records are not adequately updated, which may have limited our analyses and led to an under-estimation of immunization coverage. However, primary care EMR data has been evaluated and shown to be a reliable source for childhood immunization coverage analyses in Ontario [33, 34, 38] as immunization services are mainly given in primary care clinics for infants and pre-school children. We still aimed to mitigate the possible impact of missing immunization records by only including patients with at least two visits with UTOPIAN family physicians to ensure continuity of care and exclude children who only saw the UTOPIAN-contributing family physician once (eg. walk-in visit, newborn visit, etc.) and\n",
            " completed their well-baby visits elsewhere.\n",
            " Our study found that childhood immunization coverage rates for children under 2 in Ontario, Canada were significantly decreased during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic and only partially recovered during the rest of 2020. Implementation of public health and primary care interventions for providers and parents are needed to ensure adequate catch-up of delayed/missed immunizations to prevent potential outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases as these children enter daycare/kindergarten, especially in certain age and socioeconomic groups where baseline immunization coverage gaps have been identified.\n",

The assay was conducted in accordance with Battelle laboratory protocols and qualified critical reagents (Columbus, Ohio, TAK919/mRNA-1273 manuscript Vaccine 8 USA). The 50% MN titre (MN 50 ) was reported for each sample. While the assays were qualified in the previous study [9] , both bAb and nAb assays were fully validated at initiation for this study.\n",
            " In the present study, the primary safety outcome measures were: solicited AEs through 7 days after each vaccination; unsolicited AEs through 28 days after each vaccination; MAAEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of vaccination and AEs leading to participant withdrawal from the trial through day 57; and proportion of participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection through day 57.\n",
            " The primary immunogenicity outcome measure was serum bAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 on day 57. The key secondary immunogenicity outcome measures were serum bAb levels and serum nAb titres against SARS-CoV-2 throughout the follow-up period (except for serum bAb level on day 57, which was the primary outcome measure). Only data to day 57 are available to date.\n",
            " The trial planned to enrol 200 participants, 150 in the mRNA-1273 arm and 50 in the placebo arm. No formal statistical power calculations were performed to determine the sample size. The sample size for the trial was considered sufficient with a 95% probability of observing at least one AE with a 2% event rate in the mRNA-1273 arm. The interim analysis was performed for safety and immunogenicity after all participants had completed the day 57 visit (data cut-off date: 31 March 2021). The full analysis set (FAS) and safety analysis set (SAS) each included all randomised participants who received at least one treatment dose, and the per protocol set (PPS) included participants in the FAS who received two treatment doses, had evaluable TAK919/mRNA-1273 manuscript Vaccine immunogenicity data and had no significant protocol deviations. All safety summaries were presented by treatment group based on the SAS, and unsolicited AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities dictionary version 24.0. For the immunogenicity endpoints, geometric mean titre (GMT), geometric mean fold rises (GMFR), and seroconversion rate (SCR; defined as percentage of participants with a change from below the lower limit of quantification [LLOQ, 1.0 AU/mL for bAb and 159.79 for nAb] to equal to or above LLOQ, or a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline), and their respective 95% CIs were analysed in the PPS. Antibody values reported as below LLOQ were replaced by 0.5 × LLOQ. Values that were greater than the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ; 2052 AU/mL for bAb and 11173.11 for nAb) were replaced by the ULOQ. Sub-analyses by age groups (≥20 years to <65 years or ≥65 years) and sex (male or female) were performed for solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs and immunogenicity analyses. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4.\n",
            " A total of 319 participants were screened between 21 January 2021 and 3 February 2021 and 200 participants were randomised (150 participants in the mRNA-1273 arm and 50 participants in the placebo arm; Figure 2 ). In the mRNA-1273 arm, 147/150 (98.0%) participants received both doses of vaccine. Three participants (2.0%) did not receive a second vaccination in the mRNA-1273 arm due to adverse events (injection-site rash in two participants; injection-site pain, fatigue, arthralgia, headache and axillary pain in 1 participant). Despite not receiving their second vaccinations, the three participants in the mRNA-1273 arm agreed to continue with safety assessments during the follow-up period. All participants received both vaccinations in the placebo arm and no participants discontinued from the study by 31 March 2021, the data cut-off date for this interim analysis. All 200 participants were included in the SAS and FAS; and TAK919/mRNA-1273 manuscript Vaccine 50 (98.0%) participants from the placebo arm. In total, 4 participants were excluded from the PPS: 3 in the mRNA-1273 arm because they did not receive a second vaccination and 1 in the placebo arm because their day 57 visit could not be completed by the data cut-off date.\n",
            " The baseline characteristics were generally balanced across the mRNA-1273 and placebo arms and in each age group ( Solicited local and systemic AEs through day 7 were mainly mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in severity in both arms after the first and second injections ( Figure 3A; Table 2 ). In the mRNA-1273 arm, the incidence of grade 2 or 3 solicited AEs increased after the second injection, particularly for systemic AEs. After the second vaccination, the incidence of grade 3 or In the mRNA-1273 arm, injection-site pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE after both the first and second vaccination and in both age groups (≥20 years to <65 years, after the second vaccination in the mRNA-1273 arm in both age groups (Figure 3) .\n",
            " Unsolicited AEs were reported in 45/150 (30.0%) participants who received mRNA-1273 and 11/50 (22.0%) participants who received placebo ( Table 3) MAAEs were reported in 7/150 (4.7%) participants who received mRNA-1273 and in 1/50 (2.0%) of participants who received placebo. The only MAAE reported by ≥2 participants in the mRNA-1273 arm was dental caries. No noteworthy differences by age group (≥20 to <65 years or ≥65 years) were observed in the unsolicited AE profile across the arms. No deaths, SAEs or AEs leading to a participant's withdrawal from study occurred in the 28 days after any injections.\n",
            " AEs leading to discontinuation from vaccination were reported in 3 participants in the mRNA-1273 arm. No SARS-CoV-2-infected participants were reported through to the data cut-off date.\n",
            " There were no clinically meaningful changes in safety clinical laboratory tests in either groups.\n",
            " In the mRNA-1273 arm, alanine aminotransferase increased, and aspartate aminotransferase increased were reported in 1 participant each (0.7%) as unsolicited AEs. These events were grade 1 in severity, resolved, and were considered to be unrelated to treatment (data not shown).\n",
            " Two doses of 100 μg mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart resulted in the induction of bAb for S-2P in all 147 (100%) participants from baseline by day 57, in the primary immunogenicity analysis.\n",
            " No such induction of bAb was observed in the placebo group ( For SCR, defined as percentage of participants with a change from below the LLOQ to equal to or above LLOQ, or a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline the placebo arm showed a 2.0% (95% CI: 0.1, 10.9) SCR on day 57 (Table 4) \n",
            " This was the first phase 1/2 study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in healthy Japanese adults aged 20 years or older. Two doses of 100 μg mRNA-1273 administered 28 days apart exhibited robust immune responses and an acceptable safety profile that was in line with US phase 2 and 3 mRNA-1273 studies [5, 6] . Based on the data from the present study and the US data, mRNA-1273 was approved for emergency use in Japan in May 2021 [11] .\n",
            " Local and systemic adverse events were predominantly grade 1-2 in severity, generally resolved within three days, and occurred at a similar incidence irrespective of age. While we must be careful in our assessment due to the difference in sample size between the studies, the incidence rate of some solicited AEs including grade 3 and grade 4 fever tended to be higher in this phase 1/2 study in a Japanese population compared with the phase 3 study in the USA.\n",
            " The incidence rates of any grade, grade 3 and grade 4 fever post second vaccination were 40.1% (59/147 participants), 4.8% (7/147 participants), and 0.7% (1/147 participants) in the present study versus 17.4% (1806/10352 participants), 1.6% (168/10352 participants), and <0.1% (10/10352 participants) in the US phase 3 study [5, 14] . However, the majority of solicited AEs in the mRNA-1273 group were grade 1-2 in severity and generally resolved within a few days in both studies. The difference in incidence rate of solicited AEs might be due to the same vaccine dose being administered to participants in Japan and US irrespective of mean body mass, which was higher among the US participants [15] . In the present study, mean body mass index was 22.39 (±2.65) kg/m 2 in the mRNA-1273 arm whereas in the US study participants had a mean body mass index of 29.3 (±6.9) kg/m 2 [5] . No specific concerns for the Japanese population were raised with regard to the unsolicited AEs identified. Hence, there was no clinically significant difference in safety profile between the Japanese phase 1/2 and US phase 3 study.\n",
            " Delayed-onset local reactions (defined as those with an onset on or after day 8) after either the first or second dose of mRNA-1273 were reported in both the US phase 3 study (rate after first dose, 0.8% [244/30,420 participants]; rate after second dose 0.2% [68/30,420 participants]) and in a subsequent case series [5, 16] . In the present study, we observed 8 relevant cases as described in the results, all of which were grade 1-2 in severity and resolved within the follow-up periods. The exact mechanism underlying delayed-onset local reactions is not known; however, delayed-type or T-cell mediated hypersensitivity is hypothesised [16] . Although such delayed reactions may be worrisome for people receiving the vaccine, neither delayed hypersensitivity reaction nor local injection-site reactions are considered contraindications to future doses [17] , and administration of the second vaccine dose is considered prudent given the robust acquired immune response we observed post-second dose.\n",
            " In the present study, Japanese adults who received two doses of 100 μg of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart induced robust immune response for both binding and neutralising antibodies against the recombinant S-2P protein or wild-type virus by day 57, with GMFRs >1000-fold (bAb) and >20-fold (nAb) respectively. In the present study, anti-S-2P bAb and nAb were produced in response to both doses of mRNA-1273 within 28 days (day 29) after the first vaccination, rising to peak titres by 14 days after the second vaccination (day 43) and then remaining elevated to day 57. SCR was 100% at day 57. A similar response pattern and time course was reported in a phase 2 study of mRNA-1273 conducted in healthy adults in the USA [6] .\n",
            " While vaccine efficacy (prevention of symptomatic virus infection) was not investigated in the present study, the immunogenicity findings and response patterns observed were similar to those observed in the phase 2 [6] and phase 3 (unpublished data) US studies, so we would anticipate that mRNA-1273 would achieve similar vaccine efficacy in Japanese populations. In a phase 3 US study of 30,420 volunteers of whom 2.2% had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (serologic or virologic, or both) at baseline, mRNA-1273 (100 μg) vaccine efficacy was shown to be 94.1% (95% CI: 89.3, 96.8; P<0.001) [5] . These findings further support the use of mRNA-1273 in the Japanese population.\n",
            " Nevertheless, given the continued evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is vital that further research is conducted to assess the efficacy of 100 μg mRNA-1273 against variants [18, 19] , and to examine safety and efficacy in paediatric populations. We acknowledge several limitations of our study. Because of the precautionary nature of phase 1/2 studies, our study was restricted by its small sample size and the efficacy of the vaccine as prophylaxis for COVID-19 was not assessed. Moreover, the study included only healthy adult participants aged ≥20 years so caution should be used when extrapolating results to populations with comorbid diseases that impact immune response, or in paediatric populations. Percentages are based on the number of randomised participants. Table 2 . Solicited adverse events within 7 days after injections (safety analysis set). Tables   Table 3 .

            " Vaccines represent one of the best advances in science and medicine, helping people around the world in eliminating and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Although many human vaccines have been developed and are in use, infectious diseases are still threats to people's health, especially during epidemic outbreaks. During the 2003 SARS outbreaks in Asia, there were more than 8,000 cases, and more than 800 deaths occurred, and the economic impact of SARS exceeded US$50 billion, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) report [1] . During the largest Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2015, more than 28,000 cases were reported, and there occurred more than 11,000 fatalities. It is estimated that Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have endured more than US$2 billion loss in economic growth as a result of Ebola virus disease outbreaks [2] . Based on the experiences from West Africa Ebola epidemic outbreaks, the WHO published a prioritized list of 11 pathogens that likely to cause outbreak situations, including Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Marburg virus, MRSA, Zika virus, etc. [3] . Some of these epidemic infectious disease vaccines are currently under development. As pointed out by the WHO, it will be a common goal for all countries to provide equitable access to high-quality, safe, affordable vaccines and immunization services throughout the life course.\n",
            " Vaccines have a long list of achievements in the past. Vaccines have been tremendously beneficial in protecting individuals and communities from serious infectious diseases and reducing healthcare costs around the world. In developed countries, vaccines are more readily available to infants, children, and adults. In the European region, more than 90% of children receive at least basic vaccination during infancy [4] . In China, overall vaccination rates for basic vaccines that are recommended to infants and children exceeded 90%, according to data published by the Chinese Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CCDC) [5] .\n",
            " In the USA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination programs, and each vaccine is approved by the regulatory agency US FDA. The immunization schedules are published by US CDC for different age groups including infants and children, adolescents, and adults. For example, the immunization schedule for infants from birth to 24 months includes vaccines against 14 potentially serious illnesses. US CDC data from the 2017 National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) database show that the vaccination rates are higher than 80% in the USA nationally [6] .\n",
            " Huge progress in vaccination has been made in the last 30 years. Now about 85% of children worldwide (about 116 million) receive essential, lifesaving vaccines, protecting them from infectious diseases including measles, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and polio. As vaccination rates increase from about 20% in 1980 to about 85% in 2017 (as shown in Fig. 1 ), the numbers of cases for measles and pertussis have decreased significantly, according to the WHO report [7] . This represents dedication and hard work by all, including public health workers, researchers, pharmaceutical industries, policy makers, parents, and communities.\n",
            " However, there are still gaps in vaccination programs in many countries. Out of 11.2 million children born in the EU region in 2012, more than 500,000 infants did not receive the complete three-dose series of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine before the first birthday. Data shows that there were more than 30,000 measles cases in the European region in recent years [4] . According to preliminary WHO data, measles increased by around 300% globally in the first 3 months of 2019, compared with the same time last year, with sizable increases in all regions of the world [7] . The reasons for children not getting their vaccines are diverse for different regions in the world; the major reasons are lack of access to vaccination services, and with Sub-Saharan Africa region that has the lowest coverage and the greatest burden of cases. There are about 20 million children in the world that are still not getting adequate coverage of basic vaccines.\n",
            " As indicated in European Vaccine Action Plan 2015-2020 (EVAP) [4] , EVAP's goal is to guide countries in the European region toward their joint vision of a region free of vaccine-preventable diseases. It establishes six goals which include sustaining polio-free status, eliminating measles and rubella, controlling hepatitis B infection, meeting regional vaccination coverage targets at all administrative levels throughout the region, making evidence-based decisions on introduction of new vaccines, and achieving financial sustainability of national immunization programs. \n",
            " Vaccine development involves many stakeholders and multiple disciplines including sciences, medicine, public health, regulatory agencies, manufacturers, healthcare professionals, vaccine safety professionals, and consumers [8] . In many countries, the government agencies play important roles in vaccine innovation, development, and commercialization. For example, in the USA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts and supports basic research, translational research, and clinical evaluation to identify new vaccine targets and to advance new vaccine candidates through product development pipelines. The regulatory agency US FDA is involved in vaccine review and licensing, regulatory sciences, manufacturing inspection, and post-licensure safety monitoring. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies, controls, and prevents infectious diseases through surveillance, detection and response, vaccine use recommendations, vaccine purchasing and service delivery, health communications, and post-marketing vaccine safety and effectiveness monitoring. Vaccines are highly regulated products and require extensive safety monitoring.\n",
            " In the USA, vaccines are regulated by the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and Office of Vaccines Research and Review (OVRR), where the authority resides in Section 351 of the US Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. CBER conducts thorough review of laboratory, manufacturing, and clinical data to ensure the safety, efficacy, purity, and potency of the vaccine products. Figure 2 illustrates the typical process of vaccine development and licensure. \n",
            " Vaccine developments are long, expensive processes with high financial risks. It may take more than 10 years and more than US$1 billion to develop a new innovative vaccine. In fact, cost data of developing new vaccines is usually scarce. According to Dimitrios Gouglas [9] , the average cost of successfully developing an epidemic infectious disease vaccine from preclinical to Phase 2a is estimated to be US$84-112 million (excluding the cost of facilities). Substantial investments are needed to develop the vaccines for these new targets. Innovation is the key to the future development of new vaccines to combat infectious diseases [10] .\n",
            " Although the cost of vaccine development is high, the benefits of vaccines are also significant. The development and licensure of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is a good example. The bacteria S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of pneumonia mortality globally and accounted for more deaths than all other causes (etiologies) combined in 2016. Most of these deaths occur in countries in Africa and Asia. Each year Streptococcus pneumoniae causes approximately 3,300 cases of meningitis, 100,000-135,000 cases of pneumonia requiring hospitalization, and six million cases of otitis media annually in the USA [11] . Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 7-valent (PCV7) was approved in year 2000 for its use in the USA. It was designed to cover the seven serotypes that account for about 80% of invasive infections in children younger than 6 years of age. In 2007, the WHO published a position paper recommending all countries to include PCV as part of the routine infant immunization schedule. PCV7 and later PCV13 (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) have been widely used in the world. There are 142 countries having put PCV13 into national immunization programs.\n",
            " Following the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in the USA (PCV7 in 2000 and PCV13 in 2010), there are about 90% reduction of pneumococcal diseases. Invasive pneumococcal disease decreased from 100 cases per 100,000 people in 1998 to 9 cases per 100,000 in 2015, according to the data published by US CDC [6] . Currently there are two approved PCV vaccines in the USA, including PCV10 developed and marketed by GSK and PCV13 (Prevnar 13) developed and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (Pfizer).\n",
            " Vaccine industries have achieved tremendous successes in the development of human vaccines that are currently in use. There are more than 200 vaccine clinical trials ongoing with more than 120 vaccine candidates for more than 40 infectious disease targets [12] . However, for the remaining targets, there are many significant challenges in developing new vaccines for these targets. The remaining infectious disease (ID) vaccine targets include those diseases affecting large populations such as respiratory syndrome virus (RSV) disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, etc. and emerging infectious diseases such as Lassa, Marburg, Ebola, MERS, and Zika listed in the WHO vaccine pipeline tracking sheet. As the development of new vaccines against these remaining targets faces significant challenges, the vaccine policy makers and the industries need to work together and encourage innovations through collaboration and support [13, 14] .\n",
            " To continue promote innovations in vaccine research and development, policy makers and regulatory agencies are recognizing the evolving development in sciences and medicine and using new approaches in vaccine review and approval (fast-track approach), as well as in the clinical trial design (demonstrated in the Ebola clinical trials in Africa during the 2018-2019 outbreaks) [15] .\n",
            " Vaccine manufacturing is a complex process. Vaccines take a long time to manufacture, ranging typically from 6 months to 36 months. During the manufacturing process, more than 50% of production time is usually dedicated to the quality control tests. During a vaccine manufacturing process, several hundred quality control tests may be required before releasing a batch of vaccine products. The ability to manufacture at the commercial scale is also very important.\n",
            " New vaccine commercialization is a complex and costly process [16] . Licensing of a new vaccine is based upon the demonstration of safety and effectiveness (through clinical evaluation) and the ability to be manufactured in a consistent manner (through process development and validation). The critical path toward developing safe and effective vaccines includes the following:\n",
            " • Speedy development of new technologies • Well-designed and well-operated facilities • Improved manufacturing methods and scale-up • Improved analytical evaluation tools and reference standards • Streamlined preclinical and clinical evaluations • Improved international cooperation • Effective vaccine review and release process • Improved product safety monitoring programs In the early phases of vaccine development and manufacturing, the following information are critical for addressing product safety aspects:\n",
            " • Source (biological seed or cell bank) characterization • Raw materials including biologically derived materials (such as cell culture, media, etc.) • Initial scalable process development • Initial product characterization • Testing/qualification/clearance of impurities, contaminants • Process control especially for safety of the products (e.g., sterilization, virus clearance where applicable)\n",
            " During the clinical development stages, the following chemical and manufacturing control (CMC) activities are important, and gradually phased-in approaches are usually taken: During the vaccine development and manufacturing process, applying current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) is very important to ensure product safety, efficacy, and consistency. It is highly recommended that cGMP be in effect for manufacture of products used in clinical studiesstarting from Phase 1. One should follow the general approaches and principles that are broadly applicable, tailoring cGMP applications to specific product, process, and facilities by assessing potential risks and taking appropriate actions (risk-based approach).\n",
            " A wide range of technologies have been used in developing successful vaccines, including:\n",
            " • Live attenuated bacteria and viruses (e.g., BCG, MMR, etc.) • Inactivated bacteria and viruses (e.g., whole-cell pertussis, IPV, etc.) • Proteins (e.g., diphtheria and tetanus toxoids) • Polysaccharides (PneumoVax) • Conjugated polysaccharides (e.g., meningococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV13) • Viruslike particles (VLPs) • Recombinant proteins • Application of mRNA • Adjuvant development and applications Many vaccines involve pathogens; thus there are special requirements for facility and equipment design depending on the biosafety levels. The manufacturing methods include traditional egg-based influenza manufacturing or newly developed cell culture-based bioreactor manufacturing. Traditional egg-based processes use millions of eggs each year and a large number of manual handlings during manufacturing and testing. Advances in automation of these steps have greatly enhanced the process consistency and reduced the potential contamination from human intervention. Fermentation processes often use stainless steel fermenters for the manufacturing of many current bacterial vaccines on the markets. Cell culturebased production processes are used in many viral vaccine products. The investigational new vaccine candidates often use single-use bioreactors. The advantages of single-use bioreactors include faster and lower cost of initial installation, faster development cycle, and quicker delivery of clinical trial materials. The disadvantages include higher cost of operations (disposable bioreactors) and potential issues with mechanical strengths in the joints and ports of the bioreactors.\n",
            " A typical vaccine manufacturing and product release process include the following steps:\n",
            " 1. Culture process: Selected bacterial strains or virus seeds or cells grow in appropriate culture media through fermentation or cell culture to generate the desired antigens. 2. Inactivation: Pathogens from the above culture are usually inactivated using chemical agents (e.g., formalin) or heat (e.g., 65 C). 3. Harvesting: Remove cells and cell debris from the product stream. Antigens are separated from the cells through filtration and/or centrifugation. 4. Purification: Impurities are removed from the harvest through purification methods such as ultrafiltration, chromatography, etc. The antigens are also concentrated during purification processes. 5. Detoxification of toxins: The pathogenicity is suppressed, and the immunogenicity is maintained in the product. 6. Bulk drug substance: The desired antigen is collected and stored under controlled temperatures for future use. 7. Formulation: Target antigens are assembled together with excipients to make final formulation. 8. Filling process: The final formulation is filled with automated filling machine under aseptic conditions into glass vials or prefilled syringes or other packaging containers. 9. Outer packaging: The filled vials or syringes are packaged into the secondary containers for future storage and shipping. 10. QC testing: Quality control laboratories conduct the quality control tests of the intermediates and the final product. 11. QA release: Quality assurance confirms that the product has been manufactured and tested according to approved specifications and procedures and can be released. 12. Final release for clinical trials: For clinical trials conducted in EU region, a qualified person (QP) releases the final product batch into the clinical trial usage.\n",
            " 13. Final release for distribution: For commercial vaccine products, many countries require that the National Regulatory Agency (NRA) release the final product for distribution into the market, such as in the USA, European Union, and China. 14. Product shipping: Most vaccine products currently are stored and shipped under cold-chain management, typically under 2-8 C, with very few products shipped under À60 C. 15. Product monitoring: After the product is released into the markets, product safety monitoring for serious adverse events (SAEs) is tracked and reported back to the manufacturers and to the regulatory agencies accordingly.\n",
            " In recent years, there are new trends in the manufacturing of vaccine products, and these include:\n",
            " It is more often that vaccine constructions are derived from recombinant technology, such as Shingrix vaccine, adenovirus-based Ebola vaccine (Ad5-EBOV), and rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine [17, 18] . Recombinant technology is used in a new recombinant pertussis vaccine development which provides higher product yield and less impurities.\n",
            " In recent years, single-use technology has been used more and more often in many new vaccine development and manufacturing processes. The advantages of using single-use technologies in vaccine development and manufacturing include:\n",
            " • Minimizing potential contamination • No need for equipment cleaning between batches • No need or less requirement for cleaning validation • Less initial capital costs • Fast and easy installation\n",
            " The disadvantages of single-use technologies include the following:\n",
            " • Need mechanical strength to avoid component breakup.\n",
            " • Installation of testing probes.\n",
            " • Mixing may not be as good as in stainless steel tanks.\n",
            " • Potential leachable and extractable materials from the bags.\n",
            " • Scalability depending on the bioreactor design.\n",
            " • More suitable for viral products than bacterial products. 164 H. H. Mao and S. Chao\n",
            " Recent advances in disposable manufacturing technologies and process analytical technologies (PAT) have made the continuous manufacturing possible. The application of continuous process in antibody manufacturing has been reported in a number of conferences by companies such as WuXi Biologics and Amgen. The development of purification technologies has enabled integration of continuous processes from upstream through to downstream to final bulk drug substances manufacturing. Application of continuous manufacturing in vaccines has gained attention from nonprofit organizations such as Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is reported (private conversation) that application of continuous manufacturing could result in a much lower cost of goods. The goal is to make vaccines affordable to everyone in the world. This will greatly improve the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in less developed nations, especially for GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) countries.\n",
            " The raw materials and media used for vaccine fermentation and purification processes are mostly animal component-free to avoid the potential BSE/TSE risks, especially for final products.\n",
            " One of the big challenges in the manufacturing of vaccine products is that materials used in Phase 3 clinical trials are typically manufactured in a commercial-scale facility. Many different technology platforms are used for various vaccines. It is difficult to standardize facilities and equipment. Unique facility and equipment are usually necessary for each vaccine or for each family of vaccines. There is a long lead time for building up a new commercial-scale manufacturing facility (typically 3-5 years), and large capital investment is often required.\n",
            " The successful scale-up requires deep understanding of the processes and conducting well-designed experiments to complete process scale-up. As demonstrated in the assessment of safety and immunogenicity of two different lots of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine manufactured using small-and large-scale manufacturing process, successful scaleup was completed and proved through clinical trial results [19] .\n",
            " During the manufacturing of biological products including vaccines, it is often considered that process is product, and the process/product is tightly linked with clinical experiences and outcomes. Major changes in manufacturing facilities or manufacturing processes may require regulatory approval or even conducting additional clinical trials. Thus for vaccine manufacturing, once a process is confirmed, it is usually not changed unless there is a strong reason to make a major change. This situation makes process improvements for existing vaccines challenging.\n",
            " Another manufacturing challenge lies in the large-scale process validation. It is an expensive exercise to produce full-scale process validation lots to meet regulatory filing (e.g., line-specific real-time stability requirements for fill and finish in the USA). In addition, vaccines are biological products that are typically with low fill volume but very high throughput (with million to tens of million doses annually); thus it is challenging to run product filling lines under aseptic conditions for a long period of time. Employee training and/or utilizing isolation technology is important. Moreover, live viral vaccine (such as FluMist, measles vaccine) or live bacterial vaccine (such as BCG vaccine) requires dedicated fill-and-finish facility to avoid potential contaminations.\n",
            " In addition, as current vaccines are typically temperature sensitive, thus they need cold-chain storage under 2-8 C or even lower temperatures (À20 C or À60 C). This generates significant challenges for handling in-process holding and final product storage as well as supply chain management. Large cold rooms are required in the manufacturing areas to meet the cold-chain storage requirements. Consistent electrical power supplies to these cold storage areas are essential to maintain the cold temperature control all the time. Most vaccine producers maintain emergency backup power supply in the event of power outages; the power supply can be switched to the backup power supply quickly.\n",
            " Another significant challenge is the unpredictability of demand for seasonal vaccines (e.g., flu vaccines) and vaccines for emergency use (such as Ebola vaccine). The vaccine manufacturers will need advanced procurement and significant lead time to prepare raw materials, facilities and equipment, quality control, and human resources for the production of these vaccines.\n",
            " Vaccines, unlike other pharmaceutical products, are often perceived as being not well characterized due to their complex structures and properties. The implications are that Phase 3 clinical trials need to be conducted using clinical trial materials made in large-scale manufacturing facilities to ensure the consistency of Phase 3 clinical materials with the commercial products. The other approach is to conduct clinical bridging studies to demonstrate equivalence of Phase 3 clinical trial materials with commercial materials. The potential impact of this requirement is twofold: (1) delay in final facility readiness and (2) requirement of large capital investment in facilities much ahead of time. Thus it is very important to perform characterization of vaccine products as early as possible, to avoid or minimize costly changes later in the Phase 3 clinical trial stages.\n",
            " In general, vaccines are very heterogeneous in structure. As greater characterization of vaccines becomes more prevalent, it may be possible to connect structural changes in the vaccine components with changes in potency and toxicity. This, in turn, may provide a better understanding of how certain vaccines function and interact with the immune system. Information gained in this area will undoubtedly improve the effectiveness and safety of future vaccines.\n",
            " Vaccines can be divided into three major categories: live vaccines, killed or attenuated vaccines, and component (subunit) vaccines. The component vaccines are generally the more easily characterized. They usually consist of a relatively small number of immunogenic components. The live or killed/attenuated vaccines include complex biological components such as attenuated or killed viruses and intact bacteria or multiple bacterial components. Advances in proteomics make the characterization of even these difficult vaccines more manageable.\n",
            " Characterization of vaccine generally involves analysis of bacterial strains, virus seeds, cell banks, intermediates, bulk drug substance, formulated final bulk, and finished product. Various physical, chemical, and biological tests are used for the analyses of these different biological materials. The purpose of these characterization tests is to ensure product quality and consistency.\n",
            " For genetically modified bacterial strains used for vaccine manufacturing, the following tests need to be performed in addition to generally accepted characterization tests of bacterial strains:\n",
            " • Genotype verification by PCR • Verification of linear plasmid DNA • Gene sequence verification • Verification of flanking sequence Table 1 is an example of quality tests on a pre-master seed for a genetically modified bacterial seed (recombinant pertussis vaccine under development) for GMP material manufacturing.\n",
            " Cell-based processes are used in viral vaccine development and manufacturing. The characterization of both viral seeds and cell lines is required. In addition, biological raw materials used in manufacturing processes should also be characterized with clear source of origin with potential risks of introduction of adventitious agents or viruses into the process and product stream. For viral product, US FDA guidance \"Characterization and Qualification of Cell Substrates and Other Biological Materials Used in the Production of Viral Vaccines for Infectious Disease Indications\" has clearly outlined the requirements for characterization of cell substrates, cell banking, viral seeds, vaccine intermediates, and biological raw materials at different stages of vaccine development [20] . For viral subunit vaccine product manufacturing, the most important factor is to prevent contaminations from adventitious materials and other contaminants in all stages of processes. It is important to demonstrate viral clearance through process validation.\n",
            " However, live attenuated viruses, whole inactivated virus, or viruslike particles often cannot be purified as rigorously as viral subunit vaccines. Unlike the production of protein products, it is not possible to introduce validated viral inactivation or removal steps to mitigate these risks. Addressing these issues requires application of GMP principles and approaches in development programs at a very early stage, focusing on the history, purity, and stability of the viral seeds, cell banks, and biological raw materials. For viral vector-based vaccine development, it is now common for a viral vector to be rescued from synthesized plasmids, allowing for traceability of the viral vector and full sequencing to be performed of the plasmids and resulting viral vector. Studies can also be performed to demonstrate genetic stability of vectors at an early stage of development. For manufacturing cell lines, it is essential that the origins are known with clear history and that they are free from adventitious agents and that generation of cell banks for both process development and production meet GMP requirements. In addition, it is very important to maintain segregation in the processes throughout development programs to prevent potential contamination of viral stocks and cell banks.\n",
            " Although the production of viral vectors poses a number of technical challenges in cell culture, recovery, characterization, and analytical perspective, but with recombinant viral vector systems, where the virus is essentially used as a delivery vehicle and the manufacturing approach is independent of the genes it carries, a platform process can be developed. Therefore, the application of a platform can be developed for the production of those vaccines based on viral vectors, such as adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), and lentivirus.\n",
            " For cell substrates (cell lines) intended for vaccine manufacturing, the following characterization tests or documentation needs to be provided:\n",
            " • Cell substrate properties such as plasmid sequence, phenotype, and expression of antigens • Source of the cell line including species of origin and the tissue type The passage history and derivation history of viral seeds intended for vaccine manufacturing should also be well documented, including:\n",
            " • Sourcing of each biological starting material (e.g., plasmids, parental viruses) • Donor screening, testing, and donor medical history • Any manipulation of the viral phenotype, such as cold adaptation and development of temperature sensitivity • Any attenuation of virulence and genetic manipulations such as reassortment or recombination • Nucleic acid sequences • Growth characteristics on production cell substrate • Genetic markers • Long-term storage conditions • Viability during storage • Genetic stability through production • Absence of adventitious agents\n",
            " Other biological raw materials such as serum and other biologically sourced raw materials should also be controlled to prevent adventitious material contaminations.\n",
            " The continuous development of safe, effective, and innovative vaccines around the world calls for new technologies, not only in the vaccine discovery areas but also the new technologies for characterization of vaccines.\n",
            " The traditional methods of vaccine characterization rely on the study of physicalchemical properties using methods such as differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), pH, various stress conditions (agitation, freeze-thaw, etc.) based on particulate formation, and methods of quantitating protein content as well as elemental composition. While these methods are capable of determining whether or not the end product is consistent with previous batches, they are unable to detect small changes that can result in a vaccine with reduced or even lost immunogenicity. Not all changes to the structure of the vaccine components have physical consequences, but many of them result in reduced vaccine effectiveness. Most of these techniques lack sensitivity when it comes to detecting small changes in the structure of the vaccine components that can cause them to fail during use. Some changes can cause severe side reactions even in small quantities.\n",
            " TGA and DSC are used to analyze the denaturing point of the vaccine protein or nucleotide. These tests generally give indirect indications of changes in the vaccine with time and stress. Changes in protein sequence or modifications can substantially affect denaturing kinetics, but these techniques provide no way to correlate these changes with actual changes in the structure of the molecule.\n",
            " Appearance and pH are used to monitor major changes in the composition of the vaccines and are relatively insensitive to these changes. Other physical characteristics that affect vaccine function include particle size and particle size distribution. Clumping of the vaccine antigen can degrade the function of the vaccine and can 170 H. H. Mao and S. Chao cause unwanted side effects. Specific tests for quantitating proteins or oligonucleotides, such as elemental analysis and total protein content (bicinchoninic acid or BCA) tests, can provide vital quality control data for troubleshooting manufacturing problems, but they are of limited value in analyzing degradation of the vaccines since elemental composition changes from degrades represent only a small percentage of the overall elemental composition. In addition, most protein degrades will still be identified as proteins in a total protein analysis. The conditions used for these assays also break up clumped proteins or oligonucleotides and are insensitive to most changes caused by minor structural modifications of these molecules. Besides the traditional physical and chemical tests for vaccines, advanced technologies such as high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, chromatography, and polymerase chain reaction \n",
            " Like other pharmaceutical products, the development of new vaccines will include clinical testing phases. Through well-controlled clinical trials, data will be collected to demonstrate that the vaccine product has an effect on clinical endpoint or a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on clinical, serologic, epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to provide clinical benefits.\n",
            " Generally, clinical trials for vaccines include clinical trials from Phase 1 to Phase 3 and Phase 4 post-approval. Phase 1 clinical trial is to test the initial safety and tolerability of the candidate vaccine; Phase 2 clinical trials test the safety, immunogenicity, and dose ranges; and Phase 3 clinical trials are for additional safety data, immunogenicity, and efficacy.\n",
            " Prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical trials, it is recommended that the vaccine developer has continuous dialogue with regulatory agencies to discuss study details such as disease prevention or treatment; study sites; subject selection; choice of control group; trial design including endpoints, case definitions, diagnostic tests, dose selection, dosing schedule, study duration, concomitant vaccinations, and medications; and safety assessments to ensure that they meet the intended goals for clinical trial and product licensure. Vaccines are approved for licensure from regulatory agencies if clinical trial data show that the product is safe, pure, and potent and that the manufacturing facility meets the standards designed to assure that the vaccine product continues to be safe, pure, effective, and non-inferior when administered with concomitant vaccines.\n",
            " From regulatory point of view, the proof of effectiveness of a vaccine would consist of controlled clinical investigations that are adequate and well-controlled studies, unless waived as not applicable to the vaccine product or when an alternative method is adequate to substantiate effectiveness, such as using serological response data where a previously accepted correlation with clinical effectiveness exists [21] .\n",
            " The effectiveness may be proven by a well-designed, single clinical study. In the case of preventive vaccines, one adequate and well-controlled clinical trial may be supported by compelling animal challenge/protection models, human serological data, passive antibody data, or pathogenesis information.\n",
            " Phase 3 vaccine clinical trials usually use the same scale of manufacturing and make clinical trial materials in the intended commercial manufacturing facilities. This requirement has made it challenging for the vaccine developers, as the facilities need to be ready long before the vaccine can be approved for commercial launch.\n",
            " Unlike other therapeutic biological products, the efficacy of Phase 3 clinical trials for vaccines usually needs to demonstrate the protection of healthy people from a particular disease in the target population. Thus depending on the disease burden of a particular candidate vaccine, the Phase 3 efficacy clinical trial can be very large, enrolling several thousand or more healthy volunteers. For example, the recently approved Shingrix vaccine had Phase 3 clinical trials with more than 17,000 people enrolled. Thus Phase 3 clinical trials for preventive vaccine are usually very lengthy and costly. It is estimated that the cost of Phase 3 clinical trials of preventive vaccines may exceed US$100 million [9] .\n",
            " Vaccine immunogenicity is often tested in the clinical trials. For example, during the clinical trials conducted for Ad5-EBOV Ebola virus disease vaccine, the Ebolaspecific antibody responses against the vaccine-matched 2014 Zaire-Makona glycoprotein (GP) were assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, and anti-adenovirus type-5 neutralizing antibody titers were detected with a serum neutralization assay before and after vaccination. GP-specific IgG titers are 172 H. H. Mao and S. Chao the important data for the immune response of the vaccine. Anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibody detection was used to analyze the vector immunity and the preexisting immunity influence on the vaccine's immunogenicity. Specific T-cell response was quantified by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay (IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α), and IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells when phase I and phase Ib clinial trials were conducted in China. Another phase 2 clinical trial was conducted in Sierra Leone in 2015 [22] [23] [24] . The study results demonstrated that one shot of intramuscular injection with Ad5-EBOV vaccine could elicit strong humoral and cellular immune response in three clinical trials. Ad5-EBOV vaccine produced a considerable GP antibody response and GP-specific T-cell response in healthy African participants in China after 14 days [22] . GP antibody response peaked at day 28 and lasted more than 6 months. With a booster at the sixth month, the GP antibody response can last more than 12 months. The pre-exsiting immunity to Ad5 can be overcome with selected vaccine dosage. Another example is Shingrix vaccine. Shingrix is a recombinant, subunit vaccine designed to restore VZV immunity in individuals who are at increased risk of developing Shingles due to age or immunodeficiency [25] . VZV gE is the most abundant envelope glycoprotein, predominantly expressed on the surface of virusinfected cells. The VZV gE protein plays a critical role in virus infectivity since it is involved in virus entry and cell-to-cell spread, harboring sites for N-and O-linked glycosylation. The subunit vaccine elicits stronger virus-specific CD4+ T-cell response as well as antibody B-cell response to gE, compared to the currently used live attenuated vaccine (Zostavax ® ). Evidence indicates that the gE protein induces both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses. The gE antigen component of Shingrix is derived from a VZV strain that was isolated from a patient with severe varicella disease. This antigen is a recombinant truncated form of VZV gE. The recombinant protein is then produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that were genetically modified to express the VZV gE gene [26] .\n",
            " There are many vaccine clinical trials ongoing for various vaccine candidates, and these are published in the website either at clinicaltrial.gov or at clinicaltrialsregister. eu.\n",
            " A combination vaccine consists of two or more live organisms, inactivated organisms, or purified antigens either combined by the manufacturer as a single product or mixed immediately before administration. It is intended to prevent multiple diseases or to prevent one disease caused by different strains or serotypes of the same organism. The clinical studies are designed to demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of combination vaccines through randomized, controlled studies. The efficacy of each component should be demonstrated in clinical studies. Ideally, clinical trials will be prospective, randomized, and controlled. Endpoints used to evaluate efficacy in these trials can range from disease incidence to a wellestablished correlation of protection [27] .\n",
            " Vaccine development and clinical trials generally take stepwise approaches starting from adults to children. For routine vaccines aiming for pediatric applications, clinical trials in children's population groups are normally required, such as meningococcal vaccine, PCV vaccine, DTcP vaccine, etc. However, for some global infectious diseases such as malaria or Ebola virus disease, children suffer the same or even greater risks as their immune systems are not as strong as those of adults. It was reported that during the Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, about one third of the reported cases were from children or adolescents under 18 years of age [28] . Thus it is important to include children and adolescents in the vaccine development programs for global infectious diseases unless a waiver is granted by the regulatory agencies. In some cases, if the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the regulators may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, supplemented with other information obtained in pediatric subjects, such as immune response studies, as pointed out in the US FDA guidance [29] .\n",
            " For vaccine clinical trials including pregnant women in the population groups, reproductive toxicity studies need to be completed prior to including them.\n",
            " For certain global infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that are serious and/or life-threatening, accelerated approval may be granted using a surrogate endpoint or a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity for a vaccine that provides meaningful clinical benefits for preventing the spread of infectious diseases or therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments [29] .\n",
            " For some special vaccine products, approval may be granted based on evidence of effectiveness from studies in animals when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible [30] . In such cases, after approval, a sponsor must conduct post-marketing studies, such as field studies, to verify and describe the biological product's clinical benefit and to assess its safety when used as indicated in circumstances where such studies are feasible and ethical. One example of applying \"animal rule\" is the approval of anthrax vaccine by the US FDA [31]. 174 H. H. Mao and S. Chao In recent years, several new vaccines are approved in different countries around the world. Brief descriptions are given in the following sections.\n",
            " Shingles causes painful rash of fluid-filled blisters and sometimes causes chronic pain. Shingles is a virus that results from reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (type 3 herpes zoster), the virus that causes chicken pox. Chicken pox is the initial infection, and shingles is the reactivation of the virus years later. Shingles may be developed at any age but most common for people aged over 50 years. Shingles causes substantial pain that can interfere with activities of daily living and reduce the quality of life. The estimated average overall incidence of shingles is about 3.4-4.8 per 1,000 person years which increases to more than 11 per 1,000 person years in those aged over 80 years in Europe, according to Robert W. Johnson's study [32] . Shingles is the third most common cause of chronic neuropathic pain in the USA, with an estimate of approximately 500,000 cases yearly. Vaccination is an effective way to reduce the incidence of shingles. Two vaccines against shingles have been approved by the US FDA. Merck developed zoster vaccine live (ZVL, Zostavax), and it has been in use since 2006 for people 60 years and older.\n",
            " The second vaccine for shingles has been developed by GSK Company. Shingrix is a recombinant zoster vaccine with adjuvant and is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in adults aged 50 years and older. It has two doses; the second dose is administered 2-6 months after the first dose [33] .\n",
            " Since its approval in 2017, Shingrix has obtained tremendous success in marketplace in the USA and internationally, as the sales of Shingrix exceeded US$1 billion in 2018. It is recommended by ACIP as the preferred shingles vaccine for people aged 50 years and older.\n",
            " Shingrix is a suspension for injection supplied as a single-dose vial of lyophilized varicella zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE) antigen component reconstituted with the accompanying vial of AS01B adjuvant suspension component. After reconstitution, a single dose of Shingrix is 0.5 mL. The gE antigen is obtained by culturing genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which carry a truncated gE gene, in media containing amino acids, with no albumin, antibiotics, or animalderived proteins. The gE protein is purified by several chromatographic steps, formulated with excipients, filled into vials, and lyophilized. The adjuvant suspension component is AS01B, which is composed of 3-O-desacyl-4 0 -monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) from Salmonella minnesota and QS-21, a saponin purified from plant extract Quillaja saponaria Molina, combined in a liposomal formulation. The liposomes are composed of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and cholesterol in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing disodium phosphate anhydrous, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, and water for injection. After reconstitution, each 0.5 mL dose is formulated to contain 50 μg of the recombinant gE antigen, 50 μg of MPL, and 50 μg of QS-21. Each dose also contains 20 mg of sucrose (as stabilizer), 4.385 mg of sodium chloride, 1 mg of DOPC, 0.54 mg of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.25 mg of cholesterol, 0.160 mg of sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, 0.15 mg of disodium phosphate anhydrous, 0.116 mg of dipotassium phosphate, and 0.08 mg of polysorbate 80. After reconstitution, Shingrix is a sterile, opalescent, and colorless to pale brownish liquid. Shingrix does not contain preservatives. Each dose may also contain residual amounts of host cell proteins ( 3.0%) and DNA ( 2.1 picogram) from the manufacturing process [33] .\n",
            " Shingrix has gone through multiple clinical trials. Overall, 17,041 adults aged 50 years and older received at least 1 dose of Shingrix in 17 clinical studies. The safety of Shingrix was evaluated by pooling data from 2 placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1 and 2) involving 29,305 subjects aged 50 years and older who received at least 1 dose of Shingrix (n ¼ 14,645) or saline placebo (n ¼ 14,660) administered according to a 0-and 2-month schedule. Both studies were conducted in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. In the overall 4 population, the majority of subjects were white (74.3%), followed by Asian (18.3%), black (1.4%), and other racial/ethnic groups (6.0%), and 58% were female. The safety profile was acceptable. Phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated that Shingrix has been shown to be highly efficacious with VE against shingles of 97.2% in subjects over 50 years of age and 91.3% in subjects over 70 years of age [34] .\n",
            " Shingrix is currently under significant shortage in the USA and around the world. This supply issue is a common problem with many successful vaccines. When the products do well because of their effectiveness, vaccine developers are struggling to supply. It is good to address these supply issues and how to mitigate it ahead of time. GSK announced in April 2019 that it plans to expand its manufacturing facility in Montana with a capital investment of US$100 million.\n",
            " Ebola viruses (EBOVs) are enveloped, non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Filoviridae. They are known to cause lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates with a mortality rate of 40-90% [35, 36] . Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. EBOVs are transmitted among humans through close contact with infected blood, bodily fluids, or tissues; moreover, the intentional release of EBOVs would probably result in mucosal infection by smallparticle aerosol dispersion.\n",
            " From 1976 when the Ebola virus was first discovered to June 2019, there have been more than 30 epidemic outbreaks in Africa causing tens of thousands of deaths.\n",
            " The species of Ebola viruses were mainly Zaire and Sultan types, and the outbreak sites were concentrated in Central Africa, in countries such as Congo, Sultan, Uganda, and South Africa. The 2014 outbreak in West Africa has been one of the worst Ebola epidemics. On August 8, 2014, the WHO director general declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [37] .\n",
            " Many methods have been used to develop EBOV vaccines. Some of the vaccine candidates have been tested in nonhuman primates (NHP) and showed good protection. These vaccine candidates include inactivated vaccine, subunit vaccine, non-replicated virus vector vaccine, and replicated virus vector vaccine. Most of them were developed to protect against Zaire ebolavirus. In the past a few years, the protective mechanism of vaccine has also been studied, and the results showed that the antibody protection is essential.\n",
            " A recombinant Ebola virus disease vaccine (Ad5-EBOV) has been successfully developed jointly by Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and CanSino Biologics Inc. (CanSinoBIO). The preclinical research of the recombinant Ebola virus disease vaccine (adenovirus type-5 vector) (Ad5-EBOV) was initiated in 2006. The key technology in vaccine preparation and evaluation was based on the Ebola GP antigen. A significant gene sequence variation of the GP antigen in the Zaire Ebola virus strain has been identified in the 2014 Ebola epidemic outbreaks in West Africa. To ensure the effectiveness of the vaccine, Ad5-EBOV vaccine was designed according to the 2014 Ebola virus genotype. The vaccine candidate was tested in animal models to confirm the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy. Challenge studies in guinea pigs and NHPs (cynomolgus monkeys) conducted in biosafety level 4 (BL-4) lab in Public Health Agency of Canada also confirmed that the vaccine candidate is 100% effective in protecting guinea pigs and NHPs from Ebola virus infection.\n",
            " CanSinoBIO started the development of recombinant Ebola virus disease vaccine at the end of 2014 as the Ebola virus disease outbreaks occurred in West Africa. The HEK293 cell line used for Ad5-EBOV production was licensed from National Research Council (NRC), Canada. The production process has been scaled up successfully. All key materials, intermediates, and final product (including virus seeds, cell banks, purified bulk, and final product) are QC tested and released internally. The entire production process for EBOV vaccine is animal componentfree. The process of large-scale production of adenoviruses has been well characterized and optimized. Several vaccines and biological products have been developed using the Ad5 vector-based technology [38] . The platform technology applied to Ad5 vector-based production has been demonstrated by Ad5-EBOV to be robust and scalable and with high productivity.\n",
            " In 2015, CanSino obtained a clinical trial permit from the Chinese Food Drug Administration (NMPA, formerly CFDA) and from the Government of Sierra Leone. The Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials conducted in China and Sierra Leone involved a total of 681 subjects, and the clinical trial results indicated that the Ad5-EBOV vaccine is safe and immunogenic. The immune response level in human is comparable with that of rVZV-ZEBOV vaccine developed by Merck. Clinical trial results demonstrated that Ad5-EBOV is well tolerated with good safety profile in tested subjects between ages 18 and 60. The GMTs of anti-GP antibody peaked around 28 days after vaccination regardless of the dose levels. Satisfactory immune response can be reached at dosage of 8 Â 10 10 VP per dose. Pre-existing immunity to Ad5 vector can be overcome by proper dose selection (8 Â 10 10 VP/dose), and the conversion rate is 100%. Ad5-EBOV response is fast and longlasting, and these features could offer help in Ebola virus disease outbreak situation.\n",
            " In October 2017, the new drug registration application (NDA) for recombinant Ebola virus vaccine (adenovirus type-5 vector) was approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). The manufacturing facilities, including QC testing center, are fully validated and in operation at CanSinoBIO.\n",
            " Currently approved meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine (MenACYW135) is given to preteens and teens at age 11 or 12 years with a booster dose at 16 years to protect against serotypes A, C, Y, and W135. In 2014-2015, another meningococcal subgroup B vaccine (Bexsero and Trumenba) [39, 40] were approved for adolescent and adult population aged 10-25 years who are at increased risk of meningococcal B diseases. Bexsero is an FDA-approved vaccine to prevent invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup. It is not recommended for routine vaccination at this point.\n",
            " In fact, meningitis subgroup B infection is very rare in the USA. Among all 11-23-year-old adolescents and young adults in the USA, between 50 and 60 cases are reported annually, with 5-10 deaths. According to the CDC, there were 7 outbreaks on college campuses from 2009 to 2013, with 41 cases and 3 deaths [41] .\n",
            " Bexsero was developed by Novartis and is now marketed by the GSK Company. It is a sterile suspension of three recombinant proteins and meningococcal outer membrane vesicles (OMV). The recombinant proteins neisserial adhesin A (NadA), neisserial heparin binding antigen (NHBA), and factor H binding protein (fHbp) are individually produced in Escherichia coli and purified. The OMV component is produced from N. meningitidis strain NZ98/254 (expressing outer membrane protein P or A serosubtype P1.4). The antigens are adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide. Each 0.5 mL dose of Bexsero is formulated to contain 50 μg each of recombinant proteins NadA, NHBA, and fHbp, 25 μg of OMV, 1.5 mg aluminum hydroxide, 3.125 mg sodium chloride, 0.776 mg histidine, and 10 mg sucrose at pH 6.4-6.7 according to the product insert [39] . Bexsero is a suspension for intramuscular injection in 0.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringes. Two doses are given at least 1 month apart from the first dose.\n",
            " Another approved meningococcal group B vaccine is Trumenba ® developed by Pfizer, initially approved in 2014. Trumenba is a bivalent meningococcal group B vaccine that contains two factor H binding proteins (fHBP) from Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) serogroup B. fHBP is a conserved, outer membrane 178 H. H. Mao and S. Chao lipoprotein and a virulence factor that contributes to the ability of the bacteria to avoid host defenses. Trumenba is a sterile suspension of two recombinant lipidated factor H binding protein (fHBP) variants, one from each of the two antigenically distinct fHBP subfamilies subfamily A and subfamily B (A05 and B01, respectively). These proteins are also known as rLP2086 proteins. The proteins are individually produced in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified. Each 0.5 mL dose of Trumenba is formulated to contain 60 μg of each fHBP variant subtype (120 μg total protein), 0.018 mg of polysorbate 80, and 0.25 mg of Al3+ as AlPO4 in 10 mM histidinebuffered saline at pH 6.0, according to the product insert [40] . Trumenba is approved for use in individuals from 10 through 25 years of age.\n",
            " Later in 2017, Trumenba vaccine was approved for three doses schedule (a dose administered at 0, 1-2, and 6 months) by US FDA. Additional clinical trial results also demonstrated that it is safe to co-administer Trumenba vaccine with meningococcal (groups A, C, Y, and W135) polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed in persons 10 years to less than 13 years of age.\n",
            " Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted virus. It is passed through genital contact or by skin-to-skin contact. HPV infection causes benign and malignant dysplastic anogenital disease in men and women. Nearly 100% of cervical cancers and 90% of anal cancers are caused by oncogenic HPV types. GARDASIL 9, human papillomavirus 9-valent recombinant vaccine, was developed by Merck and initially approved by US FDA in 2014. Prior to the licensure of GARDASIL 9, Merck's 4-valent HPV vaccine, GARDASIL, was licensed in 2006. GARDASIL protects against disease caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. GARDASIL 9 includes the original four HPV types in GARDASIL, plus an additional five types, HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. GARDASIL 9 is indicated in girls and women aged 9-26 years for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 , and 58 and genital warts (condyloma acuminata) caused by HPV types 6 and 11. GARDASIL 9 is also indicated in boys and men aged 9-26 years for the prevention of anal cancer caused by HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 , and 58 and genital warts (condyloma acuminata) caused by HPV types 6 and 11.\n",
            " A 0.5 mL dose of GARDASIL 9 contains recombinant viruslike particles (VLPs) of the major capsid (L1) protein of HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 , and 58 adsorbed on preformed aluminum-containing adjuvant (amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate or AAHS). The amounts of HPV type L1 protein in each dose are as follows: 30 μg/40 μg/60 μg/40 μg/20 μg/20 μg/20 μg/20 μg/20 μg, respectively. It is available as a suspension in 0.5 mL single-dose vials or prefilled syringes, for intramuscular administration in two doses at months 0 and 2-6 month or three doses at months 0, 2, and 6 according to product insert [42] .\n",
            " Dengue infection is caused by dengue virus which includes four known serotypes (dengue virus 1, 2, 3, and 4), all transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitos, as well as other members of the Aedes mosquito family. Annually, an estimated 390 million dengue infections occur worldwide, of which approximately 100 million are associated with clinical manifestations, 500,000 with hospitalization, and 20,000 with death [43] . Dengue disease is a major public health concern in more than 128 countries. It is endemic in Asia, the Pacific area, Africa, and Latin America with the four dengue virus serotypes found in tropical and subtropical regions, including some European territories. Dengue is endemic in the US territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands [44] [45] [46] .\n",
            " A dengue tetravalent vaccine is developed by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. and is approved by US FDA in May 2019. DENGVAXIA is a live, attenuated, tetravalent, chimeric virus vaccine, containing the replication genes and the capsid gene from the attenuated yellow fever [17D] virus and the Pre-M and ENV genes from each of the four serotypes (CYD). Each CYD virus is purified from Vero cells.\n",
            " The indication of DENGVAXIA vaccine is for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 in individuals 9 through 16 years of age with laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and living in endemic areas. Previous dengue infection can be assessed through a medical record of a previous laboratory-confirmed dengue infection or through current serotesting. The safety and effectiveness of the vaccine were determined in three randomized, placebo-controlled studies involving approximately 35,000 individuals in dengueendemic areas, including Puerto Rico, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region. The vaccine was approximately 76% effective in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed dengue disease in population 9 through 16 years of age who previously had laboratory-confirmed dengue disease. DENGVAXIA has already been approved in 19 countries and has been approved by the European Union.\n",
            " DENGVAXIA is supplied as a vial of lyophilized powder containing each of the four virus components that is reconstituted at the time of use with the supplied sodium chloride diluent (0.4% NaCl). After reconstitution, each 0.5 mL dose of DENGVAXIA is formulated to contain 4.5-6.0 log10 CCID50 of each of the CYD virus components. The reconstituted vaccine is administered subcutaneously in three doses at 6-month intervals (at day 0, month 6, and month 12) according to product insert [47] .\n",
            " Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major causative agents of outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina in Asia. An EV71 (Enterovirus 71) vaccine has been developed by Sinovac Biotech (China) using Vero cell and EV71 C4 subgenotype. The Phase 2 study of inactivated vaccine (Vero cell) against EV71 virus has been completed in December 2011 in China. The purpose of the Phase 2 clinical study was to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of EV71 vaccine in preventing hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by EV71 in a total of 10,000 healthy infant volunteers aged from 6 to 35 months old. The data from Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies suggested that the inactivated EV71 vaccine had clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for healthy Chinese infants. A Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted in China in 2014 with 10,007 healthy infants and young children (6-35 months of age). The vaccine efficacy against EV71-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina was 94.8%. Vaccine efficacies against EV71associated hospitalization and hand, foot, and mouth disease with neurologic complications were both 100%. In the immunogenicity subgroup (1,291 children), an anti-EV71 immune response was elicited by the two-dose vaccine series in 98.8% of participants at day 56. An anti-EV71 neutralizing antibody titer of 1:16 was associated with protection against EV71-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . EV71 vaccine was approved by the Chinese Drug Administration (formerly CFDA) in 2017.\n",

            " A new HBV vaccine, recombinant, with adjuvant (Heplisav-B) has been developed by Dynavax Technologies Corporation for preventing hepatitis B virus infections. The product contains 20 μg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen with 3,000 μg adjuvant 1018, which is a novel cytosine phosphoguanine (CpG)-enriched oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) phosphorothioate adjuvant. The indication and usage are for immunization against infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus in adults 18 years of age and older. The product Heplisav-B (rHBsAg-1018 ISS), recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg), subtype adw, is produced in yeast cells. The dosage contains two 0.5 mL doses administered 4 weeks apart.\n",

            " Although rVSV-EBOV has not been officially approved for licensing yet, it is in the process of applying licensure both with US FDA and with EMA in Europe. It has obtained fast-track review and breakthrough status. It has completed Phase 3 clinical trials and demonstrated its safety and efficacy [61] . In July 2015, clinical results of the Ebola ça Suffit ring vaccination Phase 3 cluster-randomized trial of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in Guinea were obtained and published in Lancet. On the basis of interim analysis, the trial showed 100% vaccine efficacy, with 75.1% vaccine effectiveness at the cluster level, including herd immunity of unvaccinated members of clusters.\n",
            " In March 2016, an rVSV-ZEBOV expanded access and compassionate use trial was conducted, named as \"Ring vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV under expanded access in response to an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea,\" and the interim results were published in Lancet. The ring vaccination strategy was used between Ebola and the contacts. A total of 1,510 individuals were vaccinated in four rings in Guinea, including 303 individuals aged between 6 years and 17 years and 307 frontline workers. The results show that a ring vaccination strategy can be rapidly and safely implemented at scale in response to Ebola virus disease outbreaks in rural settings.\n",
            " Although there are a lot of progress made in recent combat to Ebola outbreaks in Congo, and the data published by Gsell and Camacho [62] regarding the ring vaccination results demonstrated 100% efficacy of rVSV vaccine, it is worrisome that a survivor of Ebola virus disease previously in Guinea in the 2014 outbreak had Ebola virus after 531 days and caused another round of Ebola infections among the people he was in contact with. We need much better tools to monitor the situation [63] .\n",
            " In addition, despite significant progress in the characterization of the response to vaccination, correlation of protection (CoP) against Ebola virus infection has not been established in humans [64] . This holds true even for rVSV-ZEBOV, the most advanced Ebola vaccine candidate and the only one with demonstrated efficacy in humans so far when this chapter is published. This is especially challenging in emergency outbreaks settings, and major efforts would be required to ensure that samples and data are collected from the clinical trial participants. During emergency outbreaks, it is very difficult to track those people and to collect samples for further testing. Integration of data from preclinical and clinical vaccine studies together with data from disease survivors will thus be essential to identify Ebola vaccine correlates 182 H. H. Mao and S. Chao of protection. The information generated for rVSV-ZEBOV may help identify the CoP of the other Ebola vaccine candidates, although these may also be different.\n",
            " Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of viral lower respiratory tract illness in infants and children globally, but no vaccine is currently approved to protect these vulnerable populations. RSV is transmitted by direct and indirect contact with nasal or oral secretions and causes repeat infections throughout life and significant disease in pediatric and elderly populations [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . The pathogen is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA pneumovirus belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae. Many development programs for RSV vaccine are ongoing, some of them are in the preclinical stage, and 16 RSV candidate vaccines are in clinical development [71, 72] . RSV candidate vaccine developed by Novavax is currently in Phase 3 clinical trial stage. RSV vaccine development had a setback recently as Novavax Phase 3 efficacy trial for RSV F vaccine in maternal immunization did not reach its Phase 3 primary efficacy endpoint (www.novavax.com. Accessed 12 Apr 2019). 4,636 third-trimester pregnant women were enrolled in this large clinical trial. The clinical trial results demonstrated effectiveness in severe RSV cases. So far there is no approved RSV vaccine on the market yet. The development work is continuing, and more work remains to be done.\n",
            " In 2013, there were an estimated 584,000 deaths and 198 million clinical illnesses due to malaria, the majority of which is in sub-Saharan Africa. Development of malaria vaccine has been ongoing for more than 40 years. The fact that malaria is caused by parasites that makes the development of effective vaccine against malaria more difficult than the development of vaccines against bacteria and viruses [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] .\n",
            " There is no vaccine approved on the market for prevention of malaria at present time. Clinical trials for malaria vaccines are ongoing.\n",
            " Other vaccines currently under development include 15-valent and 20-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccines, HIV vaccine, TB booster vaccine, Zika vaccine, Lassa vaccine, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) vaccine, chikungunya vaccine, Nipah virus vaccine, and so on [78] . Development of mRNA vaccines has achieved significant progresses in recent years [79] .\n",
            " There are many challenges in providing adequate vaccination around the world. Firstly, vaccine hesitancy is still a problem in many countries including the USA, the UK, and also China [80] . The vaccine hesitancy does not include situations where vaccine uptake is low because of poor availability, e.g., lack of vaccine, lack of offer or access to vaccines, unacceptable travel/distances to reach immunization clinics, poor vaccine program communication, etc. Vaccine hesitancy reflects concerns about the decision to vaccinate oneself or one's children. Vaccine hesitancy and refusal, a growing trend in recent years, hinders the elimination and eradication of diseases. As of March 2019, there are multiple measles outbreaks in the USA, and parts of New York City declared emergency due to measles outbreak.\n",
            " Although concerns about vaccine safety can be linked to vaccine hesitancy, it is only one factor that may be related to hesitancy; many other factors also contribute to the issue. Vaccine hesitancy and refusal factors may include:\n",
            " • Compulsory nature of vaccines • Coincidental temporal relationships to adverse health outcomes • Unfamiliarity with vaccine-preventable diseases • Lack of trust in corporations and public health agencies In some areas, people are allowed to not participate in vaccination programs for religious reasons. In some other areas, people have limited access to education, and they do not know much about the benefits of vaccines. As a result, they refuse vaccination.\n",
            " Overall, vaccine hesitancy is a complex and rapidly changing global problem that requires ongoing monitoring. Each country and each region need to come up with specific strategies to address the issue.\n",
            " Another challenge is the resurgence of pertussis diseases. Despite the vaccination of DTP to infants and children over three decades, the occurrence of pertussis in adolescent and adult population is under recognized. Although the adolescents and adults do not have significant clinical symptoms when pertussis bacteria infect them, they can transmit the disease to infants and young children around them. Studies in European region (2019 ECDC Report on Pertussis) found that young adolescents older than 15 years old had the highest infection rate and young infants less than 6 months old had the most severe infections. The study results demonstrated that the majority of cases above the age of 30 years were unvaccinated. These data stress the need to refine vaccination strategies with the final aim of protecting infants. In the USA and many European countries, immunization of Tdap for adolescents and adults is recommended in the national immunization programs. Thus it is recommended that Tdap immunization of adolescents and adults should be\n",

            " Vaccination is one of the most efficacious medical interventions that have decreased human morbidity and mortality in all regions of the world. It not only has dramatically reduced the incidence of numerous diseases (Hilleman, 1985; Andre et al., 2008) , such as measles, diphteria, mumps, rubella, tetanus, yellow fever, pertussis, and poliomyelitis, but also eradicated the dreaded smallpox viral infection (Strassburg, 1980) . Efforts are currently also focused on developing vaccines for treatment of other diseases (Ada, 2003) . This triumph over infectious diseases has been achieved by using either killed or attenuated conventional vaccines. A conventional or prophylactic vaccination is based on deliberate exposure to non-virulent form of the pathogen to establish immunity from subsequent exposure to the virulent form of the pathogen (Lee et al., 2012) . This approach requires little knowledge of the molecular nature of the individual pathogen antigens or the immune responses they elicit. To date, this approach has undoubtedly been the most successful.\n",
            " There is, however, an ongoing trend towards emerging infectious diseases (Fauci, 2001; Fauci et al., 2005) against humankind in different parts of the world. These diseases are caused by the emergence of new pathogens, resurgence of old ones, constantly mutating pathogens, drug-resistant pathogens, and even include pathogens used as agents of bioterrorism. Previously undescribed pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bird flu (avian influenza), mad cow, and HIV/AIDS, are appearing at an increasing frequency. On the other hand, old diseases such as ebola, hanta, dengue and cholera, among others, are invading populations from which they have disappeared or cross species barrier to invade new species. Occasionally, pathogens mutate (or recombine) and then they adapt and show up as new variants that evade the host's acquired immunity. The annual influenza epidemics are generally due to genetically drifting strains of influenza that differ slightly from previous strains (Bouvier and Palese, 2008) . The development of drug-resistance pathogens, such as malaria, pneumococci, enterococci, and tuberculosis, has increased over the years, partly due to the widespread and inappropriate use of drugs (Knobler et al., 2003) . Moreover, the pathogens responsible for the emerging infectious diseases are also of potential use as bioterrorist weapon (Ryan, 2008) . For these reasons, emerging infectious diseases continue to pose threats to public health (Morens and Fauci, 2013) . Therefore, there is a need for more effective vaccines to help reduce human morbidity and mortality from emerging infectious diseases.\n",
            " The last decade has seen significant advances in new technologies for the development of new vaccines. These technologies, combined with our understanding of host response to foreign antigens, have laid the foundation for rapid advances in vaccinology. Few potential candidate approaches for this new family of vaccines (Arnon and Ben-yedidia, 2003; Minichiello, 2002; Babiuk, 1999; Nandy and Basak, 2016) are subunit vaccines, genetically engineered live vaccines, and polynucleotide (DNA or genetic) vaccines. All these new directions in vaccine development have something in common; their most important challenge is the discovery of key antigens from the array of proteins encoded by the pathogen genome that are able to elicit protective immune response against these pathogens and are effective for majority of the human population. The presence of genetic variation in the genes of the host immune system across the human population and the genomes of the pathogen variants make this a multidimensional and a combinatorial problem.\n",
            " Since 1980s, the focus of vaccine design has been on the pathogen's variable domains, mutants, multivalent coverage and not so much on conserved regions (Plotkin, 2005) . However, a large body of data is building up in the field of vaccine design and epitope prediction that points to the neglected aspect of conserved epitopes as important targets of vaccine development. In fact, evidence is accumulating that while many variable regions are highly antigenic, sufficiently large number of them are actually non-immunoprotective and have been exploited by viruses and other pathogens for immune escape and may lead to immunopathology (Haydon and Woolhouse, 1998) . Conserved epitopes were thought to be un-important due to their lack of immunogenicity (Bona et al., 1998; Li et al., 2011) . However, the immunogenicity of such conserved epitopes especially those which are immune-protective and conserved amongst many variants and mutant strains, can be boosted using adjuvants, which are chemicals or approved drug molecules. Moreover, conserved epitopes also help address the issues of ethnicity (\"pan-haplotype responsive\") compared to variable epitopes (Khan et al., 2008) . In addition, the conserved epitopes can circumvent vaccine design issues of escape mutants and the need of using the latest strains. In particular, if a set of conserved, immunogenic, and immunoprotective epitopes are suitably boosted, they will not elicit mutations in the pathogen, and thus can be reasonably predicted to remain unchanged in the next season of infection. The possibility of extended efficacy of vaccines would be a tremendous advance for the vaccine industry and will potentially serve the global population with protection against infections (Sylvester-Hvid et al., 2002; De Groot et al., 2004; Sette et al., 2001; Raman et al., 2014; .\n",
            " Vaccine informatics, a fledgling sub-field of reverse vaccinology, has the potential to develop effective vaccines . With the rapid expansion of vaccine related data (host and pathogen) stemming from both classical and high-throughput genomic/proteomic approaches, identifying conserved, robust, immunogenic, and immunoprotective epitopes manually from this large data pool is inefficient. Vaccine informatics is a practical science for designing new vaccines with a focus on bioinformatics-driven acquisition, manipulation and analysis of data related to the immune system and disease agents (Raman et al., 2014) . It provides a means for systematic study of big data, pre-screening of targets, and facilitates experimental design for validation by a small number of key experiments. The bioinformatics support can be divided into two, the standard bioinformatics support and the more specialised immunoinformatics support . The standard support includes basic bioinformatics functions, such as sequence comparison and alignment, database searching, hunting for patterns and profiles, 3D-structure analysis and modeling, and data annotation (reviewed in ). Immunoinformatics is a more targeted bioinformatics support with an emphasis on data-warehousing and mining of immunological data, such as prediction of immunogenicity (Soria-Guerra et al., 2015; . Vaccine researchers are taking advantage of these bioinformatics approaches, in combination with experimental validation, to discover and facilitate better understanding of the components of the human immunome, which then aid in the design of new vaccines. The immunome can be defined as the complete set of genes and proteins of the immune system. Highly accurate target predictions can diminish discovery cost by 10-20 folds (De Groot et al., 2002; Kast et al., 1994) .\n",
            " In the human and higher vertebrate host, the major functions of the immune system are the maintenance of homeostasis, surveillance and tolerance to self-structures, and defence followed by immunity against pathogens (Yatim and Lakkis, 2015) . The immune system is widely distributed in the body and comprises of immune organs, tissues, and cells, connected as a complex, but tightly regulated network (Jerne, 1993; NIH, 2003; Nicholson, 2016) . In general, the processes that take place at the molecular level and cellular level largely initiate and regulate the function of the immune system. A healthy immune system will discriminate 'non-self' or foreign antigenic proteins from those that are normally present ('self') in an organism and will raise appropriate responses. The number of self-structures is large, but finite; the number of non-self structures is practically infinite. In the cell, both self and non-self proteins are digested by the proteasomes into short peptide fragments, which are then bound by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to form peptide/MHC complexes and are displayed on the surface of host cells (Vigneron and Van den Eynde, 2014) . These peptides are recognition labels, which display the contents of host cells to T cells of the immune system. The presence of non-self peptides is a prerequisite for the initiation of immune responses. Peptides produced by degradation of intracellular proteins bind MHC class I molecules and are recognised by CD8 þ T cell receptor (Shastri et al., 2002; Chowell et al., 2015; Blum et al., 2013) . MHC class II molecules present peptides, produced by degradation of proteins of extracellular origin, on the surface of antigen-presenting cells to CD4 þ T cells (reviewed in Lennon-Duménil et al. (2002) ). A major function of CD8 þ T cells is to recognize and destroy cells infected by pathogens (Nicholson, 2016) . Peptides displayed by the MHC class II molecules mainly serve to regulate immune responses; they are crucial for the initiation, enhancement and suppression of immune responses.\n",
            " Driven by methods of molecular and cell biology, significant advances in the understanding of immunological processes have been made during the last two decades. This progress over the years resulted in the continuous accumulation of huge amount of immunological data obtained experimentally. This growing number of immunological data and the high complexity of the functional and structural foundation of the immune processes created a need for improved data management to enable advance data analysis. The need to manage and analyse this growing amount of complex data has led to the development of a number of immunological databases , such as SYFPEITHI and MCHPEP, IMGT and FIMM, and complex computational models (Petrovsky and Brusic, 2002) . The purpose of immunological databases is to facilitate the collection of, access to, and use of immunologically relevant data. One of the applications of the databases in immunology is for vaccine research and development by using complex computational models in combination with experimental approaches to help precise our understanding of antigen presentation and recognition by the immune system.\n",
            " The combined effort between experimental and computational immunology provided us with a new perspective to designing vaccines that will be effective across demographic boundaries. Previously, the extreme degree of polymorphism observed in the MHC posed limitations for the development of such a vaccine because the ability to trigger an effective T-cell response is partly determined by the MHC phenotype of the individual and different individuals have different MHC allele (Macdonald et al., 2001; Marrack et al., 2017) . The MHC genes are the most polymorphic of all human genes, with more than 10,000 alleles known (as of Feb 2018), and are important in increasing the range of responses that different individuals can mount. In humans, this polymorphism results from concentrated amino acid substitutions in the peptide-binding groove of human leukocyte antigen (HLA, the human MHC system) molecules that produce variability in peptide binding and presentation to T cells (MacDonald et al., 2000) . Over the years, few groups have investigated the possibility of a functional classification of HLA polymorphism based on peptide-binding specificities. It was found that majority of HLA alleles (both class I and II) could be grouped into 18 or more different 'supertypes', purely on the basis of similarities in their peptide binding specificity (Lund et al., 2004) . It has been suggested that the majority of all major human populations can be covered by only few HLA supertypes, where the different members of each supertype bind similar peptides ('promiscuous peptides') for presentation to T-cell (Sette et al., 1999) . Further, latest developments show evidence for presence of \"immunological hot-spots\" (Srinivasan et al., 2004) in antigens. Immunological hot-spots are defined as antigenic regions possessing multiple promiscuous peptides that are supertype specific. This area of research raises the prospect of identifying key pathogenic antigens that possess immunological hot-spots as best candidates for vaccine design as it will provide protection at the population level, irrespective of ethnicity.\n",
            " The humoral response involves antibodies produced by B-cells, which recognize both linear and conformational B-cell epitopes on the surface of the pathogen. Conformational neutralizing epitopes are the primary focus of various vaccine research for protective humoral responses. However, unlike linear B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes, reliable computational tools for prediction of conformational epitopes are limited (Kulkarni-Kale et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2011) .\n",
            " As for the pathogens, the last decade witnessed the rapid expansion of sequence data at our disposal, stemming from both genomic and proteomic approaches, enabling analysis to map key antigens that are potential targets for protective immune responses. The genomic sequences of a large number of pathogens that threaten public health have been completed or are impending completion. For example, the whole genome of over 7,475 viruses have been sequenced and deposited in the major public database Entrez Genome (see \"Relevant Website section\"). The data derived from the genome/proteome sequencing and related projects for a particular species of pathogen, such as West Nile Virus, is the missing gap towards the development of vaccines effective against the majority of the variants currently known within that pathogenic species and probably against novel ones that are yet to emerge (Koo et al., 2009) . Such vaccines will be much superior to the current generation of vaccines, which are solely based on a single or few antigens providing protection only against certain variants of a pathogen and therefore might elicit too narrow a breadth of response to provide protection from the remaining diverse variants of the same pathogen species (Doolan, 2003) .\n",
            " We have made significant progress in understanding the processes in the host that are involved in mounting an immune response. However, we are still far from having a good understanding of the natural complexity of the pathogens. A good starting point would be by utilizing the pathogens genomic/proteomic data to study their sequence diversity, and identify antigens containing conserved and variable immunological hot-spots. To fully realize the promise of the available datasets for such study, we would require the development of appropriate technologies for systematically converting genomic/proteomic data into protective vaccines. Recently, systematic genome-wide approach to identify the key antigens of a pathogenic species from the numerous variant sequences of the same pathogen have been reported Rizwan et al., 2017; Goodswen et al., 2014; Vivona et al., 2006; Del Tordello et al., 2016; Maria et al., 2017; Doolan, 2003; Raman et al., 2014; Koo et al., 2009; . The selected key antigens will represent the minimal representative sets of target sequences required to provide immunity against the majority of the existing variants of a particular pathogen species.\n",
            " Bioinformatics is an inter-disciplinary field that is essential for the analysis and interpretation of complex and large quantity of biological data generated by functional studies and high throughput technologies. It is used to propose the next sets of experiments and, most importantly, to derive better understanding of biological processes. As stated, the number of pathogen sequence data in public databases is increasing rapidly, however, experimental approaches to study this large data pool for the development of immune interventions are time-consuming, costly and almost impractical. Through combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches, it is possible to select key experiments and help optimize experimental design. Computer algorithms are increasingly used to speed-up the process of knowledge discovery by helping to identify critical experiments for testing hypothesis built upon the result of computational screening. A number of successful examples for application of computer models to study immunological problems have been described in . Such examples illustrate the power of computational approach to complex problems involving potentially vast datasets with potential biases, errors and discrepancies.\n",
            " Reverse vaccinology, a bottom-up genomic approach, has been successfully applied to the development of vaccines against pathogens that were previously not suited to such development (Vernikos, 2008; Rappuoli and Covacci, 2003; Rappuoli, 2001; Del Tordello et al., 2016) . The pre-requisite for this approach is the sequence data of the target pathogen, which acts as input to various bioinformatics algorithms for prediction of putative antigens that are likely to be successful vaccine targets. These candidates can then be validated by a small number of key experiments in the lab. The approach has been successfully applied to the development of universal vaccines against group B Streptococcus (Maione et al., 2005) and vaccine candidates against MenB (Pizza et al., 2000) , among others (Rappuoli and Covacci, 2003) . Reverse vaccinology is a promising method for the highthroughput discovery of candidate vaccine targets that have the potential to mirror the dynamics and antigenic diversity of the target pathogen population, which includes the diversity of the interacting partner, the immune system. However, a big challenge to this end is the need to understand how vaccine developers can cover antigenic diversity and develop a systematic approach to rationally screen pathogen data to select candidate vaccine targets that cover the diversity.\n",
            " Over the years, a number of bioinformatics pipelines have been designed that predict vaccine candidates both rapidly and efficiently. VacSol (Rizwan et al., 2017) , NERVE (Vivona et al., 2006) , and Vacceed (Goodswen et al., 2014) are examples of such pipelines for proteomes of bacterial or eukaryotic pathogens and these pipelines are highly configurable and scalable (Zaharieva et al., 2017) . They include multiple steps and integrate various algorithms for analysis and comparison. Shortlisted candidate vaccine targets are ranked for prioritization towards experimental validation. These pipelines are expected to improve the vaccine target discovery process.\n",
            " The general characteristics desired for a candidate vaccine target are (i) highly conserved; (ii) pathogen-specific; (iii) important for structure/function; (iv) immune-relevant; and (v) antigenically similar to circulating strains. Highly conserved targets are less likely to mutate and escape immune recognition. This is particularly so if they are important for structure and function, suggesting a robust historical conservation. High conservation also reduces the possibility of altered-peptide ligand (APL) effect from variant epitopes of the same pathogen species (Sloan-Lancaster and Allen, 1996; Evavold et al., 1993; Rothman, 2004) . Variants may also originate from other pathogens, in particular those that co-circulate or co-infect with the pathogen of interest and if they belong to the same family. In vaccine design, epitopes common to other pathogens could either be useful by inducing cross-protection, or detrimental by inducing altered-ligand effect. Thus, potential vaccine targets should be analyzed for specificity to the target pathogen. The definition of virus species-specific vaccine targets can be further expanded to exclude those with one amino acid mismatch to human sequences in order to avoid possibility of molecular mimicry. Antigenic mismatch between a vaccine and circulating strains has been shown to increases the risk of disease outbreak by 1000-fold compared to immunization using identical strains (Park et al., 2004) . Thus, it is important to assess the extent of antigenic identity between the candidate vaccine targets and the circulating strains.\n",
            " Typically, a generic semi-automated computational framework comprises of three key components: data collection, data processing, and data analysis (Khan, 2005 (Khan, , 2009 Khan et al., 2006 . Fig. 1 illustrates the workflow of the framework and Fig. 2 provides a non-comprehensive list of commonly used tools. Data collection would involve the user providing a set of sequences (aligned or unaligned) of the pathogen of interest for analysis. The sequences could be a single protein dataset, multiple or the complete proteome. Additionally, comparative analyses of the sequences can be performed between subtypes/groups of the pathogen. The sequences can be retrieved from public repositories, primary or specialist databases, such as the NCBI Entrez Protein database (NCBI Resource Coordinators, 2017) or Influenza Research Database (IRD) (Zhang et al., 2017) , respectively. User can also provide sequences derived from their experimental work, not available in public databases. Typically, downloaded data would comprise fulllength or partial sequences, and the corresponding metadata. Data processing would involve removal of duplicate sequences from the dataset, and for comparative analysis, the merging of the input sequences will be required prior to the alignment step. Multiple sequence alignment will be carried out using an existing tool that is robust in dealing with large sequence data, such as (Sievers et al., 2011; Katoh et al., 2017; Edgar, 2004; Do et al., 2005) Clustal Omega, MAFFT, MUSCLE or PROBCONS. The output alignment quality will be manually inspected for any errors and/or misalignments, which are common when dealing with partial sequences. Henceforth, the data would be ready for analyses, which can involve performing a diversity analysis, such as by measuring entropy values (Heiny et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2008; Koo et al., 2009) and quantifying variant motifs for each, user-defined, k-mer positions in the alignment. The results of these analyses will be plotted as an output for the user, providing a holistic view of the diversity, including variant distribution. The user can define a preferred conservation threshold for selection of highly conserved sequences. These selected sequences are then analyzed for distribution of variants in nature (Khan et al., 2008; Koo et al., 2009) , including matches to human proteins, enabling the identification of pathogen specific, highly conserved sequences. The robust nature of the historical conservation can be assessed by performing functional and structural analysis (Sprenger et al., 2008; Hung and Link, 2011; Wizemann et al., 1999; Sachdeva et al., 2005; Monterrubio-López et al., 2015; He, 2014; Tang et al., 2014; Maria et al., 2017) . The relevance of the identified potential candidate vaccine targets for use against current circulating strains can be assessed by measuring the incidence of the candidate targets in the corresponding sequences of recent strains of the virus of interest . The antigenicity/ immunogenicity of the candidate sequences are predicted to assess their immune relevance. Experimental validation includes matching the predicted epitopes with reported epitopes in public databases, such as the Immune Epitope Database (IEBD) or SYFPEITHI, or performing quantitative measurements of the pre-selected candidate peptides by generating synthetic constructs and testing for their immunogenicity, such as by use of HLA transgenic animal models that express specific HLA alleles (Rosloniec et al., 1997; Lefranc et al., 2009; Khan, 2005) .\n",
            " Bioinformatics tools can facilitate the process of epitope mapping by identifying peptides that can potentially elicit T-cell responses. Binding of epitopes to HLA antigens is highly allele-specific; core peptide-binding motifs (usually between 8-and 11mers, most often 9-mers) have been defined experimentally for a number of HLA class I and class II alleles and incorporated into computational algorithms, allowing to predict candidate HLA-binding epitopes in silico from protein sequences (Parker et al., 1994; Rammensee et al., 1999; Sturniolo et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2005; Nielsen et al., 2010; Karosiene et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013 Paul et al., , 2015a Andreatta et al., 2015; Andreatta and Nielsen, 2015; Pro et al., 2015; Trolle et al., 2015; Abelin et al., 2017; Jurtz et al., 2017; Fleri et al., 2017) . More recently, quantifiable predictive features of TCRab binding to HLA/epitope complexes have been also described (Birnbaum et al., 2014; Dash et al., 2017; Glanville et al., 2017; Gee et al., 2017) .\n",
            " Two main categories of specialized immunoinformatics tools are available for prediction of MHC binding peptidesmethods based on identifying patterns in sequences of binding peptides, and those that employ three-dimensional (3D) structures to model peptide/MHC interactions Liljeroos et al., 2015; . Pattern-based methods includes binding motifs, quantitative matrices, decision trees, artificial neural networks (ANNs), hidden Markov models (HMMs) and support vector machines (SVMs), among others. In contrast, the structure based methods are theoretically rooted and include homology modeling, docking and 3D threading techniques (Dominguez et al., 2003; De Vries et al., 2010; Agostino et al., 2016; Khan and Ranganathan, 2010; Liljeroos et al., 2015; . Although less accurate, pattern based approaches are over-represented in the literature due to higher complexity in development and longer computational time of the more accurate structure-based approaches (Ranganathan and Maria et al., 2017) , including the sheer difference in the availability of linear versus structural data.\n",
            " For a given sequence, typically all possible overlapping 9-mer (and later, 8-to 11-mer) peptide sequences are extracted. Epitope prediction for HLA class I and class II alleles are performed using benchmarked prediction models, including, for HLA class I epitopes, the artificial neural network (ANN)-trained NetMHCpan (version 4.0) Trolle et al., 2015; Jurtz et al., 2017) , and for HLA class II epitopes, NetMHCIIpan (Karosiene et al., 2013; Andreatta and Nielsen, 2015) , and the allele-specific consensus percentile ranks of all algorithms queried by the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) tools (combination of NN-align, SMM-align, and CombLib/Sturniolo) (Paul et al., 2015a,b) . Additionally, proteasome cleavage (Hakenberg et al., 2003; Nussbaum et al., 2001; Nielsen et al., 2005) and TAP binding predictions (Zhang et al., 2006; Bhasin et al., 2007; Bhasin and Raghava, 2004) will be performed for priority ranking. Several tools, such as NetCTL (Larsen et al., 2005) , integrate these various predictions into one and predict for HLA supertypes, which are groups of HLA alleles with similar peptide binding specificity. Potentially cross-reactive self epitopes may be searched within the human proteome using BLAST/BLAT alignment tools (Kent, 2002; Altschul et al., 1990) .\n",
            " Reverse vaccinology immunoinformatics approaches are widely applied for viral vaccine design, such as for influenza virus, chikungunya virus, zika virus and others (Gupta et al., 2016; María et al., 2017) , including parasites (Damfo et al., 2017) and bacteria Zahroh et al., 2016; Rappuoli, 2001) . Khan et al. developed a bioinformatics pipeline for DENV, which proved generic as it was successfully applied to several viruses, such as WNV (Koo et al., 2009) , a close relative of DENV (Khan et al., 2008) , and a number of other viruses, such as HIV-1 (Hu et al., 2013) , among others. It provides a novel and generalized approach to the formulation of peptide-based vaccines targeting a broad diversity of pathogens and applicable to the human population at large. This methodology is a significant contribution to the field of reverse vaccinology as it enables the systematic screening and analyses of pathogen data which would otherwise be impossible to carry out experimentally, due to too many pathogen sequences (high viral diversity) and variations in immune system among individuals (extensive polymorphism of HLA). This approach therefore significantly reduces the efforts and cost of experimentation, while providing for systematic screening and analyses of pathogen proteomes (Raman et al., 2014) . Khan et al. (2008) , Koo et al. (2009) and Hu et al. (2013) analyzed a large number of dengue (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV) and clade B HIV-1, sequences, respectively, retrieved from the NCBI Entrez protein database ( Table 1) . The sequences were aligned and the overlapping nonamer amino acid positions of the viral proteome, each a possible core binding domain for human leukocyte antigen molecules and T-cell receptors, were quantitatively analyzed. The mean entropy of DENV nonamer sequences was low, with a range of 0.2-1.0 for within and 1.6-2.6 for between serotypes. This was even lower for WNV, ranging from 0.2-0.5, with the highest for HIV-1 clade B subtype, 1.9-4.2. Entropy is a general measure of diversity, and the data provided a holistic overview viral diversity across the proteome. Accordingly, the incidence of variants to the most prevalent, index sequence at the aligned nonamer positions was the lowest for WNV (intra: r10%) and the highest for HIV-1 clade B (intra: B80%-99%); the variants incidence within each DENV serotype was comparable to WNV, but between serotypes (B60%-80%) was closer to HIV-1 clade B subtype. Forty-four (44) sequences (pan-DENV sequences) identical in 80% or more of all recorded DENV sequences represented 15% of the DENV polyprotein length. The proportion (34%) was much higher for WNV and at complete conservation (100% incidence). Notably, at similar incidence level (4¼ 80% incidence) to DENV, although pan-clade, B35% of the intra HIV-1 clade B proteome was highly conserved. The proportion of these conserved sequences that were immune-relevant showed an inverse relationship: DENV (59% matched 9aa or more of 45 class I and II reported epitopes), WNV (50% matched 9aa or more of 57 class I and II reported epitopes), and HIV-1 clade B (37% matched 9aa or more of 73 class I and II reported epitopes). Khan et al. (2008) highlighted that conservation analysis should go beyond the species of interest, extending to all those other species that are evolutionarily related as they may act as variants to the conserved epitopes identified. This step is necessary to identify conserved epitope sequences that are pathogen specific, with none or minimal number of variant sequences within or across other pathogen species. Variant epitopes are hypothesized to cause deleterious immune responses. Many of the conserved sequences matched nine consecutive amino acids of many (flaviviruses; family of WNV and DENV) to few (deltaviruses; genus of HIV-1) other related viruses, leaving only 17, 21 and 4 pathogen specific conserved sequences for DENV, WNV and HIV-1 clade B subtype, respectively.\n",
            " According to World Health Organization (WHO), non-infectious diseases, especially chronic diseases will lead the disability by 2020. Hence, diseases such as cancers, obesity, neurodegenerative disease addictions and others have become a recent focus of vaccine development (Barrett, 2016) . Cancer is the most common non-infectious disease that leads death world-wide. Due to the advanced technology and success of in silico methods in infectious disease vaccine design, computational approaches have been applied in study of cancer vaccine design. For example, VaccImm was developed as a bioinformatics approach to simulate peptide vaccination in cancer therapy (von Eichborn et al., 2013) . In addition, modeling approaches using computational biology, such as Sim Triplex and MetastaSim model are important to understand the molecular interactions at the cellular and molecular level (Pappalardo et al., 2013; Sankar et al., 2013) . Adekiya et al. (2017) reports a recent example of a study that included bioinformatics analysis in cancer vaccine development.\n",
            " Future vaccines will be minimalistic in approach by focusing on key parts of the pathogen, such as regions containing epitopes that cover antigenic diversity and, thus, will target immunologically similar subgroups of the human population and multiple pathogen variants. This is evident from the trend observed in evolution of vaccine strategies, which has seen a shift from whole organisms to recombinant proteins, and further towards the ultimate in minimalist vaccinology, the peptide/epitope/multiepitope based vaccines. The minimalist approach is also expected to cover the safety concerns that are associated with the traditional vaccine approach of using whole organism (Sette and Fikes, 2003; Dertzbaugh, 1998) . Vectored vaccines, suitable for 'combination immunization' that are produced by recombinant DNA technology and contain multivalent minimal antigens to protect against multiple infections, are considered to be the future of vaccinology (Kutzler and Weiner, 2008) . The future will bring increased integration of vaccine research with advances in immunology, molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, informatics, and high-throughput instrumentation, collective defined as the emerging field of \"vaccinomics\", which is hailed to be responsible for the next 'golden age' in vaccinology (Poland et al., 2008) . Awareness of the novel technological possibilities in vaccine research is also expected to grow. Future vaccinology will be based on detailed understanding of immune function, optimal stimulation of immune responses (using adjuvants) and precise mapping and rational selection of immune targets . To achieve this, vaccine development will routinely be conducted through large-scale functional studies supported by genomics, proteomics, and informatics techniques prior to clinical trials. This will provide an increased range of immune targets for vaccine design. The author expects the emergence of new generation of vaccines to be personalised to both the genetic make-up of the human population and of the disease agents. In summary, vaccinology will experience rapid progress and will eventually deliver benefits to patients from improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases.

            " about 100% [1] . Despite the presence of post-exposure prophylaxis, rabies infection resulted in approximately 59,000 deaths worldwide each year with the majority of cases in Africa and Asia. That's one person dies every 9 minutes due to rabies infection every day, 40% of whom are mostly children [2] . It causes severe economic loss in many developing countries approaching 5.5 billion dollars per year. Rabies infection is accompanied by acute encephalomyelitis that progresses rapidly to coma or death within days after the onset of symptoms [3] . Even though the international efforts to produce an effective rabies vaccine, the disease has not been eliminated as it has many animal reservoirs [4] . There is always an attempt to formulate an affordable and safe rabies vaccine via the use of inactivated rabies virus [5] . β-propiolactone (βPL) is the currently recommended inactivating agent for rabies virus, where it maintains the viral antigenicity compared to other chemicals, such as formaldehyde and phenol [6] . However, βPL is a potentially carcinogenic and expensive inactivant, thus it is important to find other inactivating agents which are safe, cheap, and available [7] .\n",
            " Although the mass production of cell culture based inactivated rabies vaccines is costly, but it is mostly used worldwide [8] . Additionally, there is always a need to improve the immune-enhancing potentials of the prepared cell culturebased rabies vaccines in developing countries via the use of adjuvants such as alum [9] . In alum adjuvanted vaccines the antigen becomes readily absorbed by the subject and more immunogenic [10] . On the other side, searching for an alternative adjuvant to alum is an essential issue in order to overcome its well-known side effects [9] . Attention has now been directed to the enhancement of immunogenicity of viral vaccines via the development of bio-adhesive delivery systems using natural constituents, such as lectins and fimbrial proteins. These bio-adhesives attach to mucosal cell surfaces through receptor-mediated mechanisms. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an example of these natural bio-adhesives which has the potential in developing an effective immune response. It was found that the combination of the antigen with either esterified HA polymers or auto-cross-linked HA polymers resulted in significant improvement in the immune response [11] . Among other immunostimulants, it was also demonstrated that bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated tuberculosis vaccine that has the potential to stimulate non-specific cross-protection against different pathogens as it improves the antigen recognition and induces rapid inflammatory response [12] . Consequently, the current study aimed to evaluate the inactivation potential of βPL, binary ethyleneimine (BEI), and H2O2. Monitoring the humoral and cellular immune response elicited post-vaccination using Staphylococcus aureus derived HA and BCG purified protein derivative (PPD) adjuvanted rabies vaccines. In addition to assessment of histopathological changes associated with the administration of these vaccines in laboratory animals.\n",
            " All procedures involving animals followed the regulations approved by the Egyptian Network of Research Ethics Committee which was created in 2008. An ethical approval for the present study protocol was granted by the Holding Company for Biological Products and Vaccines, Sera, and Drugs (VAC-SERA) ethical committee, Cairo, Egypt (approval no., 0728019157). The scarified and dead animals were decanted according to the safety and occupational health guidelines. The study sticked to the National Institute of Health (NIH) regulations regarding the animal care and the use program of laboratory animals. There are no human subjects in this study and informed consent is unapplicable.\n",
            " Five suckling mice families and 20 adult mice were used for evaluation of the safety profiles of the prepared vaccines. Five groups of 16 adult Swiss albino male mice of 4-6 weeks old (14-16 g) were used for testing the potency of each vaccine. Three groups of 120-150 g Sprague Dawley rats (10 rats/ group) were immunized according to a predetermined schedule to estimate the level of the developed immune response.\n",
            " Fixed rabies virus (FRV/K2) was kindly supplied by el-Karamany [13] (former general manager of research and development sector), the VACSERA, Egypt. Rabies virus was adapted to Vero cells (ATCC [American Type Culture Collection] CCL-81) by alternating 37 passages in mice and Vero cells (20 cycles in mice and 17 passages in Vero cells). The adapted viral strain was used to prepare the test vaccine and recorded a viral titer of 7.5 log10 MICLD50 (mouse intracerebral lethal dose 50%)/mL.\n",
            " Binary ethylene amine and hydrogen peroxide were kindly supplied from Sigma-Aldrich (Burlington, MA, USA). ethylene amine was converted into BEI using 0.2 N NaOH and finally used as 0.001 M. H2O2 was used as 0.3 M, whereas βPL was used at a final concentration of 0.0035 M.\n",
            " Rat anti-rabies immunoglobulin G (IgG) was kindly supplied from VACSERA and it was used as 6.5 IU/mL.\n",
            " Rabies vaccine was prepared using Vero cells, where exhausted growth medium was decanted from tissue culture flasks and rabies virus was inoculated at one multiplicity of infection/mL. Flasks were incubated at 37°C (Jouan, Saint-Herblain, France) for 1-1.5 hours and shaken at 15-minute intervals to ensure the even distribution of the virus on the cultured area. Maintenance medium was added to the infected flasks and cells were examined daily for detection of morphological changes using inverted microscope (Helmut Hund GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). On the third day, the infection medium was harvested and replaced with fresh medium. Medium containing cell free virus was harvested at 4-5 days interval. On the 15th-20th day, the cell associated virus was also collected through 3 cycles of freezing and thawing and cold centrifuged (Jouan). Cell pellets were decanted. The infectivity titer of the pooled viral harvests (cell free and cell associated virus) was evaluated using mice inoculation assay. Viral suspension was concentrated by the aid of hollow fiber cartridge ultra-filtration system [9] .\n",
            " The previously prepared bulk virus was divided into three aliquots. Chemical inactivants such as βPL, BEI, and H2O2 were added to each bulk at a final concentration of 0.0035 M for βPL, 0.001M for BEI, and 0.3 M for H2O2. Treated viral bulks were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours and samples were collected for evaluation of the inactivation kinetics according to the designed protocol. Samples were collected at predetermined time interval and were 10-fold serially diluted in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Each dilution (0.03 mL/ mouse) was inoculated intracerebrally in Swiss albino male mice of 15-17 g body weight (6 mice/dilution). Mice mortality was recorded for 14 days post-injection keeping in consideration that the number of deaths was recorded starting from the 5th day post-inoculation. The viral infectivity titer was determined according to Reed and Muench [14] in 1938. The presence of residual living virus was traced via intracerebrally injecting the inactivated virus in 5 suckling mice families and 20 adult mice. The vaccine was considered safe on condition that all inoculated mice remained alive for a period of 28 days post-intracerebral inoculation [6] .\n",
            " S. aureus derived HA and PPD of BCG were kindly supplied from VACSERA. PPD was routinely produced in BCG department (Tuberculin PPD RT23 \"SSI\"), batch no. A25/2020 and its release was based on certified quality control procedures. While HA was not a routine production line, but it was prepared as the research and development sector's self-activity and its purity was examined using gel electrophoresis to detected clear sole bands with an average molecular weight of about 700 kDa. Both adjuvants were mixed with the prepared vaccines at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL and incubated over night at 4°C.\n",
            " Prepared vaccine candidates were 5-fold serially diluted in phosphate buffer saline. Each dilution (0.3 mL) was intraperitoneally (IP) injected into 16 adult Swiss albino male mice of 4-6 weeks old and weighing 14-16 g. Injection was carried out at zero time and a second dose was administered on the 7th day post-prime vaccination. On the 14th day, vaccinated mice were challenged intracerebrally using 50 LD50 (lethal dose 50%) of challenge virus standard kindly supplied from rabies vaccine research unit, VACSERA. Mortality was recorded starting from the 5th to the 15th day post-challenge. ED50 (the effective dose that protects 50% of challenged mice) of test vaccines was determined according to the NIH protocol [15] .\n",
            " Three groups of 120-150 g body weight Sprague Dawley strain of albino rats (10 rats/each) were immunized via IP injection of five doses of adjuvanted test vaccines at days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Blood samples were collected from the retro orbital plexus of the vaccinated rats at predetermined time intervals and incubated at 37°C till complete coagulation. Clotted blood samples were cold centrifuged (Jouan) to separate immune sera and stored at -80°C until use. Evaluation of humoral immunity was carried out via assessment of rabies antibody level in the collected sera using home reference enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Whereas, cellular immunity was traced based on evaluation of interferhttps://www.ecevr.org/ https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2021.10.3.229 on gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin type 5 (IL-5) levels according to the manufacturer's protocols (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA) [9] .\n",
            " Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue sections was carried out to detect histopathological changes occurring in adult male rats immunized with HA, PPD, and alum adjuvanted rabies vaccines compared to unadjuvanted vaccine. At the end of the immunization schedule (10 days after last dose), rats were sacrificed. The kidney and the liver were obtained from dissected animals and washed in normal saline followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin. Specimens were obtained from each of the dissected organs and washed with tap water followed by dehydration for 30 minutes suing serially diluted ethanol (50%, 60%, 70%, 85%, and 95%). Specimens were incubated in 1:1 mixture of ethanol and xylene for 30 minutes, washed twice using xylene for 1 hour and transferred to xylene and paraffin mixture for 30 minutes. Transverse sections (5 mm) were dewaxed at 60°C, immersed in xylene for 1 hour, rehydrated using a series of ethanol (95%, 80%, 70%, and 60%) for 2 minutes, and washed using tap water. Sections were stained using hematoxylin and eosin. Slides were mounted using Entellan embedding agent, covered with coverslips, and examined using a light microscope connected to a digital camera [16] .\n",
            " All experiments were performed in three independent tests. Data were presented as the mean±standard deviation and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Student ttest. The results were considered statistically significant at probability less than 0.05.\n",
            " Data recorded revealed that βPL and H2O2 showed faster inactivation potentials compared with that of BEI. The recorded mean depletion rate of rabies virus infectivity titer was in the order of 4.3, 3.2, and 2.5 log10/hr post-treatment with βPL, H2O2, and BEI, respectively. It was clear that the inactivation potential of βPL was significantly elevated (p<0.05) compared to that of H2O2 and BEI, where the virus was completely inactivated within 2 hours. Whereas, H2O2 and BEI completely inactivated the virus within 4 and 12 hours, respectively. In the meantime, no residual living virus was detected during the observation period (28 days) post-inoculation of the inactivated virus using the tested inactivants (Fig. 1 ).\n",
            " Regarding the inactivation efficacy and related vaccine potency, it was noticed that the prepared rabies vaccines using the tested inactivants were potent according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations; ED50 >2.5 IU/mL. There was non-significant difference (p>0.05) between the recorded ED50 (4.21±0.03 IU/mL) in case of BEI inactivated vaccine compared to that of βPL (3.75±0.06 IU/mL) and H2O2 (3.64±0.15 IU/mL) inactivated vaccine candidates. \n",
            " Evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity was based on the determination of the humoral immune response (total anti-rabies IgG) using direct ELISA compared with home reference serum (6.5 IU/mL). It was noticed that anti-rabies IgG was elevated relative to time and there was non-significant difference between the antibody levels in case of immunization with un adjuvanted BEI, βPL, and H2O2 inactivated vaccines (p>0.05) during the first 14 days. While on the 21st day postvaccination, BEI and H2O2 inactivated vaccines showed significantly arising antibody levels (p<0.05) compared to that detected post-vaccination with βPL inactivated vaccine ( Fig.  2A) . Regarding the immunogenicity of adjuvanted vaccines, it was noticed that the HA adjuvanted βPL and H2O2 inactivated vaccines showed a significantly (p<0.01) elevated antirabies IgG as compared to that detected post-vaccination with PPD adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccine candidates (Fig. 2B, C) . Similarly, HA adjuvanted BEI inactivated vaccine exhibited higher antibody level compared to PPD adjuvanted BEI inactivated vaccine (Fig. 2D ).\n",
            " Concerning the cellular immune response detected postvaccination with adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccine candidates, it was noticed that IFN-γ levels showed progressive elevated values relative to time. However, there was insignificant difference (p>0.05) in IFN-γ levels in the sera of the tested groups immunized using different adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidates until the 14th day post-immunization. Further detection of IFN-γ levels revealed significant elevated IFN-γ levels in case of immunization with BEI inactivated vaccine compared to βPL and H2O2 inactivated vaccines, where they showed almost plateau shape followed by a declining phase during the 28th-35th day post-vaccination ( Fig.  3A) . On the other hand, the use of HA as an adjuvant in case of BEI and H2O2 inactivated vaccines resulted in a significant (p<0.01) elevation in IFN-γ levels compared to PPD adjuvanted one followed by unadjuvanted vaccines (Fig. 3C, D) . IL-5 showed a successive elevation post-immunization with unadjuvanted vaccines till the peak was detected between the 14th and 21st day post-vaccination with βPL, BEI, and H2O2 inactivated vaccines followed by a declining phase dur- ing the 28th and 35th day in case of immunization with H2O2 inactivated vaccine. Higher IL-5 levels were detected postimmunization with unadjuvanted βPL and BEI inactivated vaccines compared to H2O2 inactivated one (Fig. 4A) . It was also observed that IL-5 levels in HA adjuvanted vaccines either βPL or BEI inactivated were significantly (p<0.01) higher than that in case of PPD adjuvanted as well as in unadjuvanted vaccines (Fig. 4B, C) .\n",
            " Hematoxylin and eosin-stained kidney sections of male rats post-immunization with HA and PPD adjuvanted rabies inactivated vaccine candidates showed that both HA and PPD adjuvanted vaccines showed almost normal kidney architecture as indicated by the normal appearance of glomerular space and renal tubules (Fig. 5C, D) in addition to normal liver cells and nuclei (Fig. 6B, C) . However, kidney sections in rats administered alum as standard adjuvant showed infiltrated glomerular space and renal tubules as well as increase of connective tissue (Fig. 5E, F) . Moreover, portal fibrosis, vacuolated cytoplasm, and cellular infiltration were apparent in hepatic sections of rats immunized with alum adjuvanted vaccine (Fig. 6D ).\n",
            " Rabies is a fatal viral infection transmitted through the bites of rabid animals. If not prevented, rabies virus attacks the cells of the central nervous system leading to death [17] . Rabies infection is considered one of the important causes of human mortality despite the presence of effective prophylactic measures. This may be due to that the achievement of successful post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies is encountered by some problems such as the cost as well as other factors related to vaccine potency during its formulation [18] . Thus, the current study aimed to estimate the inactivation potentials of βPL, BEI, and H2O2 as the inactivation of rabies virus is considered a critical factor in the production of rabies vaccine. It was observed that the inactivation kinetics of βPL was comparable to that of H2O2, while BEI showed somewhat a delayed inactivation potential (12 hours). βPL, H2O2, and BEI recorded a mean depletion rate of rabies virus infectivity titer in the order of 4.3, 3.2, and 2.5 log10/hr, respectively till complete inactivation. Also, the potency of test vaccines was in the accepted range according to WHO recommendations (>2.5 IU/mL) and nearly similar (WHO, 1996) . That was in agreement with another study, where it reported that H2O2 showed promising inactivation kinetics of rabies virus and the potency of H2O2 inactivated rabies vaccine was acceptable compared to that of βPL inactivated one. It was also reported that H2O2 is considered safe to the environment as it is decomposed to oxygen and water thus there is no need for complicated purification processes for its removal from the vaccine [19] . Contrary to our findings, another study pointed out that although βPL is a common inactivating agent but sometimes it failed to inactivate the virus completely. On the other hand, H2O2 retains its viral inactivation potential without causing destruction of the antigenic epitopes [10] . The present study also highlighted the effectiveness of BEI to inactivate rabies virus, where it completely inactivated the virus within 12 hours and the potency of the BEI inactivated vaccine was 4.2 IU/mL. In the same context, it was reported that BEI is an effective rabies virus inactivating agent that has an advantage over βPL, where BEI is more stable, inexpensive and could be easily prepared with less handling hazards. It was also found that although both βPL and BEI inactivate the virus through alkylation of the viral genome, BEI preserved the virus structure as it passes through the viral capsid and alkylates the viral genome. On the other side, modification of the viral proteins should be kept in mind when βPL is used as inactivating agent. Not only the ability of the inactivating agent to maintain the viral antigenicity is an essential goal during the preparation of viral inactivated vaccines, but also ensuring the absence of the residual living virus is another important point that should be taken into consideration [20] . Therefore, the current study proved the ability of the tested inactivants to completely inactivate rabies virus. The immune response developed following vaccination goes hand in hand with the inactivation kinetics and safety concerns of viral vaccines. The immunogenic potential of cell culture derived rabies vaccines is commonly evaluated via determining the humoral response as indicated by measuring rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer developed postimmunization. Additionally, the detection of cytokines such as IFN-γ and interleukin-5 levels following vaccination is a respectable marker for investigating the cell mediated immune response, where during viral infection the CD4 T cells differentiate into either type 1 cytokine producing Th1 cells or type 2 cytokine producing Th2 cells. Th1 cells play an essential role in anti-viral immunity, where they secrete type 1 panel of cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α. These cells also stimulate the interaction between CD8 T cells and dendritic cells and aid B cells to release high affinity neutralizing antibodies. Whereas, Th2 cells secrete type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and promote the humoral immune response of B cells as well as the immunopathology during viral infection [21] . Concerning the effectiveness of different inactivants to enhance eliciting significant immune response, the current findings demonstrated that elevated anti-rabies IgG and IFN-γ levels were recorded post-immunization with BEI-inactivated vaccines compared to βPL and H2O2 inactivated vaccines. That was in accordance with a study which reported that most of BEI-inactivated viruses could elicit a protective immune response due to the induction of significant levels of neutralizing antibodies [20] . Another study related the level of the developed immune response to the denaturation potential of the tested inactivant on the viral epitopes, where they examined the effect of different inactivants on the epitopes of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus glycoproteins. It was demonstrated that BEI exhibited very low adverse effect on RVF epitopes, whereas βPL significantly altered seven epitopes and the least number of intact epitopes was accompanied by the highest immune response [22] . Induction of remarkable level of immune response is also critically influenced by the formulation of the vaccine, where higher amount of the released antibodies as well as longer-lasting protection could be achieved via the incorporation of an adjuvant during vaccine preparation [23] . Despite that alum is the first used adjuvant in licensed human vaccines, it has some disadvantages due to its carcinogenicity, exaggerated stimulatory effect in localized area and its inability to elicit an immune response of a weak antigen [24] . In the present study we explored the application of new adjuvants of different bacterial origins to compare their potentials to reach optimum and safe immune response against rabies infection. Regarding the recorded effectiveness of S. aureus derived adjuvants as an immunostimulant in rabies vaccine, it was reported that staphylococcus derived enterotoxin C2 could be applied as a successful adjuvant for rabies vaccine. This study demonstrated that mice immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 adjuvanted rabies vaccine exhibited elevated levels of anti-rabies IgG as well as IFN-γ and IL-4 producing cells as compared to unadjuvanted vaccine [25] . HA is a type of carbohydrate-based vehicle that attracted the attention of researchers to be studied as adjuvant and delivery system due to its immune modulating properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability as well as its low toxicity [26] .\n",
            " A study demonstrated that HA-coated nanoparticles could enhance the activation and maturation of dendritic cells. In addition to promoting the release of co-stimulatory molecules, they enhance antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, cytokines, antigen-specific IgG antibody, and the generation of memory T-cells. The use of cationic liposome-HA hybrid nanoparticles as potential vaccine delivery system for intranasal vaccination with subunit antigens was also demonstrated [27] in addition to the successful application of HA as nanocarriers in non-invasive transdermal vaccination [28] . The immune enhancing potential of HA is attributed to its ability to deliver the antigens to desired body sites [27] . It was also reported that the HA polymers reduce the antigen clearance rate which subsequently extended the contact time between the antigen and the absorbing membrane. Moreover, an effective antigen transport occurs via HA induced widening at the tight cellular junctions [11] . Similarly, it was found that the co-delivery of BCG as an adjuvant in DNA vaccines resulted in an enhancement of the immune response in terms of the released immunoglobulins as well as the cellmediated immunity [29] . Although the immune response developed post-immunization with adjuvanted vaccine is greater than that obtained in case of unadjuvanted one, the absolute safety of adjuvanted vaccines can't be guaranteed. The major problems caused by administration of adjuvanted vaccines are the occurrence of inflammation, abscess or nodules at the injection site as well as fever and hypersensitivity in addition to other consequences due to the adjuvant's toxicity to tissues or organs [30] . Thus, the present study investigated the histopathological changes developed post-immunization with the newly adjuvanted rabies vaccines (namely HA and PPD) compared to the currently used alum as a standard adjuvant as well as the unadjuvanted vaccine. The currently tested adjuvants were used at the lowest concentration (10 µg/mL) that could be applied to avoid any exaggerated inflammatory reactions induced in response to the administration of these adjuvants [31] . In coincidence with our findings, it was demonstrated that alum showed necrotic muscle fibers and granulomas at https://www.ecevr.org/ the injection site [32] . In addition, severe histological changes were observed post-administration of alum adjuvanted tetanus toxoid vaccine, where the kidney cells of the vaccinated mice showed mononuclear cellular infiltration, renal tubule vacuolation as well as congestion of peritubular capillaries [33] . On the contrary, the observed histopathological changes encountered with HA and PPD adjuvanted rabies vaccines were much lower than that in case of alum adjuvanted one. That may suggest lower adverse effects associated with the administration of these types of newly promising adjuvanted vaccines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report comparing the inactivation potentials of βPL, BEI, and H2O2 on rabies virus and demonstrating the immune potentials of HA and PPD as adjuvants in the preparation of rabies vaccine. The vaccines developed during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (especially the Chinese βPL inactivated-alum adjuvanted vaccine against COVID-19) is a strong reminder for the evolving need for developing an efficient and safe whole-virus-inactivated vaccine to target several viral antigens using different inactivating agents and adjuvants [34] . Despite that the present study was carried out on rabies virus not on coronavirus, the current findings might draw attention to BEI and H2O2 as potential immunogenic viral inactivating agents alternative to βPL. Simultaneously, exploring the efficiencies of new adjuvants (such as HA and BCG derived PPD) either for enhanced immune response or for lower adverse effects should be addressed.\n",
            " In conclusion, finally, it is worth to point out that hydrogen peroxide could be applied as rabies virus inactivating agent without adversely affecting its immunogenic potentials. Additionally, the application of HA and BCG derived PPD as adjuvants could enhance the elicited humoral as well as the cell mediated immune response with lower adverse effects. However, more intensified studies regarding the application of these bacterial derived proteins as adjuvants should be conducted in comparison to the standard adjuvants such as alum with an investigation of the cellular immune reactivity to draw a whole picture for their role as adjuvants and related pathways affecting the immune system.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Since initial discussions of technological interventions for COVID-19 in early 2020, we have had the opportunity to see technology such as exposure notifications implemented in the real world, leading to learnings about the role of technology in supporting an equitable, privacy-preserving, and successful pandemic response. One major outcome of these learnings has been a deeper understanding of the ways our technical interventions should be aligned with and in service of broader social outcomes, through partnering with existing institutions, communities, and organizations. A second major lesson is the need to ensure accessibility and transparency to the public to build trust, and determine when (and if) technological solutions are best suited for the task at hand. These insights and additional context should be applied in disentangling the recent surge of interest in COVID vaccine credentials.\n",
            " While the idea of vaccine credentials is not new, the present context introduces new and pressing concerns about potential negative effects of this technology being rushed into deployment in response to COVID. Proactive use of intentionally designed technology towards the purpose of vaccine credentialing could potentially result in a faster and safer return to work, travel, and other aspects of daily life, and thus is well worth investigating. However, any use of credentialing technology must protect individual rights and safety, and also not exacerbate the very real community-and economic-based divides that have already emerged throughout the pandemic.\n",
            " Thus, as we consider how and whether to develop this technology, it is crucial to do so in a manner aligned with a deep understanding of inherent tradeoffs and complexities. In this paper, we aim to share our thinking as researchers in this space, with a range of firsthand experience, both through involvement in early policysetting regarding exposure notifications, as well as via years of navigating many of the complexities and concerns that emerge with proposed short-term technical interventions in large-scale societal problems. Our hope is that our experience may guide others' explorations, particularly technologists; our aim is not to adjudicate whether these systems should be developed, but rather to understand possible ethical and implementation concerns, and point the way forward to a robust and effective ecosystem. For communicative clarity, the paper is structured as a deep dive into each of our proposed guiding principles.\n",
            " A successful end-to-end credentialing system allows a range of institutions to verify vaccination certificates that have been issued by a health authority, and are held by the vaccinated individual in question. Issuers are typically institutions such as hospitals, pharmacies, or other entities with the authority to administer vaccinations and accompanying documentation. The holder is the individual who holds the credential with their own vaccination information and can choose to present it for verification to an entity such as an airline or school that might be interested in confirming vaccination status. There have been several proposed paradigms for interactions between these parties.\n",
            " Currently widely adopted mechanisms to exchange claims about the end-user require issuers and verifiers of credentials to have a pre-established trust relationship (potentially through an intermediary organization). However, this is unlikely to be effective for vaccine credentials, given that they are expected to be used globally and across contexts in which pre-established trust or relevant intermediaries may not exist. For example, an issuing hospital in Japan cannot be expected to have pre-established trust relationships with all potential verifiers in the US -airports, restaurants, hotels, etc. Thus, the usage of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) has emerged as a promising technology. VCs enable cryptographic verification of the authenticity of the presented proof and can be exchanged relying on ad hoc trust established per transaction, allowing for use across contexts, jurisdictions, and timelines.\n",
            " For vaccination credentials to be used worldwide, enabling technologies and trust frameworks must have some degree of interoperability. Defining the common set of requirements for the exchange of vaccination credentials has proven to be a challenge, with various stakeholder groups defining their own requirements. In laying out the below principles, we articulate a set of further recommendations towards the architecture and sociotechnical deployment of vaccine credentials.\n",
            " There are a range of potential harms from vaccine credentials that could be precipitated by a rushed implementation, especially for groups that are already marginal-ized. It is critical that focus stays on ensuring access to vaccines and proof of vaccination to all, so that groups most at risk from COVID for health and economic reasons are not gated on willingness or ability to use a specific credential technology. It is not possible to have an equitable implementation of vaccine credentials without equitable access to vaccines.\n",
            " A clear plan for educating the public on these credentials, their scope and privacy guarantees, and the basics of their use, should be developed concurrently with the technology, rather than cobbled together post-development. A crucial piece of this could be transparency and notice mechanisms on tools that are already in use. Building functional privacy and data agency into the technology requires not just theoretical privacy guarantees, but must be combined with usability and access to technology for a deployment plan that succeeds in realizing these privacy and data agency benefits for actual users, and so must be developed in communication with the communities and groups we are aiming to include. Deep collaboration with existing civil society organizations and community groups will be needed to understand and mitigate concerns of inequality. As seen with contact tracing technology, sociotechnical systems surrounding deployment build trust with people through offline means, and are central to adoption and widespread use.\n",
            " Equity concerns include how user data may be used in a way that may deepen systemic inequalities. For example, contact tracing technology in Singapore originally promised to only use data for public health purposes, but since has been shared with and used by police. [2] In the US, an investigation revealed that the Care19 smartphone app developed for North and South Dakota's health departments was sharing user information with both Foursquare and Google, despite this violating the app's stated privacy policy. [6] One way to mitigate against such breaches of trust is to put safeguards into the design of the technology that protect against misuse and surveillance-creep.\n",
            " Looking to existing or upcoming examples of broad-based credentialing efforts will be central to determining processes for public education. The EU's Digital Green Certificate (\"Green Pass\"), for example, would use a QR-code based system to enable anyone vaccinated against Covid, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus, to travel across all 27 member states. Accessible and secure certificates for all EU citizens is a key element of the proposed regulation, [1] but there remain implementation concerns.\n",
            " Our Principle: Meaningful and user-friendly information must be provided in user-friendly form along with technology deployment, both to promote participation as well as to ensure informed choice. In addition, we must ensure 100% interoperability with low-tech and paper credential options so that privileged or tech-savvy communities do not receive disproportionate benefit. We acknowledge there will be some convenience gap, and must take care that this does not spill over into structural consequences for individuals who cannot or choose not to participate in this particular technology. We commit to paying special attention to understanding those who may not want to or be able to participate in the vaccine credentialing process.\n",
            " There are a range of ethical concerns that may arise from this technology and deployment strategy. One sensitivity involves concern that wide deployment of easyto-use vaccine credentials would make it possible to mandate vaccines. This is an incredibly politically sensitive issue, with communities across the country particularly concerned about being excluded from basic public spaces due to lack of vaccination -and by extension, lack of vaccine credentials necessary for access and equity. In the most extreme cases, we've seen extremists directly target technologists and organizations.\n",
            " These issues are likely to be exacerbated if people are not provided with agency, transparency, and education to understand the process, the technology, and the choices available to them. As has been seen repeatedly with poor notice experiences across IT services, lack of explanation hinders trust and adoption.\n",
            " By coordinating across Public Health Authorities (PHAs), the standards community, and civil rights and civil society organizations, a communication and adoption plan can be developed to increase trust, understanding of the tech's intended and safe use, and good outcomes. This is particularly important at a time when public distrust of technology and tech companies is rising, and there is already growing sentiment against government-mandated vaccines and COVID monitoring in general.\n",
            " Developing robust choices and controls for credential use and providing practical education of the of those controls and choices will increase trust and adoption. Clear communication will be crucial; individuals must be made fully aware of how their vaccine credential data may be used, whether by their own choice or legal requirement. Individuals should be able to access, maintain, and delete or replace the vaccine credential, and do so in a way that is easy to understand. Marginalized populations may not have the resources to request a physical credential if they lose access to their digital credential.\n",
            " Our principle: We believe that individuals have the right to own and manage their personal health data, and further have the right to decide where and how to store this data. Given this, we are building technology that gives people more control and access to their own personal health data. Additionally, we will not build technology intended as a mandatory vehicle for vaccine credentials. We recognize that we must maintain oversight to ensure that businesses and consumers retain the freedom to choose which credential technology, if any, to adopt, and that no data is shared without consent in this process.\n",
            " The number one priority is to build a holistic vaccine verification system that works well for all users of that system -both individual and institutional. The priority is not to build a certain type of technology to accomplish this goal. The biggest challenge to this is that there has been little to no usability testing of the technology, either involving issuers, holders, or verifiers. Major gaps exist in this space:\n",
            " 1. Cryptographically verifiable credentials are new to the verifiers, and new to credential holders, who have to manage and present the credentials for verifications.\n",
            " 2. Many VC implementations use cryptography and tech are not largely standardized. There are a range of protocols and applications, across JSON-LD, LD-proofs, RDF, BBS+, etc., that are in use and comply with the W3C standards without themselves being fully standardized. In addition, interoperation with already issued paper credentials is still a work in progress.\n",
            " 3. VCs used for verifiable vaccination records (or other clinical data) must be capable of conveying the sometimes-nuanced semantics of health records, which can include optional data elements, jurisdiction-specific codes, \"modifier elements\" and other complexities that verifiers (or intermediaries aiming to simplify the job of verifiers) must be able to process.\n",
            " There are a slew of startups in this space, and demand from customers and sales is creating uncomfortable pressure on engineers to build and deploy technology in a rushed and haphazard manner in order to be early to market. Technology supposedly built to support COVID response has consistently shown its brittleness when actually deployed, [4] often increasing burden on healthcare workers and public officials, and leading to public distrust. Avoiding this outcome must be one of our top priorities.\n",
            " It is likely that a robust, well-communicated, privacy-preserving and interoperable digital solution is the most scalable way for large-scale access to usable credentials. With appropriate safeguards and care for people, this technology can play a part in allowing a return to life and work in the next stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            " Our principle: Our primary goal is to build something that works for people and that must also follow our principles. Many top-down approaches to COVID technology have failed catastrophically when deployed in the real world, or have failed to achieve adoption as communities organize to fulfill their own needs with stable and trusted lower-tech options (such as spreadsheets and telephone calls). We are committed to working in coordination with the affected communities and involved institutions, moving carefully and thoughtfully when testing and deploying, and addressing the social, economic, and policy realities of COVID vaccinations.\n",
            " One of the major strengths of verifiable credentials is their emphasis on privacy; this is one of the clear benefits over paper certificates with no technology component, such as a QR code. The minimal amount of data is used to create the credential, which is generally a subset of the data collected and/or used to administer vaccines. Credential holders will need to understand what the privacy and security tradeoffs are, via transparency and education, as well as through education from the Public Health Authority (PHA). PHAs can both drive regulatory protections for credential holders and share that information with people, and share information about the benefits and risks of the different credential tools. Design of the technology should include user interfaces that make clear what data is being shared, and easily allow a person to share the minimal amount necessary.\n",
            " One mechanism for verification is through public-private keys -the verifier will be able to calculate whether an issuer has signed a particular document with their private key, through knowing the issuer's public key. A fundamental vulnerability is the compromise of a private key. Another potential vulnerability is that if verifiers collude, they can track a user's movements. There are several ways to address these concerns, such as pairwise identifiers. Another common distinction between types of credentials is whether Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are integrated, which allow assertions to be verified about a credential without giving all the information in a credential (for example, calculating that someone is over 21 without seeing their age). This is one extreme of a spectrum of technologies to limit how much information is exposed when showing a credential, which range from only being able to show the entire credential, being able to only show specific bits of a credential, and being able to show just a fact that can be derived from the credential. The extent to which this creates or reduces privacy concerns also depends on the use case. However, the ZKPs have not been implemented at scale yet, and the technology is thus largely untested.\n",
            " It is not enough just to verify that a credential is legitimately issued, a verifier must also know that the credential belongs to the person in front of them. The simplest way to do this is to have the person's name, and other datapoints such as an address, included in the credential, allowing the verifier to confirm their identity using traditional methods such as a photo ID. This is yet another area where depending on the use case this may be more or less ideal. For airlines and employers, revealing common attributes of a person's identity isn't a privacy concern, since the verifier is already aware of these attributes. Another challenge is that identity verification of vaccine recipients has not been performed robustly during the vaccination process in some countries, including the US and the UK. Individuals are not necessarily being asked to show personal identity documents prior to vaccination, or are being asked to fill in their names on paper-based vaccination credentials themselves.\n",
            " Our principle: There are a number of types of digital vaccine credentials and storage methods. For individuals who opt to use systems that store their vaccination data, data collected for vaccine credential purposes should be used only for that purpose, with appropriate safeguards and security. Data should not be shared without permission, and should be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed. The minimal amount of information should be collected and shared as is necessary for the intended use. (See Microsoft's Privacy Principles for more.)\n",
            " Given the many players in the space, and in the extended universe of healthcare credentialing and digital identity, vaccine credential initiatives are running up against the question of interoperability. There are multiple interoperability challenges to be addressed in order for Vaccine Credentials to work, and different groups are focusing on different areas, guided by differences in principles.\n",
            " • Interoperability of Adoption. No matter how perfectly designed a credential system is, it won't interoperate in practice unless the necessary stakeholders adopt and implement it correctly. One approach to driving adoption would be to legislate mandatory use of a specific verifiable credential, which has been suggested but has significant downsides in preserving choice, consent, and privacy. Instead, regulation of credential technology must be approached with collaboration from those who would be required to implement and use it, to avoid implementation failure and backlash. This will in practice require significant investment in education across relevant institutions, stakeholders, and user communities to ensure an understanding of and access to the technology to facilitate adoption. As of now, there also does not yet exist a plan to interoperate digital verifiable credentials with the paper vaccine proofs and certificates that are currently being handed out to vaccinated individuals. Given that hundreds of millions of individuals have already been vaccinated before verifiable digital credentials are widely available, this is a significant gap in interoperable adoption. The DIVOC initiative in India does use paper certificates with QR codes as one version of digital credentials, [3] but we currently have minimal information on the rollout success of this.\n",
            " • Interoperability of Data. Ultimately, vaccine credential holders will need to show whether they meet the requirements of being vaccinated. However, the data behind a vaccine credential must include more than a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" as the science behind vaccines progresses. Whether a person is considered vaccinated may depend on how long ago they got their vaccine, the efficacy of the vaccine they received on new variants, and other unknowns. The data standards used should align credential issuers and verifiers on the right data in the right format, which will involve close collaboration with medical professionals and public health authorities (at local, national, and international levels) to get health data right, and advocating for adoption of this standard.\n",
            " • Interoperability of Trust Framework. Once the data for a credential is established and securely packaged, it gets issued to the user, who can choose to present it to a verifier. There are a number of ways to accomplish this, each with different privacy and security features depending on the intended scope of use, and this area is being rapidly developed as groups coordinate to develop trust frameworks that include higher degrees of privacy and security applicable to a wide range of sensitive use cases. For example, it may be easier to maintain a list of trusted issuers for those issuers that are large established institutions as well as issuers with resources to spend on getting on the list, and less so for small local clinics and private practices, creating a tradeoff between two outcomes:\n",
            " i. Verifying credentials from a plurality of potential issuers may lead to exploitation of the system and false credentials being issued, which in turn could lead to credential fraud.\n",
            " ii. However, being too conservative with the trusted list could lead to smaller or less well funded clinics being left off the list, potentially increasing disparities.\n",
            " Current initiatives have different views on whether to create fully interoperable credentials and leave it to the verifier to choose to allow certain credentials for their purposes, or whether to curate a list of trusted entities that may issue credentials. Some groups have suggested that coordinating with a federal or state database of vaccinations may be the right answer to this question, but that itself can raise questions of health record centralization, as well as potential concerns for vulnerable groups -not to mention that state and federal governments have a particularly poor track record with COVID healthcare statistics. As the credential ecosystem develops it will likely move toward a trust framework that incorporates more features to safely encompass a larger scope.\n",
            " Regardless of what technical foundation is implemented short-term, it is crucial that standards are developed in partnership with other groups already building and piloting this technology, both for the sake of efficiency and robustness of rollout, as well as to build towards a stronger and more interoperable identity framework in the future. As much as possible, this technology should build on existing standards, given the timeline of standards setting and the urgency of vaccine credentialing efforts. Short-term choices made during this development process may well become part of the foundation for verifiable credential technology moving forward, and may also underpin healthcare technology more broadly.\n",
            " Our principle: Health data should be exchanged using a non-proprietary, open, and accessible standard. In the vaccine space, a number of groups are working on developing such standards, across jurisdictions and sectors. Our aim is to move forward in partnership with these organizations, while also interoperating with nondigital credentials, such as the paper certificates already being distributed to current COVID vaccine recipients in the US, and more traditional federated identity solutions. This requires us to actively build trusted relationships and collaborations across involved institutions.\n",
            " The technology and policy related to vaccine credentials are evolving quickly, with regulations and guidance being proposed and implemented by governments around the world. Small-scale deployments are likely to reveal improvements that are needed to the technology, and as systems are used we will continue to learn about how they function in the real world and affect real people. We should also expect to see our scientific understanding evolve as we learn more about covid, vaccines, and the effect of various public health interventions, including where the use of vaccine credentials has positive or negative outcomes. While we are hopeful that there is a place for vaccine credentials in public health policy to make people safer and incentivize staying up to date on vaccinations, this is still very much theoretical. Clumsy implementations of the technology may contribute to backlash or exacerbate existing disparities, leading to greater divisiveness surrounding vaccines. Vaccine credentialing also requires access to vaccines, and we should not contribute to gating services on proving vaccine use without universal vaccine access.\n",
            " We also expect a complex interplay between science, technology, and policy. As a society, we have difficult decisions to make regarding what combination of public health interventions and risk we are willing to accept. Some possibilities for return to daily life may include vaccine credentials, but on their own the use of vaccine credentials in one space (such as a workplace or event venue) cannot guarantee low covid risk in that space if there are still high rates of covid in the general population. There remain many unknowns, and we caution against overselling vaccine credentials as a public health solution before research becomes available.\n",
            " We cannot expect to plan for every problem and design the perfect system from the beginning, but should expect to continue to learn and adapt. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain oversight on all implementations of this nascent technology, listen to community feedback, and be transparent and flexible in our continued learnings as the landscape evolves. We should set up an active process for oversight from relevant stakeholders, particularly affected communities, through civil society partnerships and public transparency on our infrastructure choices and relevant policies.\n",
            " Our principle: As with all technology, vaccine credential technology is not neutral. It is often the case that short-term technology built to fulfil a specific, scoped need during a time of urgency can become foundational to the longer-term ecosystem. This requires putting in place firm boundaries surrounding the usage and implementation of vaccine credentials such that privacy is maintained, paired with the necessary oversight to address legal and ethical questions as the ecosystem evolves.\n",

            "Title: Virus-Like Particles, a Versatile Subunit Vaccine Platform\n",
            "Body Text:\n",
            " Novel vaccine development requires a balance between eliciting a potent immune response while limiting the unintentional induction of hypersensitivity and offtarget effects. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a form of subunit vaccine consisting of self-assembling shells derived from virus capsid proteins. Due to the absence of viral genomic material, VLPs are rendered non-replicative and non-infectious, enhancing their safety profi le. In comparison to other subunit vaccines, the resemblance of VLPs to their corresponding native virus provides enhanced immunogenicity and specifi city. VLP capsid proteins retain their natural structural conformation, harbouring undamaged antigenic motifs in a more immunologically relevant state than an inactivated virus vaccine. VLPs can also resemble a live attenuated virus without replicative or infectious capacity due to structural similarity and utilisation of similar processing pathways. In general, VLPs are considered significantly safer than many other virally derived vaccines by avoiding potential hazards such as attenuated virus reversion or incomplete inactivation.\n",
            " The fi rst VLP identifi ed and studied was isolated from patients infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 1968 (Bayer et al. 1968 ). Due to the ability of some viral capsid proteins to spontaneously form stable particles, many viruses produce VLPs as a natural by-product of their infection cycle. Engerix (GlaxoSmithKline) was the fi rst human VLP-based vaccine, licensed in 1989 for vaccination against HBV. Since then a number of VLP vaccines have been approved for clinical use, including Epaxal (Crucell) for Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Recombivax (Merck), Hepavax (Crucell), and many others for HBV, Gardasil (Merck), and Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline) for human papillomavirus (HPV), and Infl exal V (Crucell) for Infl uenza. Bolstered by the success of these vaccines many new VLPs are being developed, with a selection of examples summarised in Table 9 .1 . In addition, VLPs have also been produced from various non-human mammalian viruses, primarily for vaccination of livestock. Examples include porcine circovirus (Kim et al. 2002 ) , bovine rotavirus (Rodriguez-Limas et al. 2011 ), chicken anaemia virus (Noteborn et al. 1998 ; Koch et al. 1995 ) , SARS coronavirus (Liu et al. 2011 ) , Nipah virus (Walpita et al. 2011 ) , and swine vesicular stomatitis virus (Ko et al. 2005 ).\n",
            " Spontaneous polymerisation of a range of viral capsid proteins can yield VLPs with authentic geometric symmetry, usually icosahedral, spherical or rod-like in shape, depending on the source virus. VLPs can be generally categorised into groups based on their structural complexity, including single-protein non-enveloped (e.g. VLPs derived from caliciviruses (Jiang et al. 1992 ) , papillomaviruses (Kirnbauer et al. 1992 ) , and parvoviruses (Lopez de Turiso et al. 1992 ) ), multi-protein non-enveloped (e.g. VLPs derived from infectious bursal disease virus (Kibenge et al. 1999 ), poliovirus (Brautigam et al. 1993 ) , and reoviruses ) and enveloped VLPs (e.g. VLPs derived from Hantaan virus (Betenbaugh et al. 1995 ) , hepatitis C virus (Baumert et al. 1998 ) , infl uenza A (Latham and Galarza 2001 ) , and retroviruses (Yamshchikov et al. 1995 ) ) as illustrated in Fig. 9 .1 . While single-protein VLPs have a relatively simple structure, multi-protein VLPs can contain unique structural features such as several distinct capsid layers. For example, expression of various combinations of the VP2, VP4, VP6, and VP7 capsid proteins of rotavirus can produce stable VLPs with double or even triple capsid layers (Crawford et al. 1994 ; Sabara et al. 1991 ) .\n",
            " Multi-protein VLPs can also be produced from variant copies of the same protein derived from different viral strains. These mosaic VLPs effi ciently confer protection against several strains of the same virus (Buonamassa et al. 2002 ). An alternative means of increasing VLP versatility is through the incorporation of antigens from heterologous sources. Chimeric VLPs contain antigenic material from a target source supported by a stable VLP framework. These antigens can be inserted as peptides into the VLP capsid protein or substructural secondary VLP proteins, or covalently coupled to the surface of VLP. Chimeric VLPs have an extensive range of potential applications, and will be discussed later in this chapter. Enveloped VLPs consist of either a single-protein or multi-protein VLPs encapsulated in a lipid bilayer captured from the cell membrane. Co-expression of haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein M1, and ion channel protein M2 from infl uenza virus produces enveloped VLPs with the same size and morphology as native infl uenza virions, including the characteristic surface spikes HA and NA (Latham and Galarza 2001 ) . The lipid bilayer of enveloped VLPs can also support the incorporation of transmembrane anchored proteins from multiple viral strains (enveloped mosaic VLPs) or even heterologous pathogens (enveloped chimeric VLPs) (Buonaguro et al. 2001 ; Halsey et al. 2008 ; Visciano et al. 2011 ) . VLP structural complexity appears to have few limitations, with intriguing novel constructs still frequently theorised and investigated.\n",
            " VLPs are a natural by-product produced during the infection cycle of certain viruses (Bayer et al. 1968 ). The same characteristics that benefi t effi cient virus reproduction, such as spontaneously polymerising capsid proteins, also promote the Fig. 9 .1 VLP Structure. VLPs can be categorised based on characteristic structural features such as capsid protein composition, encapsulation inside a lipid bilayer envelope, and incorporation of antigens by recombinant insertion or chemical conjugation. Additional combinations other than those illustrated also exist, such as multi-protein chimeric VLPs and enveloped mosaic or chimeric VLPs formation of VLPs; however, the isolation of VLPs produced from virally infected cells is not an effi cient means of purifi cation. An expansive range of protein expression systems have been developed for a variety of applications, and can be effectively commandeered for the production and purifi cation of high quality VLPs. Recombinant expression of viral capsid proteins through tailored expression systems can also enable the production of VLPs from viruses not routinely cultured in laboratories. Common VLP expression systems include bacteria, yeast, insect cell lines, mammalian cell lines, plants, and cell-free cultures. Each expression system has its benefi ts and pitfalls as outlined in Table 9 .2 (Rebeaud and Bachmann 2012 ) . While most VLPs can be produced in multiple expression systems, the quaternary structural conformation of the capsid proteins produced can vary due to differences in post-translational modifi cations such as phosphorylation and glycosylation. This can have signifi cant effects on the immunogenicity of VLPs, as these modifi cations are often essential for eliciting the desired immune response. Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) has long been a primary laboratory workhorse bacterium, facilitating the expression and purifi cation of recombinant proteins through plasmid transformation or bacteriophage vector delivery. Expression in E. coli is often preferred when producing small proteins with limited post-translational modifi cations; however, larger proteins with post-translational modifi cations require a more complex expression system (e.g. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian cell line). The presence of endotoxins during downstream purifi cation also presents a signifi cant challenge for vaccine development from a bacterial expression system. Each VLP is unique, with optimal expression identifi ed through trial and error by comparing the translated products of multiple expression systems. For example, Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) VLPs can be optimally produced by expressing the RHDV VP60 capsid protein in Spodoptera frugiperda (SF) cells using a recombinant baculovirus vector (Young et al. 2004 (Young et al. , 2006 Peacey et al. 2007 ). Icosahedral T = 3 VLPs with a diameter of around 40 nm spontaneously form when VP60 is expressed in SF21 cells. Each VLP contains 180 copies of the VP60 capsid protein, representing a relatively simple single-protein non-enveloped VLP. These VLPs structurally resemble native RHDV virions, as illustrated in Fig. 9 .2 (Katpally et al. 2010 ; Wang et al. 2013 ) .\n",
            " Production of VLPs in transgenic plants (e.g. tobacco, potato, tomato) is a relatively new concept with interesting applications. Expression of recombinant proteins in plants is achieved through transgene insertion into the nuclear or plastid genome, or using plant viral vectors. While plant cells do not have a mammalianlike post-translational modifi cation system, plant-specifi c glycosylation can have an immunostimulatory effect. Some examples of VLPs produced in a transgenic plant system include Norwalk virus (Tacket 2007 ; Tacket et al. 2000 ) , HIV-1 (Scotti et al. 2009 ), and infl uenza virus VLPs (Medicago) . Another recently developed expression platform is the cell-free system. This usually consists of extracts from E. coli or yeast cells, and was developed primarily to enable the production of viral capsid proteins which have toxic intermediate protein forms. Development of VLPs containing unnatural amino acids (UAAs) has also been achieved using the cell-free system. The non-replenishing nature of a cell-free system renders this method highly demanding with some scalability limitations. The infl uenza vaccine Rebeaud and Bachmann ( 2012 ) Infl exal V (Herzog et al. 2009 ), and the hepatitis A vaccine Epaxal (Bovier 2008 ) (Crucell) are two commercialised VLP vaccines that consist of virosomes produced in a cell-free expression system. Following production, VLPs must be isolated from the expression system and purifi ed to suffi cient quality for downstream applications. VLPs are usually isolated through a combination of cell lysis, removal of cellular debris, VLP concentration, and selective purifi cation. Some mammalian and insect cell lines secrete VLPs into the supernatant, negating the necessity for cell lysis (Vicente et al. 2011 ). Resilient cells (e.g. bacteria, plant cells) may require more robust mechanical manipulation such as ultrasonication, compression, abrasion, repeated freeze/thawing, or enzymatic (Katpally et al. 2010 ) degradation for VLP release (Cull and McHenry 1990 ; Salazar and Asenjo 2007 ) . VLPs can be purifi ed by differential centrifugation; however, this can pose limitations on scalability. GMP production of vaccine-grade purifi ed VLPs for commercial applications often involves industrial-scale protein purifi cation methods such as sizeexclusion, ion exchange, or affi nity chromatography columns (Vicente et al. 2011 ) . Optimal solvent conditions must also be identifi ed to maintain VLP stability. Solution pH is critical, as some VLPs irreversibly denature and disassemble beyond a specifi c pH range. For example, RHDV VLPs deteriorate in an alkaline environment, with complete VLP disruption above pH 9 ( Fig. 9 .3 ). VLP solubility is another important consideration as some VLPs may aggregate at higher concentrations, forming an insoluble precipitate.\n",
            " VLPs are an incredibly versatile vaccination tool. In addition to harbouring multiple copies of immunologically recognisable antigens from their source virus, VLPs can also be used as a nanoparticulate delivery vector for heterogenous antigenic molecules. Each VLP can be considered a polymerised protein subunit vaccine, Fig. 9 .3 RHDV VLP stability at an alkaline pH. RHDV VLPs are visibly perturbed under transmission electron microscopy in an elevated solvent pH, resulting in irreversible particle disassembly supporting modifi cations such as recombinant peptide insertion and chemical conjugation of peptides, proteins, lysate, carbohydrates, and lipoproteins to form chimeric VLPs. Some VLPs can support insertion of short peptide sequences at specifi c sites in their structural capsid proteins without impairing VLP formation. For example, RHDV VP60 is known to retain its ability to spontaneously form VLPs despite recombinant insertion of peptides at the N-terminus, C-terminus, or at amino acid residue 306 (Crisci et al. 2009 ); however, these sites have restrictions on inserted peptide length and residue sequence. The N-terminus of RHDV VP60 can support an insertion of <33 amino acids (Peacey et al. 2007 ) , while other viral proteins such as polyomavirus VP1 can support insertions ranging from 9 to 120 amino acids (Eriksson et al. 2011 ; Lasickiene et al. 2012 ; Mazeike et al. 2012 ; Middelberg et al. 2011 ) . Inclusion of secondary capsid proteins, such as polyomavirus VP2, with a limited contribution to VLP stability, can support large insertions including truncated proteins (Tegerstedt et al. 2005 ) . HBV core antigen (HBcAg) has been one of the most popular VLP forming viral capsid proteins for recombinant insertion of immunogenic epitopes. Notable recombinant HBc vaccines include Malariavax, which targets Plasmodium falciparum ( P. falciparum ); the protozoan responsible for malaria (Gregson et al. 2008 ) , and a pan-infl uenza A vaccine against the infl uenza matrix protein 2 (M2e) ectodomain universally conserved between strains (Fiers et al. 2009 ). The phase I clinical trial of the recombinant infl uenza A M2e vaccine ACAM-FLU-A reported a 90 % seroconversion rate amongst participants after two vaccinations, with no severe adverse side-effects observed (Fiers et al. 2009 ).\n",
            " Recombinant non-mammalian VLPs can also be used to deliver immunogenic peptides derived from mammalian pathogens. Various plant viruses have demonstrated promise as recombinant antigen scaffolds, including alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) VLP containing epitopes from HIV-1 or rabies virus (Yusibov et al. 2002 ) , cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) VLP containing epitopes from Bacillus anthracis (Phelps et al. 2007 ) or HPV16 (Matic et al. 2011 ) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) VLP containing epitopes for P. falciparum (Turpen et al. 1995 ) . The potential applications of chimeric VLPs extend far beyond the incorporation of epitopes from mammalian pathogens. VLPs containing auto-antigens naturally present in humans have been harnessed for a variety of novel roles, such as targeting angiotensin II to combat hypertension (Ambuhl et al. 2007 ; Maurer and Bachmann 2010 ) , targeting Aβ protein to treat Alzheimer's disease (Zamora et al. 2006 ; Wiessner et al. 2011 ; Chackerian et al. 2006 ) , or interrupting cytokine signalling pathways (Spohn et al. 2008 ; Link and Bachmann 2010 ) . VLPs that stimulate an immune response against nicotine have even been investigated for their potential to break smoking addiction (Maurer et al. 2005 ; Cornuz et al. 2008 ) . The therapeutic application of VLPs can also be used to develop novel vaccines for cancer. For example, recombinant insertion of a truncated form of Her2 protein into polyomavirus VP1/VP2 VLP confers protection against Her2 positive mammary carcinoma (Tegerstedt et al. 2005 ) .\n",
            " The selected site of recombinant insertion in chimeric VLP provides an inherent limitation on vaccine applications. Recognition of native unprocessed antigen is an essential component of B cell activation in the humoral immune system leading to antibody production. Internal site insertion prevents such interactions, and restricts these sites to insertion of antigenic epitopes that utilise intracellular processing pathways. External site insertion is required for effective B cell activation and depending on the selected VLP this method of chimeric VLP design can have signifi cantly increased complexity. While internal site insertions are typically cloned onto an internal terminus of the VLP capsid protein, external site insertion requires in-depth understanding of the capsid protein quaternary structure and the interactions between each protein subunit to identify the optimal site for insertion. For example, the RHDV VP60 capsid protein is arranged with its N-terminus facing internally and C-terminus facing externally; however, the quaternary structural conformation has the C-terminus folded backwards into the central protein bulk. Amino acid 306 of RHDV VP60 capsid protein was instead identifi ed as a potential external insertion site for exposure of immunogenic peptides tailored for B cell recognition (Crisci et al. 2009 ).\n",
            " An alternative means of avoiding the limitations imposed by recombinant peptide insertion is to utilise VLPs as a particulate scaffold for chemical conjugation of antigenic molecules such as peptides, proteins, lysate, carbohydrates, and lipoproteins. Advancement in coupling chemistry continues to expand the list of viable conjugation candidates, primarily limited by their effects on the resulting particles size, solubility, and processing. Conjugation uses a chemical linker as a bridge, commonly conjugating proteins by acylation of amino groups, alkylation of sulfhydryl groups, or the activation of carboxylic acid residues. Some of the most commonly used protein coupling chemistries are illustrated in Fig. 9 .4 (Smith et al. 2013 ). Azide-alkyne click chemistry (Patel and Swartz 2011 ) and biotin-streptavidin complexes (Chackerian et al. 2008 ) are also used in VLP conjugation. Heterobifunctional crosslinkers have two reactive groups enabling effi cient protein crosslinking; however, this has the unfortunate side-reaction of non-specifi c conjugation, which can result in protein aggregation in a complex solution such as tumour lysate. Bioorthogonal crosslinkers are a specifi c alternative that enables selective conjugation, limiting side-reactions by targeting chemical motifs absent in biological systems (e.g. phosphines).\n",
            " Chemical conjugation of immunogenic peptides is a relatively simple alternative to recombinant insertion, using commercial protein crosslinkers such as Sulfo-SMCC (Thermo Fisher Scientifi c Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). Sulfo-SMCC is a heterobifunctional crosslinker which permits a stepwise conjugation process targeting the amino groups on the VLP surface (NHS-ester) and the sulfhydryl group (maleimide group) from a cysteine residue introduced at the N-terminus of a target epitope (Peacey et al. 2008 ) . Direct comparison between recombinant insertion and chemical conjugation of an H2k b -restricted peptide from lymphocytic choreomeningitis virus (LCMV) gp33 in chimeric RHDV VLP indicated that the recombinant form induced a superior in vivo cytotoxic response (Li et al. 2013 ) . Remarkably both the coupled and recombinant forms induced 20 % and 50 % tumour-free survival, respectively, following a single vaccination without adjuvant in mice grafted with Lewis' lung carcinoma tumours expressing gp33. The addition of a 4 week vaccination boost with VLP and adjuvant increased tumour-free survival to 70 % in mice vaccinated with the recombinant gp33 RHDV VLP (Li et al. 2013 ).\n",
            " Conjugation of large proteins or cell lysate onto the surface of VLPs enables the induction of an immune response without identifi cation of specifi c immunogenic peptides. Tumour lysates derived from the MART-1 expressing melanoma cell line Mel888 conjugated onto RHDV VLP provides more effi cient lysate delivery to dendritic cell antigen processing compartments and enhances MART-1-specifi c CD8+ T cell stimulation compared to lysate alone (Win et al. 2012 ) . The use of tumour lysate in VLP vaccines has potential applications for personalised anti-cancer immunotherapy. Fig. 9 .4 Chemical conjugation onto the surface of VLPs. Various molecules can be coupled onto the surface of VLPs through chemical conjugation, targeting primary amines (e.g. lysine, N-termini), thiols (e.g. cysteine), carboxylic acids (e.g. glutamic acid, aspartic acid), and phenols (e.g. tyrosine). Unnatural amino acids (UAAs) incorporated into the structure of VLPs can also be used as potential chemical conjugation targets by introducing reactive azide or alkyne groups. Adapted from Smith et al ( 2013 ) \n",
            " Although VLPs are devoid of genomic material from their source virus, they are not necessarily always empty. Many viral structural proteins have an inherent ability to bind specifi c nucleic acids, facilitating packaging of the viral genome during the infection cycle. This property is retained in some VLPs and can be appropriated for encapsulation of negatively charged molecules such as oligonucleotides and chemical polymers. The primary limitations on intraparticulate encapsulation are the VLPs internal cavity volume and the availability of positively charged amino acids (Zeltins 2013 ) . VLPs with the ability to encapsulate exogenous DNA have been explored as a possible means of gene delivery. VLPs produced from the VP1 capsid protein of the human polyomavirus John Cunningham (JC) virus are a promising candidate, with the ability to harbour DNA plasmids up to 14 kbp in length (Fang et al. 2012 ). Delivery of pEGFP-C1 plasmid into human epithelial kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and subsequent EGFP production was achieved by loading the plasmid into JC virus VLPs through osmotic shock, which disrupts the VLP structure and increases permeability (Ou et al. 1999 ) . More recently in vivo plasmid loading during expression of VP1 in E. coli was found to result in superior plasmid loading over osmotic shock or VLP reassembly, validated with JC virus VLPs encapsulating pEGFP-N3 plasmid ). This loading method was subsequently used with pUMVC1-tk plasmid containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) suicide gene. JC virus VLPs containing pUMVC1-tk were found to selectively target human colon carcinoma (COLO-320 HSR) cells grafted in nude mice, significantly reducing tumour volume following administration of ganciclovir .\n",
            " Chimeric VLPs have also been used to encapsulate DNA plasmids, enabling successful gene delivery upon cellular uptake. Recombinant insertion of the DNA binding site from HPV type 16 (HPV-16) L1 (VP60Δ-L1BS) or L2 (VP60Δ-L2BS) capsid protein onto the N-terminus of RHDV VP60 produces chimeric VLPs with the capacity to encapsulate pCMV-β in vitro through VLP reassembly. β-Galactosidase expression was identifi ed in a range of cell lines (Cos-7, R17, HuH-7, and CaCo 2 ) treated with VP60Δ-L1BS containing pCMV-β plasmid (El Mehdaoui et al. 2000 ) . It is possible that any VLP that supports internal site insertion may be capable of DNA plasmid encapsulation and delivery by incorporation of an appropriate DNA binding site. VLPs have even been used to induce the expression of their own structural capsid protein, enhancing immunogenicity by mimicking viral replication in vivo (Pichlmair et al. 2010 ) . A variety of molecules other than nucleic acids have also been successfully encapsulated into VLPs, including enzymes into Qβ VLPs (Fiedler et al. 2010 ) , polymerase into rotavirus VLPs (Boudreaux et al. 2013 ) , and fl uorophores into cucumber mosaic virus VLPs (Lu et al. 2012 ) . Recombinant insertion of a heterodimeric coiled-coil amino acid motif at the N-terminus of a capsid protein from cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) produced CCMV VLPs capable of encapsulating up to 15 EGFP proteins (Minten et al. 2009 ). Encapsulating exogenous proteins inside VLPs is an interesting concept with multiple potential therapeutic applications.\n",
            " The immune response to VLP vaccines is primarily determined by particle size, capsid structure, and innate immunity activation. Particles larger than 200 nm require transportation to the lymph nodes by peripheral antigen presenting cells (APCs) at the vaccination site (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells) (Manolova et al. 2008 ) . VLPs are usually below 200 nm, facilitating free circulation and drainage directly to lymph nodes in addition to peripheral APC transportation. Once in the lymph node, free VLPs are internalised by resident APCs. The repetitive structure of VLPs promotes effi cient uptake by APCs through mechanisms such as phagocytosis and macropinocytosis (Win et al. 2011 ; Xiang et al. 2006 ; Scheerlinck and Greenwood 2008 ) . Due to VLPs consisting of native viral capsid proteins, they often contain receptor binding motifs that also enable receptor-mediated endocytosis. An example of this is the binding of haemagglutinin in infl uenza VLPs to the sialylose receptor on the cell surface (Pan et al. 2010 ) .\n",
            " The processing of VLPs by APCs can lead to the stimulation of both the humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune system. Historically vaccines have been designed to target the initiation of humoral immunity, generating vaccine-specifi c antibodies. While this type of immune response is essential for the clearance of extracellular pathogens, establishing protection against intracellular conditions such as viral infections and cancer often requires the generation of cell-mediated immunity. The ability of VLPs to stimulate both arms of the immune system is advantageous, as the combination of immune responses often work synergistically to ensure disease clearance and the initiation of effective immunological memory. The immune response to VLPs is summarised in Fig. 9 .5 .\n",
            " Following internalisation VLPs are degraded and processed through the exogenous antigen processing pathway with immunogenic peptides loaded onto MHC class II (MHC-II) molecules for surface presentation. Processed antigens are recognised by CD4 + T helper cells, resulting in activation and release of immunostimulatory cytokines, such as Interleukin (IL) 4, IL-5, which are essential for B cell activation or IL-2 and IFNγ, which are essential for induction of cell-mediated immunity. For successful activation of the humoral immune system, B cells must also interact with native antigen through B cell receptors (BCRs). The repetitive nature of VLPs promotes crosslinking of BCRs, enhancing activation and promoting memory-cell formation. This stimulation is notably superior to soluble peptides or non-repetitive proteins (Jegerlehner et al. 2007 ; Bachmann and Jennings 2010 ) . Antibodies produced in response to VLPs can neutralise native virions to prevent active infection, and memory-cell formation promotes long-term immunity. Notable examples of licensed VLP vaccines that successfully induce high titres of longlasting neutralising antibodies include the Hepatitis B vaccine Engerix (Keating and Noble 2003 ) and the HPV vaccines Cervarix and Gardasil (Romanowski 2011 ) .\n",
            " Some VLPs are also cross-presented by APCs, primarily CD8 + dendritic cells, facilitating loading of exogenous antigen onto MHC class I (MHC-I). With additional stimulation from co-stimulatory molecules (e.g. CD40, CD80/86), MHC-I loaded with immunogenic peptides can activate CD8 + T cells to initiate a cellmediated immune response. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation is advantageous for clearance of intracellular conditions such as viral infection or cancer. For example, RHDV VLPs are processed through the receptor-recycling pathway for cross-presentation. Immunogenic peptides are loaded onto MHC-I when phagolysosomes containing degraded VLPs fuse with endosomes containing MHC-I molecules recycling from the cell surface (Win et al. 2011 ) . The endosomes return to the cell surface, displaying new MHC-peptide complexes on the cell membrane as illustrated in Fig. 9 .6 .\n",
            " The site of vaccine administration can play an important role in VLP immunogenicity. As the mucosal membranes (e.g. respiratory tract, digestive tract, urogenital tract) are a common route of infection, generation of mucosal immunity can provide early protection against pathogenic intrusion. A number of preclinical VLP vaccine trials have demonstrated that VLPs have the ability to initiate potent mucosal immunity. For example, intranasal vaccination with cholera toxin B conjugated to simian immunodefi ciency virus VLPs signifi cantly increased the (Win et al. 2011 ) . Adapted from Groothuis and Neefjes ( 2005 ) levels of antibody detected in the mucosae compared to unconjugated cholera toxin B (Kang et al. 2003 ) .\n",
            " Depending on the protein expression system used, some VLPs can contain exogenous immunogenic molecules such as bacterial RNA which promote APC activation through stimulation of pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Rebeaud and Bachmann 2012 ) . This can have an adjuvanting effect due to activation of the innate immune system; however, we have found that successful vaccination can be achieved in the absence of these adjuvanting molecules (Li et al. 2013 ) . RHDV VLPs produced in insect cell cultures do not stimulate innate cells cultured in vitro, but effectively activate the cell-mediated and humoral immune systems in vivo. Despite the success of VLP vaccination alone, the inclusion of an adjuvant can still be benefi cial in driving specifi c immune pathway activation and leading to further enhancement of immune stimulation.\n",
            " A number of adjuvants have been used in humans; these include mineral salts (e.g. aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, and aluminum hydroxy phosphates), emulsions (e.g. MF59, AS01, and AS02), and microbial derivatives (monophosphoryl lipid A and CpG) (Rappuoli et al. 2011 ) . Traditionally adjuvants were used to enhance vaccine immunogenicity by stimulating the humoral immune system to induce antibody production and isotype-switching. This was thought to be facilitated by formation of a slow-release antigen depot. Modern adjuvants are designed to directly target immune activation and to tailor vaccination to drive a specifi c immune response, enabling selective stimulation of the cell-mediated immune system. TLR agonists such as unmethylated CpG DNA can induce a potent cell-mediated response by stimulating upregulated expression of co-stimulatory molecules in innate immune cells. We have found that the addition of CpG to recombinant RHDV VLP containing the SIINFEKL peptide derived from the model antigen OVA (VLP.OTI) led to an enhancement in the generation of SIINFEKL-specifi c cytotoxic T cells (Fig. 9 .7 ) (Scullion 2012 ) . This association was also confi rmed using the Lewis' lung carcinoma model with recombinant gp33 RHDV VLP (Li et al. 2013 ). Co-delivery of vaccine adjuvants and antigens to cells through physical association or linkage leads to enhanced immunogenicity and a reduction in adjuvant-related side effects. Viruses often bind molecules that facilitate entry into host cells. RHDV VLPs retain the ability of its native virus to bind carbohydrate moieties, providing a useful mechanism for modifi cation and vaccine enhancement (Ruvoen-Clouet et al. 2000 ; McKee et al. 2012 ) . α-Galactosylceramide is a glycolipid adjuvant which was found to directly associate with RHDV VLP, forming a composite particle. α-Galactosylceramide activates natural killer-like T cells, leading to the enhancement of both the innate and acquired immune responses (Bendelac et al. 2007 ). Prophylactic vaccination with recombinant gp33. RHDV VLP and α-galactosylceramide led to the generation of gp33-specifi c T cells and enhanced protection against subcutaneous tumour challenge. The adjuvanting effect of α-galactosylceramide was increased >10-fold when delivered as a composite particle compared to the co-delivery of unassociated α-galactosylceramide and recombinant gp33.RHDV VLP (McKee et al. 2012 ).\n",
            " The primary requirements of a successful vaccine include safety, reliability, and effi cacy. Along with other subunit vaccines VLPs have an impeccable safety record, with some vaccines already approved for routine use. The absence of the viral genome renders VLPs incapable of infection or replication, preventing inadvertent reversion as has occurred with attenuated viruses. Extensive purifi cation of VLPs Fig. 9.7 The effect of CpG adjuvant on in vivo cytotoxicity. Co-administration of RHDV VLP containing the SIINFEKL peptide (VLP. OTI) with CpG signifi cantly increased % specifi c lysis of target cells loaded with SIINFEKL peptide (Scullion 2012 ) produced using protein expression systems helps to limit contamination with substances which might induce allergies or undesirable side effects. Each new VLP is extensively characterised during development, containing immunogenic epitopes in a more natural state than inactivated virus vaccines. The particulate nature of VLPs also provides some protection from degradation. VLPs are uniform in structure, providing consistency between preparations and a reliable vaccine. VLPs are readily processed by the immune system and can stimulate cytotoxic and humoral immune responses. VLPs can provide protection against their source virus, or they can harbour exogenous antigens. This unprecedented versatility in vaccine design enables the utilisation of VLP vaccines in a wide range of applications including prophylactic viral vaccines, therapeutic cancer vaccines, and even gene delivery. VLP vaccines have only begun to unveil their true potential as a versatile subunit vaccine platform.\n"

            " Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been linked with major disease outbreaks in East Asia and the Middle East. They cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndromes (MERS). The disease has been found in 2002 and 2012. At present, a novel CoV has emerged in 2019-2020 which may cause a health hazard that specified the ongoing pandemic all over the world (Rodriguez-Morales et al. 2020 ). On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the official designation for this current CoV-associated disease to be \"COVID-19.\" These newly evolved CoVs have been posing a significant threat to global public health (Wellcome 2020) .\n",
            " COVID-19 is caused by a novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) reported in 2019 (Wang et al. 2020a, b, c) . This virus has been originated from a seafood market of Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, on 12 December 2019, where a variety of wild and domestic animals are traded illegally (Dhama et al. 2014; Fehr and Perlman 2015; MacLachlan and Dubovi 2017; Ar Gouilh et al. 2018; Monchatre-Leroy et al. 2017; WHO 2003; Lu et al. 2020) . Such markets can be considered as a critical place for the origin of this novel zoonotic disease and have enormous public health significance in the event of an outbreak. Coronaviruses have been spreaded from animals to humans, it is notion that the first person infected with the disease: a group mainly seller of the seafood market, he has been in contact with animals. A much larger number of coronaviruses have been detected in animals, particularly in bats, but have not been found in humans. Phylogenetic analysis of the structural genes has shown that 2019-nCoV is closer to bat SARSrelated CoV. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have originated from bats, while other hosts might have played a possible role in this disease transmission to humans (Chan et al. 2020 ). Due to this outstanding global outbreak, the WHO declared a \"global health emergency\" on 30 January 2020.\n",
            " This virus has primarily targeted the human respiratory system. The clinical features of COVID-19 are varied, ranging from an asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction. The common clinical features include fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, headache, myalgia, fatal respiratory infections in humans, conjunctivitis, and breathlessness (Kritas et al. 2020) . Coronavirus infection has been also found in a wide variety of animals ranging from enteritis in cows and pigs and upper respiratory disease in chickens (Fehr and Perlman 2015) . Thus, they are difficult to differentiate from other respiratory infections. In severe conditions, the disease can progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.\n",
            " In the present situation, patients of COVID-19 continuously rise, and there is neither an official vaccine nor specific and effective antiviral drugs available to treat human CoV infection (Lu 2020; Sheahan et al. 2020, b; Pillaiyar et al. 2020a, b) . Most of the countries have been working on the development of novel vaccines and efforts to prevent further spreading of this novel virus by employing preventive and control approaches. The repeated emergence and global scale of transmission, a significant number of deaths, infection and mortality of care providers and healthcare workers (HCWs), and a higher risk of death in susceptible groups have been the major causes of concern.\n",
            " Several health workers, doctors, researchers, and pharmacists have been making an effort to develop potential drugs and vaccines at the national and international levels to control the severe effect of this disease outbreak (Li et al. 2020a, b, d) .\n",
            " Over the past two decades, the current emergence of COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in humans (Munster et al. 2020) . It is no coincidence that Fan et al. 2019 predicted potential SARS or MERS-like CoV outbreaks in China following pathogen transmission from bats (Fan et al. 2019) . The COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly throughout the country and subsequently to 70 other countries as the product of natural evolution; the findings are published in Nature Medicine. Due to the severity of this outbreak and the potential of spreading on an international scale, the WHO declared a \"global health emergency\" on 30 January 2020 (WHO 2020) ( Table 1) . At present, we are not in a position to effectively treat COVID-19 since neither approved vaccines nor specific antiviral drugs for treating human CoV infections are available (Lu 2020, b; Sheahan et al. 2020, b; Pillaiyar et al. 2020) . Most nations are currently making efforts to prevent further spreading of this potentially deadly virus by implementing preventive and control strategies.\n",
            " Coronaviruses have a broad spectrum of action and affect multiple organisms (Weiss and Leibowitz, 2011; Li et al. 2020a, b, c, d) . The recently emerging 2019-SARS-CoV-2 has caused havoc in China and threats to the global population. Recently, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has proposed to name it as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2).\n",
            " It is an enveloped virus particle. The diameter of the envelope is approximately 120 nm. An envelope is surrounded with club-shaped glycoproteins that gives the viruses a crown-like or coronal appearance under the electron microscope. The nucleocapsid of the virus is made up of a protein and nucleic acid; it may be helical or tubular. The protein component that covers the nucleic acid is known as a capsid. The nucleic acid of coronavirus is a single-strand positivesense RNA. The family Coronaviridae is usually considered to contain two genera, Coronavirus and Torovirus, both differ in their nucleocapsid morphology, the former being helical and the latter being tubular. Coronavirus is the main agent of gastrointestinal disease in humans, bovines (Zhang et al. 1994; Gomez et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2004) , poultry, etc. The SARS coronavirus can cause a highly communicable respiratory disease in humans (Luo et al. 2020 ).\n",
            " Next generation sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome have revealed that sequences are 88% identical to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses outbreak in 2003, more distant from SARS-CoV by 79% and MERS-CoV by 50% .\n",
            " Structural analysis suggested that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in humans; this is similar to SARS-CoV which was confirmed by Zhou et al. (2020) . The novel coronavirus 2019 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus, and family Coronaviridae. The family Coronaviridae possesses a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 26 to 32 kb in length (Su et al. 2016) . Coronaviridae is subdivided into subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, order Nidovirales, and four genera such as Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. There are four species of coronaviruses, namely HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43, which cause mild respiratory disease. The genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus originate from bats, while the Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus have evolved from birds and swine gene pools (Li et al. 2020a, b, c, d; Lai and Holmes 2001; Woo et al. 2012 ).\n",
            " Reference sequence of the genome of coronavirus was obtained from GenBank using Blastn with 2019-nCoV as a query. The open reading frames of the verified genome sequences were predicted using Geneious (version 11.1.5) and annotated using the conserved domain database. Pairwise sequence identities have also been c a l c u l a t e d u s i n g G e n e i o u s . P o t e n t i a l g e n e t i c recombination has been investigated using SimPlot software (version 3.5.1) and phylogenetic analysis (Tables 2, 3, and 4).\n",
            " Alignment of 2019-nCoV sequence with reference sequences has been done with MAFFT software (version 7.450). Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome and major coding regions have RAxML software (version 8.2.9) with 1000 bootstrap replicates, employing the general timereversible nucleotide substitution model.\n",
            " Presently, several diagnostic tests for identification of infection of coronavirus include RT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), and reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplification, and real-time RT-LAMP has been performed (Chan et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2020) . RT- The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were identified in China 3 January 2020 31 December 2019 through 3 January 2020, a total of 44 case-patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported to WHO by the national authorities in China. During this reported period, the causal agent was not identified 7 January 2020\n",
            " The causative organism was identified from throat swab samples conducted by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and was afterward named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 9 January 2020 A novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, was officially identified as the cause of an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China 12 January 2020\n",
            " China shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus to different countries for use in developing specific diagnostic kits 13 January 2020\n",
            " The The epicenter in Wuhan is quarantined comprised of an urban area spanning 1528 km 2 and exceeds 11 million residents 25 January 2020 At least 1975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019 30 January 2020\n",
            " First confirmed case of nCoV in India was diagnosed on 30 January 2020. The WHO declared the Chinese outbreak of COVID-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern posing a high risk to countries with vulnerable health systems. The emergency committee has stated that the spread of COVID-19 may be interrupted by early detection, isolation, prompt treatment, and the implementation of a robust system to trace contacts 11 February 2020\n",
            " The disease was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization ( LAMP has been used to detect MERS-CoV; it is highly specific and has a similar sensitivity to rRT-PCR (Lee et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2018 ). The China National Health Commission (CNHC) laboratory examinations established that nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab tests have become a standard assessment for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (Chu et al. 2020) . Two-/one-step quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were developed to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, allowing identifying patients earlier (Chu et al. 2020) . Later, three novel RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/ helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were developed. Among them, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (Chan et al. 2020a, b) .\n",
            " The mode of disease transmission is inhalation or contact with infected droplets. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days. Older people are more likely to develop serious illnesses because they have other diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer. The main symptom of the disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, runny nose, tiredness, and muscle ache, often with progressive difficulty in breathing (Huang et al. 2020a, b; Chen et al. 2020 ). The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. This case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is the demonstration of the virus in ✓Group I coronaviruses 229E use human aminopeptidase N as their cellular receptor ✓Mouse hepatitis virus, a group II coronavirus, uses a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family as its receptor ✓The receptor for OC43 is not known, but it may be 1 of several cell surface molecules, including 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acid and HLA-I molecule ✓The SARS coronavirus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme II as its cellular receptor ✓Structurally, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has a well-defined composition comprising 14 binding residues that directly interact with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 Primers were designed with use of OLIGO Primer Analysis Software version 6.44 on the basis of the assembled partial genome and were verified by Primer-Blast CLC Bio software version 11.0.1. Genome alignments and sequence illustrations were generated with CLCBio software Geneious (version 11.1.\n",
            " The open reading frames of the verified genome sequences were predicted using Geneious (version 11.1.5) and annotated using the Conserved Domain Database. Pairwise sequence identities were also calculated using Geneious SimPlot software (version 3.5.1) Potential genetic recombination was investigated using SimPlot software (version 3.5.1) and phylogenetic analysis MAFFT software (version 7.450) Sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV with reference sequences was done with MAFFT software (version 7.450) RAxML software (version 8.2.9) Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome and major coding regions were done with RAxML software (version 8.2.9) respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include low white blood cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; the role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors, the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality (Elsevier, Novel Coronavirus Information Center 2020). Once symptoms have developed, a person's viral load declines steadily, and they become increasingly less infectious. However, people appear to keep shedding the virus for around 2 weeks after they recover from COVID-19, both in their saliva and stools. This means that even once a person's symptoms have cleared, it may still be possible to infect other people (Jin et al. 2020 ).\n",
            " People with mild or no symptoms can have a very high viral load in their upper respiratory tracts, meaning they can shed the virus through spitting, touching their mouths or noses and then a surface, or possibly talking. The new coronavirus has also been found to persist for days on surfaces, though that does not necessarily mean these virus particles could still infect other people. That could be diminished by ultraviolet light, heat, or humidity (Liu and Liu 2019).\n",
            " Since at this time, no approved treatments to cure MERS and SARS-CoV infection (Adedeji et al. 2013; Falzarano et al. 2013; Lu et al. 2013; Dhama et al. 2020) . Prevention is critical because of the different properties of this virus that is: Presently, no successful and licensed treatment is available; first therapeutic drugs that might be effective in managing COVID-19 include remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with interferon-β, convalescent plasma, and mAbs (Li et al. 2020a, b, c, d) .\n",
            " However, a number of researchers are working in multiple centers to control the outbreak of disease. Controlled clinical trial is currently in progress to assess the efficacy and safety of patients infected with COVID-19. Initial treatment of fever includes antipyretic drugs such as paracetamol, while expectorants such as guaifenesin may be used for a dry cough (Wang et al. 2020a, b, c) . Severe conditions such as acute respiratory infection, respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or shock require the administration of immediate oxygen therapy. This should be at 5 L/min to reach SpO2 targets of ≥ 90% in nonpregnant adults and children and ≥ 92-95% in pregnant women (Rosjo et al. 2011; WHO 2013 , WHO 2014 .\n",
            " In the absence of shock, intravenous solutions should be carefully administered (Schultz et al. 2017) . Renal replacement therapy (RRT) must be given for patients with an acute kidney injury (Wang et al. 2020a, b, c) . If a patient can develop a fungal and bacterial infection, antibiotic therapy should be given within 1 h, for assessment for sepsis (Rhodes et al. 2016) . Therefore, conventional and balanced antibiotic treatment must still be followed (Kui et al. 2020) .\n",
            " Various drugs such as IFN-α and lopinavir/ritonavir; oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor; and glucocorticoids have been recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. These drugs have enhanced the immunity of COVID-19-infected patients (Chu 2004) . In children, methylprednisolone should be limited to 1-2 mg/kg/day for a maximum of 5 days (Wang et al. 2020a, b, c; Kui et al. 2020) . Furthermore, the chloroquine phosphate function might be effective in increasing endosome pH and preventing virus fusion in the host cell (Gao et al. 2020) . Recently, the blocking of the virus attachment to ACE-2 receptors and the employment of convalescent plasma therapy seem to be useful in treatment \n",
            " According to the data from August 2020, about 165 vaccines are in development and process and 28 vaccines have reached the stage of human trials. The development and testing of vaccines need many years of research before reaching the clinic and market. Several scientists are continuously working day by day and racing to produce a safe and effective vaccine for controlling the outbreak of coronavirus by the next year. This work began in January with the interpreting of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The first vaccine safety trials on humans have been started in March, but their results are in doubt. Several trials are failing, and other trials may stop without a clear result. A few may succeed in stimulating the immune system to produce effective antibodies against the virus. All vaccine development processes start through preclinical trial including phase I, phase II, and phase III; approval; and combined phases. Scientists give the vaccine to animals such as mice or monkeys in the preclinical test. The preclinical phase includes 3 phases. In phase I trial, scientists give the vaccine to a small number of people to test safety and dosage as well as to confirm that it stimulates the immune system. In phase II trial, scientists give the vaccine to hundreds of people split into groups, such as children and the elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. These trials further test the vaccine's safety and ability to stimulate the immune system. In phase III trial, scientists give the vaccine to thousands of people and wait to see how many become infected, compared with volunteers who received a placebo. These trials can determine the vaccine protects against the coronavirus. In June, the FDA said that a coronavirus vaccine would have to protect at least 50% of vaccinated people to be considered effective. The last approval regulators in each country have reviewed the trial results and decide whether to approve the vaccine or not. During a pandemic, a vaccine may receive emergency use authorization before getting formal approval. Another way to accelerate vaccine development is to combine the phases. Some coronavirus vaccines are now in phase I/II trials, for example, in which they are tested for the first time on hundreds of people ( Fig. 1) .\n",
            " At present, various companies have been continuously developing vaccines and reaching for trials on humans, along with a selection of promising vaccines still being tested in cells or animals.\n",
            " Moderna develops vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce viral proteins in the body. They have yet to bring one to the market. In partnership with National Institutes of Health, they found that the vaccine protects monkeys from the coronavirus. In March, the company put the first COVID-19 vaccine into human trials, which yielded promising results; after carrying out phase II study, they launched a phase III trial on 27 July 2020. The final trial will enroll 30,000 healthy people at about 89 sites around the USA. The government has bankrolled Moderna's efforts with nearly $1 billion in support.\n",
            " The German company BioNTech has entered into collaborations with Pfizer, based in New York, and the Chinese drugmaker Fosun Pharma to develop their mRNA-based vaccine. In July, they posted preliminary results from their phase I/II trials in the USA and Germany. They found that the volunteers produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, as well as immune cells called T cells that respond to the virus. Some volunteers experienced moderate side effects such as sleep disturbances and sore arms. On 27 July 2020, they announced to launch phase II/III trial with 30,000 volunteers in the USA and other countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Germany.\n",
            " The Trump US administration awarded a $1.9 billion contract for 100 million doses to be delivered by December 2020 and the option to acquire 500 million more doses. Meanwhile, Japan made a deal for 120 million doses. If approved, Pfizer said they expect to manufacture over 1.3 billion doses of their vaccine worldwide by the end of 2021.\n",
            " Imperial College London researchers have developed a \"self-amplifying\" RNA vaccine, which boosts the production of a viral protein to stimulate the immune system. They began phase I/II trials on June 15 and have partnered with Morningside Ventures to manufacture and distribute the vaccine through a new company called VacEquity Global Health. The researchers expect to know if the vaccine is effective by the end of the year.\n",
            " Indian vaccine-maker Zydus Cadila has created a DNAbased vaccine. On July 3, they announced the approval to start human trials, becoming the second company in India to enter the COVID-19 vaccine race after Bharat Biotech. After a successful phase I trial, they entered phase II on August 6.\n",
            " On June 30, the Japanese biotechnology company AnGes announced they had started safety trials on a DNA-based vaccine and developed in partnership with Osaka University and Takara Bio.\n",
            " The California-based company Arcturus Therapeutics and Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore have developed an mRNA vaccine. The \"self-replicating\" design of the molecules in the vaccine led to strong immune responses in animal experiments. On July 21, Singapore approved their application for a phase I/II trial in humans.\n",
            " On 30 June 2020, the American company Inovio announced they had interim phase I data on their DNA-based vaccine. They found no serious adverse effects and measured an immune response in 34 out of 36 volunteers. They plan to start phase II/III trials.\n",
            " In March 2020, the Trump administration unsuccessfully tried to entice CureVac to move its research from Germany to the USA. In June 2020, the company launched phase I trials of its mRNA vaccine. The company said its German facility can make hundreds of millions of vaccine doses a year.\n",
            " The Korean company Genexine started testing the safety of a DNA-based vaccine in June 2020. They anticipate moving to phase II trials in the fall.\n",
            " In June 2020, Chinese researchers at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Suzhou Abogen Biosciences, and Walvax Biotechnology announced they would start their country's first safety trials on an mRNA-based vaccine, called ARCoV. Earlier studies on monkeys reportedly showed protective effects.\n",

            " A vaccine in development by the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1. A study on monkeys found that the vaccine provided them protection. In May, the USA awarded the project $1.2 billion in support. Their phase I/II trial reported that the vaccine was safe, causing no severe side effects. It raised antibodies against the coronavirus as well as other immune defenses. The vaccine is now in phase II/III Fig. 1 Stages of vaccine testing process trials in England and India, as well as phase III trials in Brazil and South Africa. The project may deliver emergency vaccines by October. AstraZeneca has said their total manufacturing capacity for the vaccine, if approved, stands at two billion doses. India's Serum Institute has already produced millions of doses to be used in trials.\n",
            " The Chinese company CanSino Biologics developed a vaccine based on an adenovirus called Ad5, in partnership with the Institute of Biology at the country's Academy of Military Medical Sciences. In May, they published promising results from a phase I safety trial, and in July, they reported that their phase II trials demonstrated the vaccine produced a strong immune response. In an unprecedented move, the Chinese military approved the vaccine on June 25 for a year as a \"specially needed drug.\" CanSino would not say whether vaccination would be mandatory or optional for soldiers.\n",
            " Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston developed a method for making vaccines out of a virus called Adenovirus 26, or Ad26 for short. Johnson & Johnson developed vaccines for Ebola and other diseases with Ad26 and now made one vaccine for the coronavirus. In March, they received $456 million from the US government to support their move towards production. The vaccine has provided protection in experiments on monkeys. Johnson & Johnson launched phase I/II trials in July and planning for phase III trials in September. In August, the federal government agreed to pay $1 billion for 100 million doses if the vaccine is approved. The company is aiming for a production of at least a billion doses in 2021.\n",
            " Gamaleya Research Institute, part of Russia's Ministry of Health, launched a phase I trial in June of a vaccine they call Gam-COVID-Vac-Lyo. It is a combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and Ad26, both engineered with a coronavirus gene. In July, the chair of the upper house of Russia's Parliament announced the country may start vaccine production by the end of the year.\n",
            " The Swiss company Novartis will manufacture a vaccine based on a gene therapy treatment developed by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Hospital. A virus called an adeno-associated virus delivers coronavirus gene fragments into cells. Phase I trials are set to begin in late 2020.\n",
            " The American company Merck announced in May it would develop a vaccine from vesicular stomatitis viruses, the same approach it successfully used to produce the first approved vaccine for Ebola. The company is partnering with IAVI and has received $38 million in support from the US government. Unlike most other vaccines, this one could be taken orally.\n",
            " After acquiring the Austrian firm Themis Bioscience in June, Merck developed a second vaccine. It uses a weakened measles virus to carry genetic material into patients' cells. Merck says it will start clinical trials in the third quarter of 2020.\n",
            " Vaxart's vaccine is an oral tablet containing an adenovirus that delivers coronavirus genes. They are preparing for phase I trials.\n",
            " Protein-based vaccines use a coronavirus protein or a protein fragment to provoke an immune response.\n",
            " In July, the Chinese company Anhui Zhifei Longcom began phase II trials for a vaccine that is a combination of viral proteins and an adjuvant that stimulates the immune system. The company is part of Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products and has partnered with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.\n",
            " Maryland-based Novavax has developed a way to stick proteins onto microscopic particles. They have created vaccines for a number of different diseases using this platform; their flu vaccine finished phase III trials in March. The company launched trials for a COVID-19 vaccine in May, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has invested $384 million in the vaccine. In July, the US government awarded $1.6 billion to support the vaccine's clinical trials and manufacturing. If the trials succeed, Novavax expects to deliver 100 million doses for use in the USA by the first quarter of 2021. Plants in Europe and Asia would be able to satisfy more of the world's demand. On August 4, Novavax announced promising results from two preliminary studies in monkeys and humans.\n",
            " Clover Biopharmaceuticals has developed a vaccine containing a protein from coronaviruses. The main objective of this vaccine is to stimulate the immune system. The vaccine is being given in conjunction with the so-called adjuvants made by British drugmaker GSK and the American company Dynavax. Investments from CEPI will support the development of manufacturing that could lead to the production of hundreds of millions of doses a year.\n",
            " The Australian company Vaxine developed a vaccine that combines viral proteins with an adjuvant that stimulates the immune system. They successfully completed phase I trials in July and expect to start phase II trials in September.\n",
            " Canada-based Medicago, partly funded by the cigarette maker Philip Morris, uses a species of tobacco to make vaccines. They deliver virus genes into leaves and the plant cells then create protein shells that mimic viruses. In July, Medicago launched phase I trials on a plant-based COVID-19 vaccine in combination with adjuvants from drug makers GSK and Dynavax. If the trial goes well, they plan to start phase II/III trials in October.\n",
            " A vaccine from Australia's University of Queensland delivers viral proteins altered to draw a stronger immune response. The university launched phase I trials in July, combining the proteins with an adjuvant made by CSL. If the results are positive, CSL will advance late-stage clinical trials and expects to make tens of millions of doses.\n",
            " A second tobacco-based vaccine is in development at Kentucky BioProcessing, an American subsidiary of British American Tobacco, the maker of Lucky Strike and other cigarettes. Like Medicago, Kentucky BioProcessing engineers a species of tobacco called Nicotiana benthamiana to make viral proteins. The company previously used this technique to make a drug called ZMapp for Ebola. After preclinical testing in the spring, they registered a phase I trial for their coronavirus vaccine in July.\n",
            " Taiwan-based vaccine-maker Medigen is making a vaccine made of a combination of spike proteins and an adjuvant from Dynavax. They have registered a phase I trial set to start in September.\n",
            " After the SARS epidemic in 2002, Baylor College of Medicine researchers began developing a vaccine that could prevent a new outbreak. SARS and COVID-19 are very similar, and the researchers are reviving the project in partnership with the Texas Children's Hospital.\n",
            " A vaccine in development by the University of Pittsburgh, called PittCoVacc, is a skin patch tipped with 400 tiny needles made of sugar. When placed on the skin, the needles dissolve and deliver virus proteins into the body.\n",
            " In addition to their mRNA vaccine, Sanofi is developing a vaccine that is based on viral proteins. They are producing the proteins with engineered viruses that grow inside insect cells. GSK will supplement these proteins with adjuvants that stimulate the immune system. The companies expect to enter clinical trials in September. In July, they reached two major agreements for supplying the vaccine next year. They reached an agreement with the British government to provide up to 60 million doses if the vaccine succeeds in trials. Meanwhile, the USA will give the companies $2.1 billion for 100 million doses. Sanofi has said it could potentially produce at least 600 million doses a year.\n",
            " Inactivated virus vaccine has been safe and provoked an immune response; the state-owned Chinese company Sinopharm launched phase III trials in July in the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi's health minister has the first volunteer to be injected, and 15,000 people participated. In July, the chairman of Sinopharm told Chinese state media that the vaccine could be ready for public use by the end of the year.\n",
            " The private Chinese company Sinovac Biotech is testing an inactivated vaccine called CoronaVac. In June, the company announced phase I/II trials on 743 volunteers and found no severe adverse effects and produced an immune response. Sinovac then launched a phase III trial in Brazil in July.

            " On July 18, North Korea's State Commission of Science and Technology announced on their website that they had started clinical trials on a vaccine based on part of the coronavirus spike protein. It is hard to independently determine how much truth there is in the claim from the isolated dictatorship.\n",
            " The commission claimed to have tested the vaccine on animals but provided no data. What's more, it stated that effectiveness trials would have to be carried out in another country \"since there is no case of Covid-19 in DPR Korea.\" That is a claim outside experts find highly doubtful.\n",
            " The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine has been developed in the early 1900s as a protection against tuberculosis. The Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia is conducting a phase III trial, and several other trials are underway to see if the vaccine partly protects against the coronavirus.\n",
            " As of August 1, TASS Russian News Agency reported that human trials of the Gam-COVID-Vac-Lyo the vaccine candidate from the Gamaleya Scientific Research Institute are now complete.

            " TASS reports that the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) Kirill Dmitriev said the people who were injected with Gam-COVID-Vac-Lyo have developed immunity on the 21st day after receiving the first dose. He said that their immunity has doubled after they received the second injection.\n",
            " There are currently more than 50 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in trials. The World Health Organization is working in collaboration with scientists, businesses, and global health organizations through the ACT accelerator to speed up the pandemic response. When a safe and effective vaccine is found, COVAX (led by WHO, GAVI, and CEPI) will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of these vaccines to protect people of countries. People most at risk will be prioritized. While we work towards rolling out a safe and effective vaccine fairly, we must continue the essential public health actions to suppress transmission and reduce mortality.\n",
            " According to the WHO report on 18 December 2020, the FDA has formally authorized Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for use in adults. Moderna expects to begin shipping 5.9 million doses of the vaccine across the USA within days. More than 150 coronavirus vaccines are in development across the world, and hopes are high to bring one to market in record time to ease the global crisis. Several efforts are underway to help make that possible, including the US government's Operation Warp Speed initiative, which has pledged $10 billion and aims to develop and deliver 300 million doses of a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine by January 2021. The World Health Organization is also coordinating global efforts to develop a vaccine, with an eye towards delivering two billion doses by the end of 2021.\n",
            " The World Health Organization is one of the leaders of a global union known as COVAX; the vaccine is the pillar of the ACT-Accelerator collaboration that is working to accelerate the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and ensure that their use is equitable and able to access by different pharmaceutical industries of various regions.\n",
            " COVAX will allocate vaccines across countries according to a framework developed by a group that includes ethicists, scientists, and other health experts and vetted by WHO's Member States. Under this framework, COVID-19 vaccines will be rolled out in two phases. In the first phase, they will be allocated according to population size to all participating countries at the same time, so as to provide enough vaccine to protect those people at greatest risk of infection and of severe disease along with health workers at risk of transmission. In the second phase of the rollout, as more doses are produced, vaccines should go to groups less at risk of being infected or of suffering badly. COVAX aims to provide at least 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021. Although that is not enough for everyone, it may be enough to end the acute stage of the crisis and put the world on the road to ending the pandemic (Table 5) .\n",
            " Operation Warp Speed is a collaboration of several US government departments including Health and Human Services (HHS) and subagencies; Defense, Agriculture, Energy and Veterans Affairs; and the private sector.

            " The recent COVID-19 outbreak has been considered as a global health emergency. At the global level, the number of positive cases has continued to rise and is currently placed at 75,110,651 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with over 1,680,395 deaths (WHO 2020). This new virus outbreak has challenged the economic, medical, and public health infrastructure of several countries. Old age and immunity weaker patients are at the greatest risk of fatality. The rapid spread of the disease needs isolation protocols to prevent further transmission. There is no confirmed medication or vaccine that has been available to control the severe effect of the disease. Most of the researchers, doctors, government institutes and labs, and organizations have been continuously working on the development of a novel drug to control the outbreak.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Since its emergence in December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and became a pandemic of international concern. COVID-19 has induced an unprecedented global burden on health and economy. As of 29 November 2020, it has led to greater than 1.4 million deaths in 220 countries or territories [1] . While it appears that the whole world is looking forward to the arrival of a safe and effective vaccine, the acceptance for COVID-19 vaccine by general public remains uncertain [2] .\n",
            " Thus far, at least 48 vaccines are in clinical evaluation [3] . COVID-19 vaccines in the pipe line can be divided into two categories. The newer or genetic vaccines include messenger RNA, DNA and non-replicating viral vectors, which are running faster in their speed in clinical evaluation. There are currently three vaccines showing promise in their efficacy in late-stage clinical trials [4] , with two using the newer mRNA technology. However, vaccines from such ''newer\" platforms have not been approved for large-scale human use, putting future vaccination campaign at risk of ''vaccine hesitancy\" [5] . Facing the huge demand in vaccine doses, manufacturers who had not been engaged in vaccine production are now involved. Furthermore, the Governments have been criticised as being limited in capacity for global health security and too slow in response to pandemic. A worldwide decline in public trust in immunisation and the rise of vaccine hesitancy may further impact on vaccine uptake [6, 7] .\n",
            " It has been estimated that an uptake of 55-82% is required to achieve herd immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [8] . Therefore, identifying factors associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine is urgently needed to formulate contextual-specific education and policy implementation. The Health Belief Model (HBM) has been adopted as a conceptual framework that was extensively evaluated empirically [9] . It empowers researchers to explain and predict health promoting behaviour in terms of patterns of belief by addressing the association between health behaviours and health services utilisation [10] . The HBM has previously been used to evaluate beliefs and attitudes toward seasonal influenza and pandemic swine flu vaccines [11, 12] , as well as the relationship between perceptions and self-paid hepatitis B vaccination [13] . Nevertheless, few studies have examined the various constructs of the HBM that could predict the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, although there are studies that have examined the acceptance of and willingness to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine in the Asia Pacific region [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition, recent studies showed that trust in the healthcare system and vaccine manufacturing is a crucial component of health education programmes that target to promote life-saving vaccines [18] . Regular assessment and surveillance of trust levels with a focus on deliberate initiatives to establish trust in immunisation programmes represent important steps to narrowing vaccine confidence gaps [18] .\n",
            " The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in the general population of Hong Kong, and examined the factors independently associated with willingness. In particular, we hypothesised that the HBM constructs and level of trust towards the healthcare system and/or vaccine manufacturers are significantly associated with the acceptance of an individual to COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
            " We adopted a methodology similar to a previous populationbased, random telephone survey conducted in Hong Kong [19] . All Chinese individuals aged ! 18 years who could communicate in Chinese are eligible to participate. Telephone numbers were first selected randomly from an updated directory as seed numbers to minimise sampling error. The updated directory was composed according to an online website which documented the landline telephone numbers from Hong Kong residents in 2018 by a telephone company, which covers all the Hong Kong telephone landlines. Another three set of numbers were then generated through randomisation of the last 2 digitals in order to recruit the unlisted numbers. Duplicate numbers were screened out, with the remaining numbers mixed in a random order to form the final sample. The selection of the sample population was conducted by the Centre for Health Behaviours Research of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Since a minority of family households had more than one fixed telephone line, participants were asked if they have already been recruited to avoid double counting. If there was no response in the initial telephone call, at least three attempts in separate occasions were given. All telephone calls to each household for non-respondents were separated by at least one day. If the target subject was available but busy to complete interview, a mutually convenient time was scheduled to administer the survey. According to standard methodology, only one subject was recruited from each household to avoid clustering effect within household. Upon successful contact with a target household, one qualified household member was selected using the last birthday random selection method (i.e. a respondent aged ! 18 years in a household who just had his/her birthday was selected to participate), which has been used in a previous territory-wide telephone survey in Hong Kong [20] . Non-response was defined as non-completion of the survey after three telephone attempts. Non-respondents were replaced by the next household telephone number. Interviews were carried out between 17:00 and 22:00 on weekdays and other periods including weekends and public holidays should appointments with suitable subjects were arranged. The interviewed subjects were briefed about the study purpose, assured of the confidentiality, and requested to provide informed consent. The centre trained a team of interviewers on the administration of telephone interviews by experienced epidemiologists, and interviews were performed using a fieldwork manual highlighting standard operation procedure. An experienced project coordinator supervised the research team throughout the study, and was responsible for administering quality assurance for the telephone interviews. The telephone interviews were performed from 27 July to 27 August 2020 when Hong Kong faced the peak of the third wave of COVID-19. At that time, social distancing measures were escalated including work from home, limiting public gatherings to two people, banning restaurant eating-in, and reinforcing compulsory wearing of face masks in public places [21] . Assuming the proportion of COVID vaccine acceptance as 50%, a minimum of 1111 subjects were required to achieve a precision level of 3% from the formula: ''[precision = 1. \n",
            " A questionnaire based on the HBM previously designed and developed by a panel of epidemiologists, psychologists, and clinicians was used (Supplementary Document) [19] . Acceptance in this study was defined as the action of consenting to receive or undertake the CVOID-19 vaccine. It was assessed by the responses to the question: ''If the Government will provide a free-of-charge COVID-19 vaccine within the next 12 months, will you receive it?\" with response options ''yes\", ''no\", or ''not sure\". The survey consisted of four sections including (1) sociodemographic details (age, gender, marital status, educational level, job status, household income, utilisation of social security allowance); (2) self-reported health status (measured by the presence of chronic conditions and the self-report health-related quality of life [HRQoL]); (3) perception, attitude and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, and (4) trust towards the healthcare system, new vaccine platforms and manufacturers. The variables pertinent to the HBM about the COVID-19 vaccine were used, including perceived susceptibility (which was defined as the subjective assessment of the risk of contracting COVID-19 measured by 3 items); perceived severity (severity and consequences of having COVID-19 by 4 items); perceived benefits (value or efficacy of receiving COVID-19 vaccine by 4 items), perceived barriers (obstacles to receive COVID-19 vaccine by 4 items); and clues to actions (triggers for receiving COVD-19 vaccination by 4 items, including recommendations by the Government, physicians, family members and friends, respectively). Two scales were used to measure trust in the survey [18, 22] . The first scale assessed the degree of trust of an individual towards the healthcare system (3 items). This scale reflects overall beliefs about one's willingness to be placed into the healthcare system in general. Trust in manufacturers was measured via a modified 4-item scale developed and validated by Hall et al. and O'Mallet et al. [23] [24] [25] . The participants were asked in a Likert scale how strongly they agreed or disagreed with each statement asking on trust in various dimensions. Higher scores indicate greater trust. The self-reported chronic condition was defined as whether the respondents had long-term medical follow up or chronic medication. The self-reported HRQoL was measured by using the culturally validated Hong Kong Chinese scale of EQ-5D-5L instrument (EQ-5D-5L HK) [26] [27] [28] . The scale consists of a five-dimension descriptive system for self-reported health status (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has five response levels describing the health status with a level of severity (1 = no problem, 2 = slight, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and 5 = unable/extreme problems). In addition, the single preference-based health index (utility scores, ranged 0-1) was derived from the collective responses of the five dimensions on self-reported health status according to the Hong Kong population tariff to reflect the selfreported HRQoL.\n",
            " Data analysis was performed by the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 (IBM). The primary outcome variable was a dichotomous variable on acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Univariate analysis was based on Pearson's chi-square tests. Multivariable regression analysis was conducted with vaccine acceptance as the outcome variable whilst controlling for the above covariates with p values < 0.20 in univariate analysis. We tested for variable interaction among all potential independent variables using product terms, and found that there was a significant interaction between the HBM constructs and the trust scales. Hence, we performed three independent binary logistic regression analyses with (1). trust scale excluded; (2). HBM variables excluded; and (3). trust scale and HBM variables excluded, but included the four components of clues to action (recommendations by the Government, physicians, family members and friends, respectively). All p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. This study was approved by the Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Reference No. SBRE-19-796).\n",
            " The response rate to our telephone interview was 55%, and 1200 successful interviews were completed. (Supplementary Table 1 ). The total number of call attempts was 21,256. The majority were aged ! 55 years (68.6%), and female participants consist of 71.4% of the sample (Table 1) . Among them, 77.5% were married, and most had received educational below or at secondary level (76.4%). Around 31% was receiving old age allowance, and most were retired (35.8%) or housewives (34.6%).\n",
            " Overall, 42.2% of study participants indicated acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, whilst 17.4% expressed unwillingness, and 40.4% indicated not sure. Age, but not sex, showed a significant association with acceptance [univariate analysis, p < 0.01]. After a set of weighed adjustments according to the actual age structure of the Hong Kong population, we projected that the overall COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate for Hong Kong adults (!18 years) was 37.2% (95% C.I. 34.5-39.9%) (Supplementary Table 2 ). The projected acceptance rates exhibited a J-shape with age, with higher acceptance (40.4%, 95% C.I. 32.3-49.0%) among the younger generation aged 18-24 years than individuals aged 25-34 years (24.4%), and then a linear increase with age reaching 47.6% (95% C.I. 41.3-54.2%) among subjects aged ! 65 years (Fig. 1) .\n",
            " In addition to traditional variables for vaccine acceptance, our survey covered a few key variables that are relevant to the current context of COVID-19 vaccine production (Table 1) . We found a substantial proportion of the respondents did not feel confident on vaccines produced by manufacturers without experience of largescale vaccine production (52.2%); developed using new platforms (43.3%); or tested in clinical trials with <50,000 people (32.5%). A significant proportion of the participants considered the country where the vaccine was produced would affect their confidence level (37.4%). Also, 62.5% indicated that the country where vaccine was produced would influence their acceptance, and 67.2% agreed that if the vaccine has been tested in < 50,000 people, their acceptance of the vaccine would be reduced (Fig. 3 ).\n",
            " From univariate analysis (Table 2) , older age (!65 years), educational attainment at primary level or below, receipt of old age or disability allowance, retirement, and the presence of selfreported health status (having chronic medication and poorer HRQoL) were associated with higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. Respondents who perceived higher susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, perceived higher severity of COVID-19 to their own health, perceived greater benefits of vaccine, and received cues to action were significantly more likely to indicate vaccine acceptance (Table 2 ). Participants who perceived higher access barriers to receiving the vaccine and greater harm of the vaccine were less likely to express acceptance. Trust in the healthcare system and the vaccine manufacturer were positively associated with vaccine acceptance.\n",
            " In multivariable regression analysis without the trust scale (Model 1), perceived severity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.16, 95% C.I. 1.01 to 1.32, p = 0.037), perceived benefits of the vaccine (aOR 1.22, 95% C.I. 1.01 to 1.48, p = 0.037), and more cues to action (aOR 2.61, 95% C.I. 2.32 to 2.94, p < 0.001) remained to be positive correlates of vaccine acceptance; whilst perceived access barriers (aOR 0.80, 95% C.I. 0.68 to 0.94, p = 0.007) and perceived harm (aOR 0.77, 95% C.I. 0.64 to 0.94, p = 0.008) maintained to be negative factors associated with acceptance. When cues to action was analysed independent of other HBM constructs (Model 2), recommendations from the Government (aOR 10.2, 95% C.I. 6.54 to 15.9, p < 0.001), physicians (aOR 2.06, 95% C.I. 1.37 to 3.09, p < 0.001) and family members (aOR 2.07, 95% C.I. 1.36 to 3.16, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with higher vaccine acceptance. In regression models without HBM constructs (Model 3), the presence of chronic conditions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.45, 95% C. I. 1.04 to 2.03. p = 0.030) as well as trust in the healthcare system (aOR 1.30, 95% C.I. 1.17 to 1.45, p < 0.001) and vaccine manufacturers (aOR 1.69, 95% C.I. 1.56 to 1.83, p < 0.001) were positively associated with the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (See Fig. 2 and Table 3 ).\n",
            " From this telephone survey of the general public of Hong Kong, we found that 42.2% of the respondents indicated acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, corresponding to a projected acceptance of 37.3% among the whole adult population in Hong Kong. The ageacceptance curve exhibited a J shape showing higher acceptance among young adults, then increased gradually with age. We also identified several independent factors associated with acceptance, including the presence of chronic conditions, five out of six constructs of the HBM, trust in the healthcare system and the vaccine manufacturers, as well as the quality of life of the respondents. Recommendation of COVID-19 vaccination by the government was the strongest factor (aOR 10.2), whereas perceived susceptibility to infection was not associated with vaccine acceptance. Despite our surveillance being conducted at the peak of the third COVID-19 wave in Hong Kong when the record high daily confirmed cases was reported, our proportion of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (42.2% of respondents, and 37.2% for whole adult population after adjustment) was far lower than those of other countries [5, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . One possible explanation of the low acceptance could be due to a substantial proportion of respondents who expressed doubt about vaccines based on the newer genetic platforms, and yet these newer vaccines are now in the front end of clinical trial. Of note, our survey was conducted before the announcement of holding up a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial due to the report of an adverse event. Other worries impacting acceptance as expressed by a significant number of study participants included the track record of manufacturers on massive vaccine production as well as the unacceptability of vaccines produced based on small-scale clinical trials and their uncertainty about the country where the new COVID-19 vaccine will be produced. While these contemporary issues of COVID-19 vaccines have not been addressed in previous studies, our findings urge a need to address them, and any wrong information and misunderstandings should be clarified before launching vaccination campaign.\n",
            " We found that elderly individuals had higher acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. This finding is consistent with results from previous studies [30, 31] . One might argue that elderly individuals, especially after their retirement, are in general more healthconscious and are having a higher risk of contracting more serious disease and death due to COVID-19 [33] . This may also account for our finding that people with chronic conditions were significantly more likely to express vaccine acceptance. This observation reas-sures the current policy to regard these individuals as a top priority group to receive COVID-19 vaccine [33] . The higher level of vaccine acceptance among the youngest adult group aged 18-24 years could be attributed to most being students, who have better exposure to vaccine education and received free vaccines since they were born [34] . As a result, they may have a better impression on vaccination when compared with other age groups.\n",
            " Most of the HBM constructs were found to be significantly associated with vaccine acceptance. In particular, respondents who perceived COVID-19 as serious, the vaccine as conferring benefits, and received cues to action were significantly more likely to accept the vaccine. On the other hand, the perception of access barriers and potential harm induced by the vaccine were negatively associated with their acceptance. Similar HBM outcomes were also found in a study performed in Malaysia, and in addition, they found that the public value the efficacy and safety of vaccines more than the cost of the vaccines [32] . These findings suggested that the constructs of HBM could be used to explain vaccine uptake behaviour, as in previous studies demonstrating the capability of the HBM constructs in predicting behaviours related to influenza vaccination [35] . While cues to action is an important element of HBM and they were found to be a significant driving force of vaccine acceptance, we found a remarkable pattern for COVID-19 vaccine. The recommendation from the government stood out as the most important cue, far stronger than others, such as those from doctors and family members. Therefore, instead of leaving the decision to individuals or their doctors, governmental should make a clear stand. Furthermore, another common driver for adult vaccines, peer group, also did not turn out to be an important driver. These observations provide evidence-based design of vaccine promotion campaigns tailored for the context of the population concern.\n",
            " Trust in vaccination contributes to explain vaccination uptake [36] . Owing to the huge demand of COVID 19 vaccine, a lot of new manufacturers entered the market [37] . However, because of the lack of knowledge and too many manufacturers all come at once, it is more likely for potential vaccine recipients to doubt the legitimacy of less well known manufacturers, which could in turn lower their vaccine acceptance. Government should also proactively provide information about their selected vaccine manufacturer(s) to break this barrier.\n",
            " Of note, we found that a key component of HBM perceived susceptibility to infection was not associated with acceptance. This observation could be explained by the fact that COVID-19 is perceived as a mild disease unless the infected person has underlying at risk conditions. This implies the direction of promotion and education for COVID-19 vaccine might have to be different from other vaccines in which prevention of infection is perceived as the main purpose. Rather, perceived severity being a significant factor should be a focus for vaccine campaigns. This is the first representative population-based study in Hong Kong that examined the association between the constructs of HBM, the level of trust to relevant stakeholders, and the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. It has a high response rate based on a random sampling strategy, and the survey instrument was validated by an expert panel. There are, nevertheless, several limitations that should be addressed. Firstly, this is a cross-sectional survey and we could not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the independent factors and the outcome. They could however be used in prediction of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Also, this survey examined the HMB constructs and trust scales in a Chinese population, and the generalisability of its findings to other settings should be cautious. In addition, since the COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been implemented for use among the general public, and the figures on effectiveness and safety remained unknown, an indication of willingness to receive the vaccine could be considered preliminary -which is subject to further provision of efficacy and safety profiles by pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, intention or willingness to receive a vaccine does not necessarily translate into actual vaccine uptake, especially when there is a relatively long period of time between the measurement of willingness and observation of health promotion behaviour [34] . In addition, the present survey focused on the acceptance level among adults and future studies should be performed among adolescents and children. Finally, since the telephone survey relies on landline and there is a possibility of selection bias, although more than 91% of all Hong Kong residents were accessible to landlines. In summary, this study has examined the factors independently associated with potential vaccine uptake. Our findings highlighted the significance of governmental recommendation on vaccine uptake, whereas perceived susceptibility to infection was not. Acceptance could be impaired by worries on newer vaccination approaches and manufacturers. These constructs and independent predictors identified provide evidence-based formulation and implementation of vaccination strategies that aim to enhance vaccine uptake.\n",

            " Viral diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health. The world has witnessed several viral epidemics in past twenty years that include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Recently, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China and reported to China Country Office of The World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019. The National Health Commission of China reported that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan City. The etiological agent of the atypical pneumonia was isolated on January 7, 2020 by the Chinese authorities as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus identified was shared to other countries to develop specific diagnostic kits on January 12, 2020. Subsequently, the Ministry of Public Health Thailand, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan and Republic of Korea reported their first imported case of lab-confirmed 2019-nCoV on 13 January 13, January 15 and January 20, 2020 respectively. Subsequently, International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses termed it SARS-Cov-2, due to similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the SARS. On February 11, 2020, the WHO announced that the disease caused by this new virus as a \"COVID-19,\" which is the acronym of \"coronavirus disease 2019\". On March 11, 2020 , WHO declared this disease as pandemic. As of March 30, 2020, WHO has reported 693,224 case and 33,104 death, that has occurred worldwide [1].\n",
            " Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to Coronaviridae family of order Nidovirale. CoV are single-stranded RNA viruses (þssRNA) having a spike glycoprotein on the envelope, giving it a crown-like appearance, when seen on electron microscope. The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae has four genera of CoVs: Alpha-coronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Delta-coronavirus and Gamma-coronavirus. Furthermore, the genus Beta-coronavirus divides into five sub-genera or lineages. While bats and rodents are considered to be the genetic sources of alpha and beta-coronavirus, avian species represents the genetic sources of delta and gamma-coronavirus [2] .\n",
            " To date, seven human coronaviruses (HCov) have been identified. The A lineage of beta-coronavirus (such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) as well as alpha-coronavirus (such as HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63), causes common colds and self-limiting respiratory infections. In contrast, B lineage of beta-corona virus causes SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID- 19) , while C lineage of beta-corona virus causes MERS-CoV; both responsible for recent epidemics with a variable clinical severity of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary involvement and associated significant increase in mortality [3] .\n",
            " COVID-19 is a single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus, having a diameter of 60e140 nm with a round or elliptic shape, however, it often exists in pleomorphic form. Its RNA genome contains 29891 nucleotides, encoding for 9860 amino acids and shares 99.9% sequence identity, suggesting a very recent host shift into humans [4, 5] . Like other CoVs, it is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. Besides, these viruses can be effectively inactivated by lipid solvents including chloroform, ether (75%), ethanol, peroxyacetic acid and chlorine-containing disinfectant. Chlorhexidine does not inactivate this virus [4, 5] .\n",
            " Coronaviruses are naturally hosted by bats and it is believed that most human coronaviruses are derived from the bat reservoir [5, 6] . Genomic sequence studies of COVID-19 have identified nearly 50%, 79% and 96% similarity to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and bat SARSrelated coronavirus, respectively [7e9]. The specific route of transmission to human from natural reservoirs is still yet to be known, however, some of the studies suggests pangolin could be the intermediate mammalian hosts. Since spike protein of SAR-CoV-2 are nearly identical to one virus isolated from pangolin, it is believed that pangolins could have provided a partial spike gene to SARS-CoV-2, to infect mammals [10, 11] . A recent study has also shown a development of new variations at the functional sites in the receptor-binding domain of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin, likely caused due to either a natural selection or mutations or recombination or both [12] .\n",
            " Nevertheless, once human is infected, virus could also be transmitted from human-to-human through the respiratory droplets and aerosols from coughing and sneezing, like other respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 also uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors like the SARS-CoV [13] .\n",
            " The incubation period of COVID-19 could vary from 3 days to 14 days, based on the data from Chinese CDC. The longest time from infection to symptoms was 12.5 days (95% CI, 9.2e18 days). The Chinese epidemic also doubled about every seven days and on average, each patient transmits the infection to an additional 2.2 individuals, suggesting the basic reproduction number (R0 or R naught) to be 2.2, which is a bit lesser compared to R0 of the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic of nearly 3.0, in 2002e2003 [14, 15] . An epidemiological and transmission difference in characteristics between SARS-CoV1, MERS and Covid-19 has been summarized in Table 1. A recent study from a genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n ¼ 103) found this virus to be evolving into two major types (designated as L and S) with two different SNPs. While the L type is more prevalent (~70%), aggressive and spread more quickly, as seen in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the S type (~30%) is an ancestral version, evolutionarily older, and less aggressive. It appears that the frequency of the L type has decreased after early January 2020, and it is hypothesized that the change in selective pressure might change the behavior of this virus. It is thought that coercive human interventions may have placed a more severe selective pressure on the L type to mutate to S type. Conversely, the S type might have been increased also due to a relatively weaker selective pressure [13] .\n",
            " These ultra-rapid development in viral epidemics strongly suggest an urgent need of understanding about these viral dynamics to cope up with this public health emergency of COVID-19.\n",
            " There may be a variety of symptoms that a patient with COVID-19 may present with. The usual triad to suspect is fever, dry cough and dyspnea. It may be classified as asymptomatic or symptomatic, carrier or infective state, from mild prodrome to profusely symptomatic; depending upon immunity status of patients. There are reports of conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain. Some critically ill may present without fever but with abdominal pain, anorexia and dyspnea. Less common symptoms were gastrointestinal, anosmia, dysgeusia [13] . Overall, the case fatality rate was varied between 2.3% and 5% with an average of 3%. Poor prognostic epidemiological risk factors include older age, male sex, smokers and associated comorbidities including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary diseases, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. More the number of risk factors, more is the severity at presentation [18] .\n",
            " Depending on the clinical features of COVID-19, patients are generally divided as mild, moderate, severe and critical [18] .\n",
            " a. Mild COVID-19: low grade fever, cough, malaise, rhinorrhea, sore throat with or without hemoptysis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, but without any radiological features of pneumonia and absence of mental changes. b. Moderate COVID-19: fever, respiratory symptoms including dry cough and shortness of breath that may emerge along with the radiological features [15] . c. Severe COVID-19: dyspnea, respiratory frequency 30/minute, blood oxygen saturation 93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24e48 h. d. Critical COVID-19: usually develops after 7 days in patients with mild/moderate/severe COVID-19 with features of Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation along with presence of multiorgan dysfunction failure, metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction.\n",
            " The differences in clinical features of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-Co-V1, MERS-CoV have been summarized in Table 2 [16e23].\n",
            " Hemogram: leukopenia especially lymphopenia (in 80% of cases), mild thrombocytopenia. However, leukocytosis has also been reported [13, 17] . Some researchers suggested neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio (NLR) as an independent risk factor for severe illness and NLR 3.13 was considered as threshold for progression to severe illness in COVID-19 patients.\n",
            " Inflammatory Markers: serum procalcitonin is normal initially, may increase with severity. Increase in C-Reactive Protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), SGOT, troponin (rule out non coronary false positive; refer Table 3) , D-dimer, ferritin, Creatine kinase and ESR [24] . CRP may be used to track the severity of disease. Severe and critically ill patients may have very high levels of other inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-4, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. Poor laboratory prognostic factors include high D-Dimer, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, CRP [13] . However, these findings may not always concur with the contact/travel history/clinical symptoms. Table 3 summarizes the important investigations and prognostic factors [16, 24] .\n",
            " Serology: Blood sampling is much easier than swab sampling from oropharynx or nasopharynx. Two kinds of serological test can detect COVID-19 -a. Enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) and b. Immunochromatography (Card test). ELISA is considered better compared to card test due to higher sensitivity. While ELISA has sensitivity of 87.3%, Card test has a sensitivity of 82.4%, and both have specificity of 100%. However, card test is convenient, cheaper and offers a rapid turnover [25] . ELISA is based on Rp3 nucleoprotein to detect IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Although ELISA has quick turn over time, however it may have a false positive results due to N (Nucleocapsid) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 [16, 26] . Cross reactivity is expected with SARS-CoV-1 infection since there is 90% homology in genetic sequence with SARS-CoV-2. Hence, S protein (Transmembrane Glycoprotein Spike) ELISA should be developed specific to SARS-CoV-2.\n",
            " Reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR): RT-PCR, and genomic sequencing (wherever available) is the gold standard and confirmatory test for COVID-19. Overall, the sensitivity of RT-PCR is nearly 70% with a 30% false negative rate, and its sensitivity decreases from >90% on day 1-to 3 postsymptoms, to nearly 80% on day 6 and < 50% by day 14 [27] . For RT-PCR, specimen collection from the upper/lower respiratory tract or sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage samples to be performed under strict precautions, and should be taken as early as symptom onset, to obtain high virus concentrations [28] . It should be noted that RT-PCR may take few hours to 2 days for reporting and second sample with different viral gene may be needed if initial test is negative. Moreover, RT-PCR may be false negative at a times e.g. low viral load in very early phase or in late phase of disease, mutation of COVID-19 virus or other technical difficulties in collection of samples. Similarly, result may be false-positive in influenza or other respiratory pathogens. In either case it is important to remain vigilant. Other issues with RT-PCR is incorrect sample collection and processing, potential risk to health care workers due to aerosol transmission, beside delayed report delivery, requirement of expertise, setup of laboratory and the cost [27] .\n",
            " Although both serology and RT-PCR are complimentary to each other, however since antibodies can appear as early as 1-day postsymptoms, it is estimated that IgM-ELISA can detect more cases than RT-PCR on day 5.5 of illness [27] . While another study reported a higher sensitivity (66.7%) of RT-PCR in first week, compared to the serological test (38.0%). However, during second week, the serological test had higher sensitivity than RT-PCR. Collectively, this suggest ideally to combine both the modalities of test to increase the sensitivity for early detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 [27, 28] . Indeed, the combined IgM-ELISA plus RT-PCR has been shown to detect 98.6% of cases versus 51.9% with a single RT-PCR [26e28].\n",
            " From the available evidence [16,25e28] and to put the things in to perspective, it is logical as well as advisable (but not superseding any recommendation, if any) that e a. for the rapid screening of Table 1 Differences in epidemiological characteristics between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [15, 18, 23, 24, 31] \n",
            " Summary of important investigations and prognostic factors [17, 25] . SARS-CoV-2 carriers (symptomatic or asymptomatic), combined IgM-IgG-ELISA may offer a better utility and sensitivity, compared to a either a IgM-or IgG-ELISA test alone. b. all symptomatic subjects or contacts should be assessed with rapid antibody testing first, if positive then RT-PCR should be done as the confirmatory test. c. all highly suspicious cases should undergo RT-PCR first, even if the rapid antibody tests are negative. d. If antibody test is negative initially, it should be re-tested after 7e10 days. Bronchoscopy: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be done when sputum sample cannot be obtained to rule out alternative diagnosis such as tuberculosis and other bacterial or fungal pneumonias and to remove bronchial mucous plugs. Strict precautions are to be taken while doing BAL to avoid aerosol infections. The sensitivity (positivity rates) of RT-PCR in patients with SARS-CoV-2 in different specimen in was lowest for urine 0% and highest for BAL 93%, as summarized in Table 4 [29] .\n",
            " Radiological examination includes Chest X-ray (CXR), Computed tomography (CT) and point-of-care lung sonography, done on a case to case basis. Avoid pulmonary function test as chances of droplet infection may be high. CXR findings are non-specific, normal in initial phases to patchy unilateral or bilateral involvement to lobar/multi-lobar/bilateral consolidation [30] .\n",
            " The CT changes are of four stages: a. Early stage of ground glass opacities (GGO) in sub-pleural distribution involving mainly lower lobes. b.

            "Body Text:\n",
            " A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t \"A syndemic is defined as an occurrence when two or more epidemics interact synergistically to produce an increased burden of disease in a population\" -a term proposed by Merrill Singer in the mid-1990s. The COVID-19 pandemic has become an extreme form of syndemic, a pan-syndemic, where pockets of inequities (not limited to health) have been brought to light by increased disease burden and mortality compressed in a short time period throughout the world. 1 This pan-syndemic is not limited to just the US, indeed higher mortality has been documented in under-served populations throughout the world in both developed and developing countries. [2] [3] [4] Few studies have systematically used geographical information system (GIS) data to interrogate the underlying patterns of COVID-19 incidence, spread and disease outcomes. 5 The study \"Beyond the 405 and the 5: geographic variations and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in LA County\" by Vijayan et al in this issue analyzes one important facet in the continuum of the pandemic response -COVID-19 testing. Their study reveals the pervasiveness of inadequate access to testing even in communities such as the LA County. The authors of this study use GIS to integrate information from the LA department of health and US census in order to identify socio-structural determinants that have an effect on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. The authors rightly point out that the interplay between disease and socio-structural processes result in geographically distinct clusters and using GIS to analyze such data gives us important insights into the underlying driving forces of the pandemic. More importantly, such information also gives us actionable data to assist the public health initiative and devise effective socio-structural processes for an effective pandemic response.\n",
            " Vijayan et al show that low rates of test positivity and high testing were geographically clustered in affluent areas while the converse was found in neighborhoods with high population density and A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t poverty. Interestingly, their Spatial analysis also identified that one ethnicity, namely Hispanic, by itself was a \"risk factor\" for higher rates of test positivity.\n",
            " Data suggests that Hispanics work in essential jobs with lower pay and lack economic safety net that may result in increased exposure compared to other cohorts. 6 A significant proportion of Latino/a population is undocumented which makes them more vulnerable to economic insecurity especially during lockdowns due to being ineligible for federal assistance. Moreover, living in overcrowded areas with multigenerational housing potentially increases the frequency of contact and spread within the community. Language and cultural barriers also compound the difficulty to care due to access issues. 7, 8 It is well known that people living in disadvantaged neighborhoods and minority ethnic groups have unequal exposure to social determinants of health including housing, education, work and job security and access to health-care all of which compound to cause a higher chronic disease burden of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. 1,9 That COVID-19 has higher morbidity and mortality with higher chronic disease burden including untreated hypertension and diabetes is also well documented. This unfortunate recurrent theme of higher disease morbidity in the more disadvantaged populations is recapitulated both historically and contemporaneously from 1918 pandemic to the current COVID-19 pandemic. 1,10\n",
            " Having worked in underserved communities for the better part of the past decade, I have observed first-hand the high burden of chronic diseases stemming from a multitude of factors, which culminate in inequities, best described as structural violence. 11 Farmer et al. defines the term \"structural violence is one way of describing social arrangements that put individuals and populations in harm's way. The arrangements are structural because they are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world; they are violent because they cause injury to A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t people\". 11 Structural violence, a jarring term, immediately brings to realization the effect this has on the affected communities and populations. By really understanding the structural determinants that impact health equity we can envision structural interventions that are designed to systematically address those health inequities. The success of the Baltimore AIDS study in the 1990s is testament to that fact. Chaisson et al show that when given consistent medical care to HIV patients there was no difference in survival or disease progression between different groups based on race, income or sex. 12 Unfortunately, neither our medical curriculum nor the clinical training has historically focused on the importance of social forces that alter disease outcomes. It is well known that most disease modifying interventions fail if the social context is not taken into account. 13 Some physicians are likely to dismiss this as a political issue, which although true, we as physicians have a responsibility to our patients to understand their social, economic and cultural circumstances and utilize the tools available in our existing health systems to improve access to care. The political problem of structural violence requires a systematic political commitment to erase such inequities which unfortunately is a long time coming. In addition to other well-known factors, an additional factor stems from the current administration's anti-immigration rhetoric which impels immigrant, esp. Latino/a , people away from receiving care due to the concern for deportations of either themselves or close family. In addition, the specter of child separations in the border do not add to the confidence in \"the system\". 14 When I see Latino/a patients, I make it a practice to personally reassure patients that healthcare is separate from the government entity and care /testing will be provided irrespective of ability to pay for testing or treatment, a vision that is shared by the hospital system I work at.\n",
            " A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Physicians and health systems need to project confidence for vulnerable patients that inclusion and support is a part of their culture. Setting aside divisive rhetoric and embracing all of humanity as worthy of equitable care is the only way forward from this pandemic to a new post COVID-era.\n",
            " Systemic inequities have become invisible through decades of accepted threads of nativism, racism, sexism and elitism but the pandemic has shined a spot light by amplifying these inequities into a pan-syndemic. It is time that we take action to mitigate and in time hope to erase such inequities. A commitment to the assertion that healthcare is a basic human right irrespective of race, wealth, creed or citizenship is vital. Para-phrasing MLK Jr -\"No one is healthy unless we all are healthy\" rings true particularly in the light of the current COVID-19 pan-syndemic.\n",

            " The current wave of COVID-19 infections, which widely believed as an outbreak that initially sprout within the city of Wuhan in China, is beginning to assume alarming proportions across the globe, as cautioned by reports from the World Health Organization (WHO). Viral incidence rates that began to spike from the early December 2019 were the resultant cause of an infection that had contracted from a novel coronavirus (CoV) (form. 2019-nCoV). By the mid of April 2020, the global number of positive COVID-19 cases, as determined by the WHO, stood at 1,699,576 and has been climbing dangerously. Until the same period, the total deaths worldwide due to the disease were 102,734, the worst affected being the United States. It is worthwhile to note that the typically decorated Coronaviridae family, which pri- However, from a pharmacological viewpoint, we have enough evidence now to believe that the aerosolized droplet transmission of COVID-19 viral particles to the lungs involves several key pathological molecular mechanisms.\n",
            " It is well-observed among most viruses that, the common mechanism of their entry into a host cell is through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Looking at the bigger picture, we are convinced to think that the receptor employed by the COVID-19 virus to attack and modify the cells in the lungs could most probably be ACE2, a protein that is found on the surface of the cells in the kidney, heart tissues, artery and veins, and most significantly, on the epithelial cells (AT2) of the alveoli of the lungs. Moreover, AT2 cells are vulnerable to virus borne infections (Richardson et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Having mentioned that, the COVID-19 viral particles have the notorious tendency to proteolytically generate mutated, biologically active fragments of RAS, namely, Ang II and Ang 1-7. These biological fragments may subsequently activate the AT2 receptors, leading them to bind with ACE2. AT2 is a type of G-protein coupled receptor (Clayton proliferation at a faster rate in the later stages of apoptosis in defective cell (Figure 1 ).\n",
            " Here, we conclude that the COVID-19 virus activates the JNK and JAK-STAT mediated biochemical mechanisms in lungs, resulting in the proliferation and transmission of viral cells. Moreover, before recommending ACE2 inhibitors, it is worthwhile to be mindful and aware of the complications that arise during the blockade of the enzyme, which could lead to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Thus, we summarize that both JNK and JAK-STAT pathways could be targeted pharmacologically for the inhibition of the COVID-19 infection. Moreover, there must be effective strategies to contain the spread before a vaccine can be developed.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Colson et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020) . The scientific community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the field of antiviral research.\n",
            " The sulfate and phosphate salts of chloroquine have both been commercialised as antimalarial drugs. Hydroxychloroquine has also been used as an antimalarial, but in addition is now broadly used in autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Of note, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered to be safe and side-effects are generally mild and transitory. However, the margin between the therapeutic and toxic dose is narrow and chloroquine poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular disorders that can be life-threatening (Frisk-Holmberg et al., 1983) . Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use should therefore be subject to strict rules, and self-treatment is not recommended.\n",
            " The in vitro antiviral activity of chloroquine has been identified since the late 1960's (Inglot, 1969; Miller and Lenard, 1981; Shimizu et al., 1972) and the growth of many different viruses can be inhibited in cell culture by both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, including the SARS coronavirus (Keyaerts et al., 2004) . Some evidence for activity in mice has been found for a variety of viruses, including human coronavirus OC43 (Keyaerts et al., 2009) , enterovirus EV-A71 (Tan et al., 2018) , Zika virus (Li et al., 2017) and influenza A H5N1 (Yan et al., 2013) . However, chloroquine did not prevent influenza infection in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Paton et al., 2011) , and had no effect on dengue-infecteds patient in a randomized controlled trial in Vietnam (Tricou et al., 2010) . Chloroquine was also active ex vivo but not in vivo in the case of ebolavirus in mice (Dowall et al., 2015; Falzarano et al., 2015) , Nipah (Pallister et al., 2009 ) and influenza virus (Vigerust and McCullers, 2007) in ferrets.\n",
            " The case of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is of specific interest: chloroquine showed promising antiviral activity in vitro (Coombs et al., 1981; Delogu and de Lamballerie, 2011) , but was shown to enhance alphavirus replication in various animal models (Maheshwari et al., 1991; Roques et al., 2018; Seth et al., 1999) , most probably because of the immune modulation and anti-inflammatory properties of chloroquine in vivo (Connolly et al., 1988; Katz and Russell, 2011; Savarino et al., 2003) . In a nonhuman primate model of CHIKV infection, chloroquine treatment was shown to exacerbate acute fever and delay the cellular immune response, leading to an incomplete viral clearance (Roques et al., 2018) . A clinical trial conducted during the chikungunya outbreak in 2006 in Réunion Island showed that oral chloroquine treatment did not improve the course of the acute disease (De Lamballerie et al., 2008) and that chronic arthralgia on day 300 postillness was more frequent in treated patients than in the control group (Roques et al., 2018) . Altogether, the assessment of previous trials indicates that, to date, no acute virus infection has been successfully treated by chloroquine in humans.\n",
            " Chloroquine has also been tested in chronic viral diseases. Its use in the treatment of HIV-infected patients has been considered inconclusive (Chauhan and Tikoo, 2015) and the drug has not been included in the panel recommended for HIV treatment. The only modest effect of chloroquine in the therapy of human virus infection was found for chronic hepatitis C: an increase of the early virological response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (Helal et al., 2016) and, in a small sample size pilot trial in non-responder HCV patients, a transient viral load reduction (Peymani et al., 2016) were observed. This was not enough to include chloroquine in the standardised therapeutic https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104762 Received 29 February 2020; Received in revised form 2 March 2020; Accepted 2 March 2020 protocols for hepatitis C patients.\n",
            " Recently, Wang and colleagues (Wang et al., 2020) evaluated in vitro five FDA-approved drugs and two broad spectrum antivirals against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. One of their conclusions was that \"chloroquine (is) highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro\" and that its \"safety track record suggests that it should be assessed in human patients suffering from the novel coronavirus disease\". At least 16 different trials for SARS-CoV-2 already registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029939, ChiCTR2000029935, ChiCTR2000029899, ChiCTR2000029898, ChiCTR2000029868, ChiCTR2000029837, ChiCTR2000029826, ChiCTR2000029803, ChiCTR2000029762, ChiCTR2000029761, ChiCTR2000029760, ChiCTR2000029741, ChiCTR2000029740, ChiCTR2000029609, ChiCTR2000029559, ChiCTR2000029542) propose to use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 (\"Chinese Clinical Trial Register\" (ChiCTR)). In a recent publication (Gao et al., 2020) , Gao and colleagues indicate that, \"according to the news briefing\", \"results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course\".\n",
            " This would represent the first successful use of chloroquine in humans for the treatment of an acute viral disease, and is undoubtedly excellent news, since this drug is cheap and widely available. However, it should be considered carefully before drawing definitive conclusions, since no data has been provided yet to support this announcement. Results were produced in ten different hospitals and possibly from a number of different clinical protocols among those listed above, which include various designs for control groups (none, different antivirals, placebo, etc.) and various outcome primary indicators. The final interpretation is therefore technically demanding, and in the absence of published data, it is difficult to reach any firm conclusion. It will be of the utmost importance to know if the observed efficacy is associated specifically with chloroquine phosphate, or if this includes other salts (e.g., sulfate) of chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. It is also necessary to determine if the benefit of chloroquine therapy depends on the age class, the clinical presentation or the stage of the disease.\n",
            " In conclusion, the option of using chloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 should be examined with attention in light of the recent promising announcements, but also of the potential detrimental effect of the drug observed in previous attempts to treat acute viral diseases. We urge Chinese scientists to report the interim trial results currently running in China as soon as they are available. This should be preferentially done in a peer-reviewed publication with detailed information to allow the international scientific community to analyse the results, to confirm in prospective trials the efficacy of the proposed treatment and to guide future clinical practice.\n",

Research from previous pandemics such as the H1N1 influenza in 2009 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 highlighted the immense fear, panic and resultant psychological impact on the populace (5) . Following the COVID-19 outbreak, a webbased survey conducted in China highlighted an increase in symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (6) . The research identified that younger people are at increased risk, partly due to the time spent on social media. Another survey examining the UK population found that one in two people felt down, depressed or hopeless about the future potentially putting 41% of the nation's mental health at risk (7) . These mental health problems likely stem from 'hypochondriacal concerns' and other psychosocial elements related to economic, socialization and isolation issues (6) .\n",
            " Furthermore, patients and health care workers with other mental health conditions such as depression and somatoform disorders have reported worsening of symptoms along with relapses (8, 9) . Mortality has also been predicted to be higher in these individuals with concomitant COVID-19 infection (10) .\n",
            " With the stock market crashing and the ever-increasing likelihood of a recession, millions of people may lose their jobs. A lack of financial support in such circumstances will only worsen the psychological health of the public. In the USA, where health insurance is often tied to employment, this can lead to a greater level of stress and solutions can only be sought through changing state and government policy. On the other hand, in places such as the UK, where health care is freely available, times such as these can lead to resources being stretched and indeed, the use of new innovative technologies may help to reduce the burden on public health resources, through the provision of psychotherapies both by online humans and artificial intelligence algorithms (11) . It should be noted however that many of these applications are not free. All these factors create a recipe for major psychosocial disturbances in society. Now more than ever it is important that mental health matters are appropriately addressed and accounted for in this time of societal distress. Indeed, this is a great concern for primary care physicians.\n",
            " The carers are at great risk for psychological distress during pandemics. Evidence from the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks highlights the mental health burden on health professionals (12, 13) . A study conducted during the SARS outbreak in 2003 examining the psychological state of hospital staff found that being quarantined was the biggest predictor for the development of acute stress disorder. Furthermore, these staff including doctors, nurses and physician assistants who were quarantined were more likely to report detachment from others, anxiety, irritability, insomnia and subsequently suffered from deterioration in work performance and reluctance to work (14) . Indeed, similar trends are also being reported with Family Practice, 2020, 1-3 doi:10.1093/fampra/cmaa100 COVID-19 and the addressing of these issues is essential for a healthy workforce (15) (16) (17) .\n",
            " Perhaps one of the key failures in this pandemic has been data collection in real time, especially for mortality data from different sources, but the challenges of an unprecedented crisis, as well as lack of preparation of the public health system may be hindering factors.\n",
            " The immense pressure that medical staff are under whilst combatting the coronavirus is clear. A detailed plan involving online courses, group activities, assistance with accommodation and food, provision of leisurely activities to ease stress and detailed instructions on reducing the risk of contracting the disease should be implemented to reduce stress. It is important to ensure the health workers are not overworked and shift-based rotas be implemented ensuring adequate rest periods. Furthermore, in the UK, many companies aided health workers through the provision of free food, services, products, and accommodation. This was particularly helpful because it provided a site away from family and thus alleviates the stress of transmitting the virus to family members, many of whom may be vulnerable. Whilst this may be useful in the short term and provides good publicity for companies, it is not a sustainable option and thus governments should plan funding to companies to allow these schemes to be available for longer durations, and if further lockdowns are required, as necessary.\n",
            " There are three main priorities from a mental health perspective that should be incorporated into public health planning:\n",
            " 1. Prevent an increase in mental health burden 2. Protect people with pre-existing mental health disorders 3. Provide appropriate public mental health interventions to both members of the public and health professionals.\n",
            " Similarly, lessons can be learned to provide effective psychological management for members of the public. As a lot of normative patterns are disrupted due to the quarantine, it is important to establish a sense of normalcy. This can include simple measures such as having a regular, healthy sleeping pattern. Explaining to patients that, despite the quarantine, it is important to have regular time away from others within the same house, which can be helpful for some individuals. Others may require prompting to be more open and engage with individuals in the same household. For those living in isolation, contacting friends and families regularly is essential, and for those who do not have people whom they may contact, GPs should ensure that regular contact is maintained with vulnerable patients. GPs, however, are already stretched for time, and as such, the mass volunteering scheme that the UK has implemented can allow volunteers within the society to keep in contact with people who are at risk of being isolated. Other simple interventions such as exercise and relaxation techniques should also be encouraged to improve mental wellbeing. If gyms and public parks are closed, these activities should be encouraged at home. Hence, public health bodies must emphasize the importance of having a healthy routine at home, and staying connected to others via phone and text messaging. Institutions will also need to set up online platforms to provide psychological therapies and counselling for patients, family members and other individuals impacted by this pandemic.\n",
            " Tele-technologies employing video consultation may prove to be very beneficial in conducting remote consultations in accordance with current isolation guidelines (18) . Given the widespread use of the Internet and video call technologies, this will not be difficult be difficult to implement. In fact, video consultations are already routinely conducted through mobile health applications (19) . Online psychological therapies are well recognized, with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) widely used for numerous psychiatric conditions. Thus, patients currently receiving in person CBT should receive this therapy online. Furthermore, patients being seen for other nonmental health issues should be screened and tested for anxiety, social isolation, financial insecurity and general state of mind.\n",
            " This is an unprecedented situation and it is important to be malleable in our response. The mental health of those on the front lines rightfully need to be highlighted. However, the widespread nature of this pandemic is going to affect all corners of society. Hence, being proactive in finding active solutions to mitigate and improve mental health should be a high priority of public health bodies and physicians.\n",

Während zu Beginn der Pandemie nur relativ wenige Spitzensportlerinnen und Spitzensportler sich nachweislich mit SARS-CoV2 infiziert hatten, werden nicht nur durch die Einführung der routinemäßig durchgeführten PCRund Antigen-Tests vermehrt Infektionen detektiert. Durch das routinemäßige Testen werden auch Sportlerinnen und Sportler identifiziert, die eine asymptomatische Infektion haben. Es stellt sich einerseits die Frage, wie mit symptomatischen Sportlerinnen und Sportlern zu verfahren ist und auf der anderen Seite, wie mit asymptomatischen Athletinnen und Athleten umzugehen ist.\n",
            " Neben den komplett asymptomatischen Verläufen einer Infektion mit SARS-CoV2 variiert das klinische Bild zwischen milden Verläufen und schweren, teils letalen Verläufen, die vor allem Personen mit Vorerkrankungen oder in höherem Lebensalter betreffen. Zu den typischen Symptomen einer Infektion zählen Schnupfen, Husten, Halsweh, Kopfschmerzen, gastrointestinale Beschwerden, Fieber, Schüttelfrost und Abgeschlagenheit [1] .

EKG-Veränderungen als Ausdruck einer kardialen Mitbeteiligung der Infektion aufweisen [5] . Dabei scheint das Ausmaß der Erhöhung des Troponinwertes mit der Prognose vergesellschaftet zu sein [6] . Schon im Frühjahr 2020 wurde auf Basis theoretischer Ü berlegungen publiziert, dass eine kardiale Beteiligung einer Infektion mit SARS-CoV2 im Sinne einer Myokarditis möglich sein könnte und nicht nur auf schwere Krankheitsverläufe beschränkt sein dürfte [7] . Die Beurteilung, ob eine kardiale Affektion durch SARS-CoV2 vorliegt, ist von entscheidender Bedeutung, da die aktuellen Empfehlungen der Europäischen Gesellschaft für Kardiologie bei gesicherter oder vermuteter Myokarditis eine 3bis 6-monatige Sportpause vorsehen [8] . Daher ist die Frage, ob oder mit welcher Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Myokarditis im Rahmen der Infektion mit SARS-CoV2 vorliegt, für die Frage des Wiedereinstiegs in das Training und den Wettkampf nach COVID-19 von entscheidender Bedeutung. Der Anteil einer kardialen Beteiligung im Rahmen von COVID-19 wird je nach untersuchtem Kollektiv sehr unterschiedlich beziffert. In einem Kollektiv von insgesamt 30 professionellen Fußballspielern aus Italien fanden sich bei den 18 Spielern, die einen milden oder asymptomatischen Verlauf der Infektion durchgemacht hatten, keine wegweisenden Auffälligkeiten in der kardiologischen Diagnostik (Ruhe-und Belastungs-EKG, Echokardiographie) im Vergleich zur Voruntersuchung. Langzeit-EKG-Aufzeichnungen, die auch während des Trainings erfolgten, waren ohne Nachweis höhergradiger ventrikulärer Rhythmusstö rungen geblieben. Das ebenfalls durchgeführte Thorax-CT zeigte bei allen Spielern keine pulmonalen Veränderungen. Allerdings erfolgte lediglich bei einem Spieler, der einen erhöhten Troponin-I-Wert aufwies, eine MRT-Untersuchung des Herzens. Dieses zeigte keine Abweichungen von der Norm [9] . Huang et al. zeigten wiederum in ihrer Untersuchung an ehemals hospitalisierten Patienten, die nach Entlassung aus dem Krankenhaus über kardiale Symptome klagten, dass bei über der Hälfte in der MRT-Untersuchung myokarditistypsiche Veränderungen zu detektieren waren [10] . Rajpal berichtet in einem Kollektiv von 26 Sportlern, die nicht hospitalisiert waren, dass bei 15% myokarditistypische Befunde in der MRT-Untersuchung zu detektieren waren, wobei alle eingeschlossenen Athleten unauffällige Befunde im Ruhe-EKG und in der Echokardiographie aufwiesen [11] . Bemerkenswert an der kleinen Studie von Rajpal ist, dass bei 8 Athleten ein Late Enhancement ohne Vorliegen eines € Odems vorlag, was die Autoren nicht im Zusammenhang mit der akuten Infektion werteten, sondern als Zeichen einer früher durchgemachten Myokarditis. Im Gegensatz fand sich in einer Untersuchung an 145 Collegestudierenden nur bei zwei Athleten myokarditistypische Veränderungen in der MRT-Untersuchung nach gesicherter Infektion mit unterschiedlichem Schweregrad des Verlaufs [12] . Das Ausmaß bzw. der Anteil kardialer Affektionen scheint daher vom untersuchten Kollektiv und vom Umfang der Diagnostik abzuhängen.\n",
            " accepted that no physical activity should be carried out during the acute infection. The extent of the diagnosis, which is recommended before returning to (competitive) sport, is determined depending on the clinical course. While there were concerns at the beginning of the pandemic that cardiac involvement would occur in many cases, this risk initially seems to have been overestimated. On the other hand, there is increasing data that non-cardiac consequences of the infection can impair athletes in the practice of their sport in the long term. This article highlights the current recommendations regarding return to sports after COVID-19 for competitive and recreational athletes.\n",
            " Wann symptomatische und asymptomatisch infizierte Personen wieder in das Training oder den Wettkampfsport einsteigen können, wird kontrovers diskutiert. Einen ersten Vor-schlag für den Wiedereinstieg in Training und Wettkampf publizierte die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sportmedizin und Prävention (DGSP) als Positionspapier bereits zu Beginn der Pandemie im Frühjahr 2020 [13] . [15] . Einen Ü berblick über die Empfehlungen der drei Veröffentlichungen gibt Tabelle 1. Während die Empfehlungen der VBG als Arbeitsschutzstandards zu verstehen sind und sich somit in erster Linie auf BerufssportlerInnen beziehen, wurde kürzlich ein angepasster Entscheidungspfad für Sporttreibende publiziert, der eine Unterscheidung zwischen jugendlichen SportlerInnen und Masterathleten vornimmt [16] . Hier wird erstaunlicherweise auf eine zwingende ärztliche Untersuchung und Diagnostik zumindest bei asymptomatischen und Infizierten mit milder Symptomatik verzichtet. Selbst bei schweren Verläufen wird eine kardiovaskuläre Diagnostik bei unter 15-Jährigen nicht unbedingt gefordert. Lediglich das Auftreten neuer kardialer Symptome sollte sowohl bei Jugendlichen als auch bei Erwachsenen zu einer kardiovaskulären Evaluation führen. Um basierend auf den bisherigen Erkenntnissen einen im klinischen Alltag praktikablen Algorithmus für den Wiedereinstieg in Training und Wettkampf zur Verfügung zu stellen, zeigt Abb. 1 and 2 eine Modifizierung der bisherigen Vorschläge der DGSP unter Berücksichtigung der anderen Handlungsempfehlungen. Der vorgestellte Algorithmus kann sicherlich auch für den Freizeitsport Anwendung finden, zumal die potentiell erforderliche Diagnostik im deutschsprachigen Raum flächendeckend zur Verfügung steht. Für Ath-letInnen mit prolongierten Verläufen, deren Anteil am Gesamtkollektiv der Infizierten überschaubar ist, würde sich eine Vorstellung an einem spezialisierten (sportmedizinisch/sportkardiologischen) Zentrum empfehlen. Aus der Erfahrung heraus haben Leistungsund Profisportler, bei denen eine Minimierung des Ausfallzeit unter Umständen auch von Dritten (z. B. Verein, Management, Verband) gewünscht ist, ein enges (sportmedizinisches) Netzwerk, das die erforderliche Diagnostik zeitnah durchführen kann. Mindeststandards der medizinischen Versorgung sollten jedoch keinesfalls auf Druck der Athleten oder gar Dritter verlassen werden, um eine hinreichende Sicherheit für den Wiedereinstieg gewähren zu können. Auf der anderen Seite muss eine ,,Ü berdiagnostik'' vermieden werden. Die routinemäßige Durchführung einer kardialen MRT-Untersuchung könnte falsch positive oder nicht zwingend im Zusammenhang mit der akuten Infektion stehende Befunde ergeben, die -je nach Interpretation -dann zu einer möglicherweise nicht erforderlichen Sportkarenz mit negativen Konsequenzen für die Athletin oder den Athleten führen. \n",
            " In den letzten Monaten mehrten sich Berichte von Patienten, die nach einer durchgemachten Infektion mit SARS-CoV2 noch über anhaltende Symptome klagen. Dies betrifft nicht nur Patienten nach Hospitalisierung und somit schwerem Krankheitsverlauf [17] , sondern auch Infizierte mit nach mildem oder moderatem Verlauf der akuten Phase. Hierfür wurde der Begriff Long-CO-VID geprägt, wenn Symptome über einen Zeitraum von mehr als 28 Tagen nach der Infektion noch vorliegen [18] . Dabei scheint das Phänomen einer andauernden Symptomatik nach einer Infektion mit SARS-CoV2 nicht alleine auf Erwachsene beschränkt zu sein [19] . Gerade für Leistungssporttreibende kann eine anhaltende Fatigue nach COVID-19 zu einer deutlichen Beeinträchtigung der Trainings-und Wettkampfleistung führen. Ebenso sind Schlaf-störungen ein häufiges Symptom nach COVID-19, was die Regenerationsfähigkeit der SportlerInnen negativ beeinflussen kann. Auch andere teilweise langfristige Symptome, die primär zu keiner vitalen Gefährdung der AthletInnen führen, können immensen Einfluss auf die sportliche Performance haben. Eine Aufstellung möglicher nicht kardialer Komplikationen nach COVID-19, die für Leistungssporttreibende von Relevanz sein können, zeigt Tabelle 2.\n",

            " T oday, the world is facing one of the most devastating viral pandemics of our time where almost 62 million people have been infected with a novel corona virus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 (SARS-Cov2), and more than one million people have died from the corona virus induced disease . 1 The COVID-19 pandemic is also responsible for unprecedented loss of life, economic, social, and health consequences including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 2 cardiovascular, 3 mental health including anxiety, depression, and neurological complications like tremors, seizures, and impaired consciousness. 4 An estimated 45% of adults in the US reported that their mental health has been negatively impacted due to worry and stress over the virus. 5 Further, people with preexisting health conditions including asthma, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, immunocompromised state, neurological conditions such as dementia and others might be at increased risk from COVID-19. 6 The conditions such as imposed shelter-in-place, physical distancing, social isolation and potential financial distress from job loss might further lead to mental health problems, increased substance use, and possibly suicides. Furthermore, limited access to mental health care and addiction treatment health care providers for treating substance use disorder(s) may also in part exacerbate COVID-19 related complications, thereby necessitating the use of telemedicine to treat people with substance use disorder(s).\n",
            " Extensive efforts worldwide are underway to develop vaccines and therapeutics including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma to combat the coronavirus induced symptomatic disease (COVID-19) and associated complications. Even though long-term use of cannabis is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of panic attacks, 7 the internet is filled with suggestions for using cannabis or cannabinoids including cannabidiol (CBD) for the treatment of coronavirus infection induced inflammation and COVID-19 induced mental health conditions including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and panic attacks. The recent changes in legalization of CBD in many US states have made CBD products easily accessible to all as over the counter products. This commentary will briefly show that the use of CBD for the treatment of anxiety, depression and substance use disorder(s) are just myths and not a reality.\n",
            " Though CBD may be a promising drug to treat panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder, and depressive disorders 8 via serotonergic pathways and endocannabinoid system, extensive literature search failed to find sufficient clinical evidence to support CBD for treating any of the abovementioned mental conditions. 9 Much more clinical research from well-designed clinical trials is needed to support the use of CBD in treating anxiety and depressive disorders and bipolar disorders. 10 CBD may promote wakefulness via triggering increased dopamine levels in areas of the brain and thereby treat narcolepsy, and in a case report, 11 CBD did improve the quality and quantity of sleep of a 10-year old young patient with PTSD, likely due to its anxiety-relieving benefits. But these data from one patient are clearly insufficient to support the use of CBD for treating sleep disorders.\n",
            " Could CBD treat substance use disorders? The answer is not yet. Limited research suggests that CBD could potentially treat patients with substance use disorders like opioid-, cannabis-, and tobacco use disorders (OUD, CUD, TUD). 12 Earlier studies showed that legalization of medical marijuana reduced the number of over dose deaths from opioid pain relievers, 13 and that medical marijuana laws significantly reduced prescribing of opioids for pain. 14 More recently, Hurd et al 15 reported that acute administration of CBD to heroin abstinent patients with OUD significantly reduced craving, anxiety, heart rate and salivary cortisol without causing adverse effects. But still additional clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of CBD in treating opioid use disorder. 16 In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, 17 nabiximols (THCþCBD [Sativex]) combined with Motivational Enhancement Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT), reduced cannabis use and craving but not withdrawal symptoms in persons that used cannabis chronically. CBD also reduced euphoria and depressive and psychotic-like symptoms, improved attention, verbal learning and memory without impairing cognition when smoking cannabis, suggesting that prolonged therapy with CBD may be a useful adjunct therapy for treating cannabis dependence. 18 In a study of 24 tobacco smokers, CBD inhaler reduced the number of tobacco cigarettes by 40% when compared to placebo 19 ; and a single dose of 800 mg oral dose of CBD reduced the salience and pleasantness of cigarette cues, but did not influence tobacco craving or withdrawal or any subjectively rated side effects. 20 Data from these studies with a small number of patients present a positive signal of CBD's potential to treat substance use disorders, but significantly much more research from well-designed clinical trials is needed to support its wide use as treatment for substance use disorder(s).\n",
            " Thus, there is a clear paucity of data from well-designed clinical trials to support the use of CBD for treating anxiety, depression, other neurological complications associated with COVID-19 or substance use disorders. A careful systematic evaluation of CBD in large clinical trials is essential prior to endorsing its wider use for alleviation of mental health symptomatology. It is also of paramount importance that the clinicians treating patients with any of the above COVID-19 related mental or neurological conditions or substance use disorders inform their patients about the lack of sufficient unbiased clinical evidence for the use of CBD and discourage them from using CBD for COVID-19 related health problems during this COVID-19 related severe, unprecedented global health catastrophe.\n",
