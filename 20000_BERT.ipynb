            "Body Text: that small molecules produced by human-associated bacteria can affect not only host cells but also coinhabiting organisms of the microbiome (5, 6) . While many studies have focused on identifying microbiota-encoded metabolites that affect either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells, there are comparatively few examples of commensal metabolites that affect viral infection of host cells (7, 8) . Given that bacteria populate body sites that are frequently exposed to viruses, we sought to determine whether commensal bacteria encode metabolites that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",
            " Culture broth extracts from 50 phylogenetically diverse and commonly seen commensal bacteria were screened in a cell-based assay for the ability to inhibit infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2. Bioassay-guided fractionation and structure elucidation of the antiviral activities detected in this extract library led to our identification of three metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. These include the adenosine analogue N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)adenosine (IPA), the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HTR) agonist tryptamine, and the pyrazine 2,5-bis(3-indolylmethyl)pyrazine (BIP). Interestingly, there are clear structural and functional parallels between commensal bacteria-encoded and synthetic anti-SARS-CoV-2 active small molecules, as synthetic nucleosides, 5-HTR signaling modulators, and pyrazines have all been examined in either COVID-19 clinical trials or observational studies (e.g., remdesivir, fluvoxamine, and favipiravir, respectively) (9) (10) (11) . The identification of multiple commensal bacteria-encoded metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in this study suggests that the human microbiota likely represents an underexplored reservoir of antiviral small molecules.\n",
            " Creation and screening of a microbiome metabolite library. Although the human microbiome is composed of thousands of unique strains, metabolic redundancy across related bacteria suggests that examining a phylogenetically diverse subset of commensal bacteria is likely to uncover many of the common biologically active molecules that are produced by the microbiota (12) . For this study, we selected 50 strains cultured from body sites most likely to come in contact with viruses (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and skin) and distributed across the major phyla present in the human microbiome (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria). We sampled species from genera that are highly represented (e.g., Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides), as well as from those with only a small number of commensal species (e.g., Megasphaera, Coprobacillus), which allowed us to expand the phylogenetic diversity of our collection. Each strain was grown as a monoculture under the appropriate oxygen environment. After incubating at 37°C for 7 days, extracellular metabolites from these cultures were collected on Amberlite XAD7HP polymeric adsorbent. Resin-bound metabolites were then eluted to yield a library of crude bacterial extracts associated with a diverse collection of human-associated bacteria. In order to facilitate bioactive small-molecule discovery, we performed a prefractionation procedure on each extract in which the crude sample was partitioned by reverse-phase chromatography into 4 subfractions of increasing hydrophobicity (Fig. 1a) . The resulting extract fractions were tested at concentrations equivalent to a 25-fold (high) and an 8-fold (low) culture broth concentrate in an in vitro cell-based SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) infection assay.\n",
            " At the higher testing concentration (a 25-fold concentrate of culture broth), 10 bacteria produced at least 1 fraction that reduced viral infection to less than 10% (Fig. 1b) . To determine which of these activities were the result of individual antiviral metabolites instead of nonspecific inhibition due to the complex mixture of metabolites in the extract, each fraction that showed .90% inhibition was further partitioned by C-18 semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the resulting fractions were subject to another round of antiviral screening. Extracts from cultures of 4 bacteria (Ruminococcus gnavus, Prevotella nigrescens, Bacteroides caccae, and Micrococcus luteus) generated discrete antiviral-active HPLC fractions, from which individual anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolite(s) were purified and structurally characterized (Fig. 1b) .\n",
            " Characterization of microbiome-encoded SARS-CoV-2 active antivirals. (i) SARS-CoV-2 active pyrazines. Partitioning of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 active fraction from a culture of M. luteus SK58 that was isolated from a human skin sample (Human Microbiome Project [HMP] ID 569) (13) revealed a major antiviral active compound and a second HPLC peak with a similar UV trace but only minimal anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Structural elucidation of these two compounds by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) indicated that the FIG 1 Screening of human-associated bacteria for the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolites.

(b, iv) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and cytotoxicity of each purified metabolite in Huh-7.5 cells. n = 3; data are mean 6 SD. primary antiviral compound was 2,5-bis(3-indolylmethyl)pyrazine (BIP) (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), and the second compound was 2-(3-indolylmethyl)-5-methylpyrazine (IMP) (Fig. S2 and S9C ). To confirm these structures, BIP and IMP standards were synthesized from a-amino aldehydes using existing methods for producing pyrazine alkaloids (14) . Based on NMR and HR-MS, the synthetic and natural materials were spectroscopically identical ( Fig. S3 and S4 ). In dose-response testing against SARS-COV-2 infection of Huh-7.5 cells, purified BIP had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 70 mM (Fig. 1b) , while IMP displayed much weaker antiviral activity (IC 50 . 250 mM) (Fig. S5 ). Neither compound displayed significant cytotoxicity (CC 50 . 250 mM).\n",
            " (ii) SARS-CoV-2 active tryptamine. NMR and HR-MS data indicated that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolite produced by R. gnavus CC55_001C that was isolated from a colonic biopsy specimen (HMP ID 1201) (13) was tryptamine (Fig. S6 ). Its identity and activity were confirmed using a commercial tryptamine standard. R. gnavus is a well-established producer of tryptamine through the decarboxylation of tryptophan, a reaction that cannot be carried out by the human host (15) . It is a member of the microbiota of most children and adults and overrepresented in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (16) .\n",
            " In dose-response testing against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Huh-7.5 cells, tryptamine had an IC 50 of 33 mM (Fig. 1b) , with some loss in cell viability observed at the highest concentration tested (250 mM). Tryptamine is found in human feces at concentrations generally ranging from 10 to 25 mM and as high as 50 mM in some individuals (17) , making its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection within this same concentration range intriguing. Tryptamine is a potent agonist of a number of serotonin G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (5-hydroxytryptamine receptors ) and is especially active against HTR2C and HTR5A (50% effective concentration [EC 50 ], 70 nM) (5). Although we do not know whether the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of tryptamine was due to its 5-HTR agonism, a number of synthetic 5-HTR modulators have been reported to exert antiviral activity against other viruses. For example, the 5-HTR agonist 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT) reduces reovirus entry in vitro (18) , while the 5-HTR antagonist methiothepin mesylate (MM) was reported to inhibit Chikungunya virus replication (19) . To explore the relevance of 5-HTRs modulators to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assayed MM and 5-NT for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Both MM (IC 50 , 2.8 mM) and 5-NT (IC 50 , 70 mM) exhibited antiviral activity (Fig. 2) , illustrating that either agonism or antagonism of 5-HTR receptors can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. (iii) SARS-CoV-2 active N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)adenosine. Fractions from extracts of P. nigrescens CC14M that was identified in colonic biopsy specimen (HMP ID 1173) (13) and B. caccae CL03T12C61 cultured from a human fecal sample (HMP ID 1061) (13) yielded SARS-CoV-2 active metabolites with identical HPLC retention times, UV spectra, and masses (m/z = 336.1672). Structural elucidation by NMR and HR-MS identified these metabolites as the N 6 -modified adenosine derivative N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)adenosine (IPA) (Fig. S7) . Comparison of the natural compound to a commercial standard confirmed IPA as the active metabolite produced by both bacteria. Purified IPA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of Huh-7.5 cells with an IC 50 of 2 mM (Fig. 1b) , which is as potent or more potent than a number of repurposed drugs that have been explored as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, IC 50 , 2 mM; ribavirin, IC 50 , 30 mM; and favipiravir, IC 50 . 100 mM). Notably, IPA also displayed cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 ], 12 mM), something that is often observed with antiviral nucleoside analogues (20) .\n",
            " As IPA was the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolite we identified, we sought to probe its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in more detail. A common mode of action of nucleoside-based antivirals is incorporation into the product RNA strand by viral RNAdependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) (21, 22) . We, therefore, hypothesized that IPA might be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Nucleoside antivirals are prodrugs that must first be phosphorylated in vivo in order to function as RdRp substrates (23) . The ability of mammalian cells to phosphorylate IPA was examined by incubating HEK293 cells with IPA (10 mM, 3 h) and monitoring the intracellular concentration of the nucleoside and its phosphorylated derivative using negative ionization HR-MS. Similar to the control nucleoside antiviral remdesivir, we observed the appearance of IPA 59-monophosphate (p-IPA) in IPA-treated cells (Fig. 3a) , indicating that IPA, like other nucleoside antivirals, is phosphorylated by eukaryotic cells.\n",
            " Remdesivir, which is approved for the treatment of severe COVID-19, is efficiently incorporated as an ATP analog into the product RNA strand during SARS-CoV-2 RdRpcatalyzed RNA synthesis (24) . The resulting product RNA can then serve as the template strand, which, at intracellular nucleoside concentrations, leads to template-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (25) . To test if the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp can incorporate IPA into the product RNA strand, we synthetically triphosphorylated IPA to yield N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)ATP (ppp-IPA) (26) . In vitro RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp from a template RNA strand (27) (Fig. 3b ) was then used to assess the enzyme's ability to incorporate ppp-IPA. The corresponding triphosphate of remdesivir (ppp-RDV) was used as a positive control. In this assay, the addition of UTP to begin RNA synthesis of a \"AAUUUUAG. . .\"-containing template strand resulted in the formation of the 12 product (Fig. 3c, lane 2 ). Further addition of ATP formed the 17 product (Fig. 3c, lane 3) . Addition of the RNA chain terminator 39-dATP (dATP) forms a 13 product, though the full 17 product could be recovered by the simultaneous addition of ATP (Fig. 3c , lanes 4 to 5). Addition of either ppp-IPA or ppp-RDV resulted in the formation of the 17 RNA product whether ATP was present or not, confirming that ppp-IPA, like ppp-RDV (24), is successfully incorporated into the growing RNA product as an ATP analog by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Fig. 3c , lanes 6 to 9; Fig. S8 ). IPA may have other targets beyond the viral RdRp. Certain N 6 -modified nucleosides, for example, can interfere with canonical base pairing (28) . This provides an alternate mechanism for viral inhibition, with a buildup of mutations resulting in lethal mutagenesis, as seen with other nucleoside antivirals such as ribavirin (29) . Mutagenesis as a result of base pair mismatching could also help explain the cytotoxicity exhibited by IPA. Additionally, although nucleoside antivirals are best known for being incorporated by RNA polymerase, other targets, such as RNA capping enzymes, exist (30) and cannot be ruled out as possible targets of IPA. While the incorporation of IPA during SARS-CoV-2-mediated RNA synthesis does not preclude the possibility that it may be imparting antiviral activity through other pathways, it is nonetheless interesting that the naturally occurring nucleoside antiviral IPA can, like the clinically used antiviral remdesivir, be readily incorporated during RNA synthesis.\n",
            " Structure-activity relationship of microbiome-derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolites. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of each anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolite was explored using collections of naturally occurring related structures. For IPA, we tested adenine and adenosine, as well as several N-modified adenine and adenosine derivatives (Fig. S9a) . None of these, including the closely related trans-zeatin riboside, displayed antiviral activity (IC 50 . 250 mM) ( Table 1) . Although diverse nucleoside structures are used as antivirals, IPA appears to have unique anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity among closely related, naturally occurring nucleosides. We explored the SAR of tryptamine's anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity using a panel of natural tryptamine analogs, as well as the structurally related trace amines tyramine and phenylethylamine, all of which are known bacterial metabolites (Fig. S9b ) (31) (32) (33) . While both natural (e.g., bufotenine) and synthetic (e.g., 5-NT) tryptamine derivatives have been reported to have antiviral activity (18, 34, 35) , among the closely related bacterial metabolites we tested, tryptamine was uniquely active against SARS-CoV-2. 2,5-Disubstituted pyrazines arise from the coupling of two amino acids (36) , and thus, the production of a large number of disubstituted pyrazines is possible from proteinogenic amino acids. As the anti-SARS-CoV-2 active pyrazine BIP contained two indole groups, we focused our SAR analysis on testing the relevance of indole to antiviral activity. To do this, we synthesized the phenylalanine-derived analogs of BIP and IMP, 2,5-bis(phenylmethyl)pyrazine (BPP) and 2-(phenylmethyl)-5-methylpyrazine (PMP), and assayed them for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Neither was active in the concentration range we tested (Table 1 ; Fig. S9c ). Once again, the naturally occurring compound we isolated was the most active among the closely related structures we tested.\n",
            " Activity against other viruses. We tested all three microbiome-derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolites for activity against a panel of RNA viruses, including the seasonal coronavirus HCoV-229E, yellow fever virus 17D (YFV 17D), and human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV-3). These are representative of both positive-sense single-strand RNA (1ssRNA) viruses (HCoV-229E, YFV 17D) and negative-sense single-strand RNA (2ssRNA) viruses (hPIV-3). As with SARS-CoV-2, all viral infections were carried out using Huh-7.5 cells.\n",
            " IPA displayed broad antiviral activity (IC 50 , 2 to 13 mM). It was most potent against the three 1ssRNA viruses (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, and YFV 17D) with roughly the same IC 50 (2 mM to 4 mM) against each (Fig. 4a) . Although less potent, it also inhibited infection by the lone 2ssRNA virus we tested, hPIV-3 (IC 50 , 13 mM). Tryptamine showed a narrower spectrum of activity (Fig. 4b) . It was most active against the two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 (IC 50 , 33 mM) and HCoV-229E (IC 50 , 50 mM), and less effective against the 2ssRNA virus hPIV-3 (IC 50 218 mM). Despite also being a 1ssRNA virus, tryptamine was almost five times less active against YFV 17D (IC 50 , 158 mM) than it was against SARS-CoV-2. Like IPA, BIP displayed similar antiviral activity against the three 1ssRNA viruses, with IC 50 s of 12, 20, and 70 mM against HCoV-229E, YFV 17D, and SARS-CoV-2, respectively (Fig. 4c) . It was inactive against the only 2ssRNA virus, hPIV-3. Among IPA, tryptamine, and BIP, tryptamine was unique in its ability to preferably inhibit coronavirus infections.\n",
            " Production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolites by commensal strains and the human microbiome. Contrary to what has traditionally been seen in the search for bioactive small molecules from bacteria derived from other ecosystems (e.g., soil), IPA and tryptamine are not specialized metabolites that arise from complex and rare biosynthetic gene clusters. Similar to many of the bioactive molecules that have been characterized from the human microbiota (37, 38), these metabolites instead arise from primary metabolic and catabolic pathways. To look for production of antiviral metabolites by other commensal bacteria, we used HR-MS to track the presence of these metabolites in the 50 culture broth extracts we originally screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity ( Fig. 5 ; Table S1 ). In the case of IPA, in addition to the two strains from which it was originally characterized, it was also produced in a high titer by Bacteroides fragilis CL07T00C01. IPA was produced at a detectable level most frequently by strains from the Bacteroidetes phylum, with half of the Bacteroidetes strains we examined producing IPA. The frequent production of IPA by Bacteroidetes strains was surprising given that previous reports of bacteria producing high levels IPA, other than as a tRNA constituent, are quite rare (39) . Tryptamine is a commonly identified metabolite in human fecal samples (17) . Among the strains we examined, it was produced in the highest titer by R. gnavus but was also detected at lower levels in extracts from a number of other bacteria ( Fig. 5) . Although taxonomically diverse bacteria, including Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes (36, 40, 41) , have been reported to produce smaller pyrazine-based natural products, and contrary to IPA and tryptamine, which are produced by a number of bacteria in our collection, BIP and IMP were only produced at detectable levels by M. luteus. While tryptamine is ubiquitous in human stool samples, the production of IPA, BIP, and IMP by the human microbiome is not well described. To probe for the in vivo production of these metabolites, we looked for tandem mass spectra matching IPA, BIP, or IMP in metabolite extract data from fecal and tissue samples submitted to the GNPS, an open-access metabolomics repository (42) . In a number of fecal and tissue samples collected from both mice and humans, we identified tandem mass spectra matching IPA. The detection of IPA in these samples suggests that its production by microbiome-derived bacteria in the laboratory was not merely a by-product of in vitro fermentation methods. One human fecal data set was found to contain a spectral match to BIP and IMP. The rarity of these metabolites in stool samples may be explained by a lack of bacterial producers that are native to the gut. Among the strains we examined, the only producing strain, M. luteus, is not found in the gut but, rather, is an aerobic bacterium commonly observed in the skin microbiome (43) .\n",
            " In our survey of culture broth extracts from bacteria isolated from human samples, we identified three structurally diverse metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Of the metabolites we identified, IPA displayed the most potent antiviral activity, and tryptamine, while less potent, was effective in the concentration range commonly seen in the human gut. All three metabolites are either structurally and/or functionally related to synthetic FDA-approved drugs that have been tested in either COVID-19 clinical trials or observational studies (Fig. 6 ). IPA is a constituent of bacterial tRNA (39), and very low titers of IPA (4 to 12 mg/liter) have been observed in cultures of a small number of bacterial plant symbiotes (44, 45) . Interestingly, P. nigrescens produces more than 500 mg/liter of IPA. Free IPA is best known as a plant cytokinin (46) and has been reported to inhibit enterovirus 71 (EV-71) infection in cell culture (47) ; however, to the best of our knowledge, neither the production of IPA by human commensal bacteria nor its activity toward SARS-CoV-2 was known.\n",
            " Tryptamine is a known bacterial agonist of the 5-HTR family of GPCRs. In a smallscale randomized clinical trial, fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is typically used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, was associated with improved COVID-19 outcomes (9). In addition, in a retrospective study of patients taking antipsychotic and antidepressant serotonin 2A receptor antagonists (e.g., trazadone, mirtazapine), taking these drugs was associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 infections (48) . While the mechanisms that explain these observations remain to be determined, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity observed for modulators of 5- HTR signaling suggests that it will be interesting to explore the potential antiviral effects of modulating this signaling pathway through engineering of the microbiome.\n",
            " BIP is a pyrazine-based antiviral produced only by M. luteus among the strains we examined. Small pyrazines like 2,5-dimethylpyrazine have been reported to have antifungal activity, while the larger, indole-containing BIP has been reported to be inactive as an antimicrobial (40, 49) . The biosynthesis of small pyrazines is relatively common in nature (50) , and opportunistic human pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and Serratia marcescens have been reported to produce small pyrazines as potential signaling molecules (51, 52) . Indole-bearing pyrazines have only been observed a few times in nature (40) . In one case, both BIP and IMP were reported as products of a Brevibacillus laterosporus strain that was cultured from the ear of a feral hog (41) . The identification of BIP and IMP from M. luteus, a commonly observed human skin commensal, is, to our knowledge, both the first example of indole-containing pyrazines being produced by a human microbiome-derived bacterium and the first report of BIP having antiviral activity. As these metabolites have not been previously reported from the human microbiome, we do not know if they ever accumulate at significant quantities physiologically.\n",
            " Any potential ecological role of these metabolites in a complex host, microbiome, and virus tripartite interaction remains to be determined. However, the similarity between commensal antiviral metabolites and FDA-approved antivirals is intriguing and unexpected. Our identification of metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity suggests that the human microbiota may encode a reservoir of small molecules with antiviral activity and that continued screening of commensal bacterial extracts should be a fruitful strategy for identifying additional antiviral small molecules.\n",
            " Chemicals, cell lines, and viral strains. IPA and tryptamine standards were obtained from Cayman Chemical and Alfa Aesar, respectively. All bacterial strains were obtained from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH, as part of the Human Microbiome Project (13) . Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells (Homo sapiens; sex, male; liver epithelial) (53) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Cells have been authenticated and tested negative for contamination with mycoplasma. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020; BEI Resources) and HCoV-229E were amplified and titrated by standard plaque assay (PA) in Huh-7.5 cells (54) . The generation of viral stocks for additional viruses has been previously described as follows: hPIV-3 (55) (based on strain JS) and YFV 17D Venus (56) (derived from YF17D-59C25Venus2AUbi).\n",
            " Bacterial fermentations. All bacteria were cultivated in LBM media (17 g/liter brain heart infusion, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 200 mg MgSO 4 Á7H 2 O, 100 mg/liter MnCl 2 Á4H 2 O, 5 mg/liter hemin, 1 g/liter maltose, 1 g/liter cellobiose, and 0.5 g/liter L-cysteine). Bacterial fermentations were performed aerobically or anaerobically for each individual strain. For aerobic fermentations, the bacterial glycerol stock provided by BEI was used to inoculate 10 ml of LBM. This culture was grown for 24 to 48 h at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm, and once, turbid was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh LBM media in a 3-liter baffled Fernbach flask. The culture was fermented for 7 days at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm, followed by metabolite extraction as described below. All anaerobic fermentations were performed in a 37°C incubator placed inside vinyl anaerobic chamber (Coy) with a gas mix of 5% CO 2 , 5% H 2 , and 90% N 2 . The bacterial glycerol stock provided by BEI was used to inoculate 10 ml of LBM. This culture was grown for 24 to 48 h, and once, turbid was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh LBM media in a 1-liter glass bottle (Chemglass). Fermentation proceeded anaerobically for 7 days at 37°C followed by metabolite extraction as described below.\n",
            " Small molecule extraction and prefractionation. Amberlite XAD7HP resin (Sigma) was activated by soaking in methanol for 15 min, followed by washing five times with deionized water. Resin was stored in water until needed. Twenty grams of activated Amberlite resin was added to 1 liter of a cell suspension of bacterial culture and incubated with shaking (200 rpm) at room temperature for 4 h. Resin was then collected by filtration. We added 300 ml of acetone (Sigma), and this mixture was shaken for 2 h at room temperature. The acetone elution was collected, and an equal volume of fresh acetone was added and allowed to incubate with the resin overnight at room temperature. This second acetone elution was combined with the first and dried in vacuo on a rotary evaporator (Buchi) to afford a crude metabolite extract.\n",
            " Each extract was resuspended in methanol (Sigma) to a concentration of 100 mg/ml. One milliliter (100 mg) of this solution was aliquoted and diluted in water to 5% methanol and spun down to prepare for fractionation on a Strata C 18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge (500 mg, 3 ml; Phenomenex). The SPE cartridge was activated with two column volumes of methanol followed by washing with two column volumes of water. The crude extract was then passed over the column, and the flowthrough (fraction F1) was collected. Metabolites were then eluted (two column volumes) using a stepwise gradient of increasing methanol concentrations as follows: F2, 30%; F3, 70%; and F4, 100%. These elutions, along with the column flowthrough, were dried in vacuo, affording four prefractionated extracts from each crude metabolite pool.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. The day prior to infection, Huh-7.5 cells were seeded at 7.5 Â 10 3 cells/ well into 96-well plates. The next day, serially diluted compounds were added to the wells, followed 1 h later by infections with either SARS-CoV-2 (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 0.05 PFU/cell), HCoV-229E (MOI, 0.05 PFU/cell), YFV 17D Venus (MOI, 0.025 PFU/cell), or hPIV-3-GFP (MOI, 0.05 IU/cell). Cells were incubated for 48 h at 33°C for infections performed with SARS-CoV-2 and at 37°C for infections performed with other viruses. Cells were then fixed by adding an equal volume of 7% formaldehyde to the wells and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After extensive washing, SARS-CoV-2-and HCoV-229E-infected cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution of 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (catalog no. 005-000-121; Jackson ImmunoResearch). A rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (catalog no. GTX135357; GeneTex) was added to the cells at 1:1,000 dilution in blocking solution and incubated at 4°C overnight. J2, a mouse monoclonal anti-double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) antibody (catalog no. 10010500; Scicons) was added to the cells under similar conditions to detect HCoV-229E-infected cells. Goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (catalog no. A-11012; Life Technologies) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (catalog no. A-11001; Life Technologies) were used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:2,000. Nuclei for all infections, including those with the fluorescently labeled YFV 17D and hPIV-3, were stained with Hoechst 33342 (catalog no. 62249; Thermo Scientific) at 1 mg/ml. Next, images were acquired with an ImageXpress XLS Widefield High-Content microscope (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Images were acquired using the DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) filter (excitation, 377 nm, and emission, 447 nm) for Hoechst staining and the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter (excitation, 482 nm, and emission, 536 nm) for viral nucleocapsid staining. Images were analyzed using an automated custom module in the MetaXpress software (Molecular Devices). Default software analysis scripts were used for DAPI-and FITC-positive cell counting. Infection was calculated as the percentage of viable cells that were positive for viral nucleocapsid. For determining the efficacy of isolated metabolites, 10-point doseresponse curves in a 1:3 dilution series were tested in triplicate using a maximum concentration of 50 mM (IPA) or 250 mM (tryptamine, BIP, and IMP). IC 50 values were calculated using a variable-slope, four-parameter nonlinear regression curve fit (GraphPad Prism 8). All SARS-CoV-2 experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.\n",

The medium was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of fresh DMEM containing either IPA or remdesivir at 10 mM. After 3 h, cells were harvested. The medium was removed, and plates were immediately placed on ice. Ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) was used to wash each well twice, and then, 500 ml extraction solution (80% CH 3 OH/ H 2 O, 5% formic acid, and 10 mM oligomycin standard, prechilled at 280°C for .1 h) was added to each well. Cells were allowed to lyse for 15 min on ice. Each well was then scraped with a sterile cell scraper, and the lysate was transferred to an Eppendorf tube. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 Â g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred into preweighed 4-ml glass vials and dried in vacuo without heat (CentriVap; Labconco). Dried material was resuspended in 200 ml 50:25:25 H 2 O/CH 3 CN/CH 3 OH and centrifuged at 16,000 Â g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were moved into 96-well polypropylene plates, covered with slit silicone mats, and stored at 220°C until analysis by HR-MS.\n",
            " Chemical synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates. Trimethyl phosphate (0.5 ml, stored over 4-Å molecular sieves) (0.5 ml) was added to IPA (0.05 mmol) over 4-Å molecular sieves. The mixture was stirred for 24 h under an argon atmosphere. Phosphorus oxychloride (0.0070 ml, 0.075 mmol) was added via syringe, and the mixture was stirred for 3 h at 0°C. A mixture of tributylamine (0.060 ml, 0.25 mmol) and tributylammonium pyrophosphate (0.25 mmol, 90.8 mg) dissolved in acetonitrile (0.25 ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min at 0°C. The reaction was quenched by addition of triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) (1 M) (0.5 ml) and water (5 ml). The reaction mixture was purified by HPLC using the conditions described above with the following solvent gradient: 0 to 4 min, 5% B; 4 to 30 min, increase to 60% B; 35 to 40 min, increase to 95% B; and 40 to 50 min, 9% B. The identity of the IPA 59-triphosphate was confirmed by HR-MS.\n",

RNA primer (59-CGCGUAGCAUGCUACGUCAUUCUCC UAAGAAGCUA-39) was labeled at the 59 end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [g 32 -P]ATP (PerkinElmer). The labeling reaction was heat inactivated at 70°C for 20 min, and unincorporated [g 32 -P] ATP was removed with a 7 molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) Zeba spin column (Thermo Fisher). The labeled RNA primer was then annealed to the template strand (59-CUAUCCCCAUGUGA UUUUAAUAGCUUCUUAGGAGAAUGACGUAGCAUGCUACGCG-39; Horizon Discovery) by heating to 95°C for 2 min and cooling to 10°C for 30 min. Proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex were purified as previously reported (27, 57) . Nsp12 was incubated with 2.5-fold molar excess of Nsp7 and Nsp8 at room temperature for 15 min and buffer exchanged into transcription buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mM K-acetate, 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) through a 7 MWCO Zeba Spin desalting column (Thermo Fisher). The holo-complex (1.25 mM) was incubated with the RNA scaffold (1 mM) at 37°C for 15 min before the addition of NTPs and inhibitors (50 mM) 39-deoxyadenosine-59-triphosphate (TriLink), remdesivir triphosphate (Gilead Sciences), and isopentenyl ATP in 10-ml reactions. In vitro transcription reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 10 min before being quenched with an equal volume of 2Â stop buffer (95% [vol/vol] formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue, and xylene cyanol). Elongation products were separated on 15% acrylamide-6 M urea denaturing gel alongside Decade RNA ladder (Thermo Fisher) in 1Â Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) and analyzed by phosphorimaging.\n",

            "Title: The Importance of Glycans of Viral and Host Proteins in Enveloped Virus Infection\n",
            "Body Text: Animal viruses are parasites of animal cells that have characteristics such as heredity and replication, and are mainly composed of DNA or RNA, proteins and in some, a lipid membrane with glycoproteins (1) . Commonly, viruses achieve invasion and infection with the help of the synthetic machinery of host cells. Viruses can be divided into two groups depending on whether they have a lipid bilayer membrane on their outer surface or not: enveloped viruses and nonenveloped viruses. Enveloped viruses have a lipid bilayer that comes from the host cell. It incorporates receptor attachment proteins and membrane fusion proteins that are both encoded by the virus. And all attachment or fusion proteins of enveloped viruses are modified by glycosylation. Glycosylation is important for the life cycle of the virus and plays essential roles in stability, antigenicity and infectivity of viruses (2) . We summarize the functions of common enveloped viral glycoproteins in Table 1 .\n",
            " Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications of proteins, and there are two main types: N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation ( Figure 1 ). N-glycosylation means that Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in an oligosaccharide binds covalently to the polypeptide chain by an Nglycoside linkage with the amide nitrogen of an asparagine residue in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X is any amino acid other than proline). The main type of O-glycosylation is the mucin-type O-glycosylation, which means that N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) bonds covalently to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residues replacing the hydrogen in the hydroxyl group to form an (12) . The formation and extension of glycans requires the synergistic completion of two types of glycan processing enzymes, one is glycosyltransferase which catalyzes the formation of glycoside linkages, and another is glycosidase which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycoside linkages (13) .\n",
            " The entry of a virus into a host cell is closely related to the glycans on its own structural proteins. The glycoproteins of some viruses play an important role in host infection, especially in the recognition of the host cell and the interaction with other molecules in the cell after the attachment (14) . Furthermore, due to the fact that viruses can fully depend on cellular host cells These viral glycoprotein are classified as: (1) GP, glycoprotein; (2) HA, hemagglutinin; (3) E, enveloped proteins; (4) prM, premembrane; (5) S, spike protein.\n",
            " FIGURE 1 | Glycoconjugates that formed by carbohydrates are covalently bonded to proteins and lipids on mammalian cell membranes. Proteins can be glycosylated and covalently bound to a polypeptide chain via an N-glycoside linkage to Asn or via an O-glycoside linkage to Ser/Thr. N-linked glycans share a common pentasaccharide core structure, which is composed of two GlcNAc and three mannoses. The main type of O-linked glycosylation is the mucin-type Oglycosylation, which has N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) as a common core. Glycosphingolipids are ubiquitous molecules that formed via the covalent linkage between a glycan moiety and a ceramide.\n",
            " for their reproduction, thus, they must complete glycosylation with the help of host glycoprotein synthesis mechanism (1, 15) . Viral glycoproteins are involved in many important biological processes, such as protein folding and stabilization, viral infection and invasion, recognition of host receptors and immune escape of the virus from the immune system (16) .\n",
            " With the development of glycan-related research technology, the research and development of novel virus vaccines and antiviral drugs modified by glycosylation are receiving increasing attention. In this review, we will explore the effects of glycosylation of host and virus proteins on virus biological behavior, with the aim of providing a reference for the prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases.\n",
            " The life cycle of enveloped viruses includes the processes of adsorption, penetration, uncoating, biosynthesis, assembly and release. Figure 2 summarizes the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.\n",
            " Viral replication depends on successful infection of the host cells. The replication cycle starts with a virus particle attaching to a specific receptor on the surface of a host cell, and viral entry can be realized by endocytosis (non-enveloped or enveloped viruses), membrane fusion (enveloped viruses) or direct fusion with the plasma membrane (20, 21) . After internalization, the capsid is released into the cytoplasm with negative strand viruses, it is uncoating the nucleocapsid, which will be copied to produce the antigenome which itself is then used to transcribe many copies of the genome, or mRNA that are translated into viral proteins (17, 18) . The viral glycopeptides are translated on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where the N-linked glycans are added and transported through the Golgi complex where the N-linked glycans are modified and the O-glycans are added (22, 23) . At the same time, the viral genome with its associated proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus, where they are released outside the cell by exocytosis after maturation (24) . Glycoproteins are essential for the infectivity of the virions that have them.\n",
            " The glycoproteins in the membrane of enveloped viruses bind specifically to the receptors on the cell membrane and cause membrane fusion enabling virus contents to enter the cell. In this process, the surface glycans of the virus can be involved in initiating the recognition of host cells and thus affect the organs and the cells that in the organs. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is an enveloped virus, and its envelope contains of gp120 surface protein and gp41 transmembrane protein. Moreover, gp120 is one of the most highly glycosylated proteins in nature. It accounts for approximately 50% of the total mass (25) . These glycans not only affect the conformation of the envelope but also affect the entry and infectivity of the virus. It is generally believed that HIV-1 gp120 promotes viral entry by sequentially binding to CD4 and chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 on target cells (26) . However, there have been many reports that gp120 can bind to various cell types independently of CD4. Some HIV-1 isolates were able to infect CD4-negative but CCR5 expressing cells due to the deficiency of Asn 197 in gp120, which leads to the exposure of the CCR5-binding region of gp120, thus HIV-1 can enter cells (27) . Similarly, the binding of virus to CD4 was reduced significantly by removing the glycan chains from gp120 by endoglycosidase treatment or Nglycosylation site mutation (28, 29) . In contrast, in Vero cells, removing the N-glycan near the highly conserved receptor binding domain on the envelope glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus (EBOV) increased GP-mediated virus entry efficiency (30) . Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the surface glycoproteins of influenza A virus. Influenza virus attaches to the surface of a host cell when its HA protein interacts with the terminal sialic acid (SA) of the host cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids. On the other hand, NA can cleave SA residues from glycoproteins of the enveloped virus itself and enhance infectivity by preventing aggregation of virus particles (31) . NA may also act on the SA residues of host mucin to gain access to the epithelial cells, playing a secondary role in helping viruses to enter host cells (32) .\n",
            " One of the key roles of protein glycosylation is its effect on folding, structure, transport, and stability (33) . Glycans can be structurally integrated into protein folding, and the interaction between the glycan and protein could stabilize the protein. Besides, glycans can also assist glycoprotein folding in the biosynthetic process by mediating interactions with chaperones (34) . Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) act as chaperones to facilitate the correct folding of viral proteins. In cells, when all nascent N-glycans added to a protein, they have three terminal glucose residues. These residues will be removed sequentially, with a -glucosidase I (aGI) removing the outermost glucose residue and a-glucosidase II (aGII) removing the next two residues produce the immature GlcMan9GlcNAc2 N-glycans (35) . CNX and CRT have a lectin domain, and this domain can specifically bind to immature GlcMan 9 GlcNAc 2 N-glycans on misfolded proteins and recruit ATP, calcium, and protein disulfide isomerase A3 to promote the folding of glycoproteins, thereby regulating glycoprotein entry into the CNX/CRT folding cycle (36, 37) .\n",
            " Glycans on enveloped virus surface proteins can not only facilitate the folding of proteins but can also affect their transport. During HIV-1 replication, a high mannose type gp160 trimer assembles in the rough ER of host cells, and then gp160 is transported to the Golgi apparatus and cleaved by a furinlike protease in the late Golgi to its mature gp120 and gp41 proteins which remain associated (38, 39) . HIV-1 gp41 contains four N-glycosylation sites, removing of Asn 332 in gp41 can disrupt the proteolytic processing and the transportation of gpl60 (40, 41) . Herpes simplex viruses 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex viruses 2 (HSV-2) are globally prevalent pathogens, which often lead to recurrent oral and genital ulcers (42) . HSV encodes at least 12 different glycoproteins, and at least four of them are necessary and sufficient to mediate membrane fusion when they infect target cells, namely glycoprotein B (gB), gD, gH and gL (43) (44) (45) . Similarly, mutations of N390, N483 or N668 in total seven potential N-glycosylation sites on gB of HSV-2 can reduce the ability of cell-cell fusion and virus entry. However, the mutation of N133 mainly prevents the transport of gB from the ER to the Golgi, thus affecting protein expression and the production of infectious virions (46) .\n",
            " Enveloped viruses mainly release their progeny by budding. Their envelope is derived from the host cell membrane, and the glycan on viral proteins can affect the release of progeny virions. For example, gC of HSV-1 mediates the attachment of HSV-1 to susceptible host cells by interacting with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) on the cell surface. Also, gC contains a mucin-like domain (MLD) located near the GAG binding site, which may affect the binding activity between the virus and GAG. HSV-1 mutants that lack these MLDs in gC and found that compared with natural HSV-1, the binding affinity of virions to the cell was reduced and the release ability of mutant virus particles from the surface of infected cells was also reduced (47) . Similarly, glycosylation sites on the premembrane protein and enveloped proteins of West Nile virus (WNV) are cell typedependent or even species-dependent and affect the release of virus and infection efficiency (10) .\n",
            " Moreover, some viruses have even evolved glycosidases to promote virus release (48) . The most obvious example is that influenza virus NA cleaves SA residues from the surface of host cells, thereby reducing and weakening the ability of HA to bind to host cell glycoprotein receptors (49, 50) . During the process of virus budding from the cell plasma membrane, HA proteins continue to bind virions to SA residues on the cell surface until the NA sialidase activity removes terminal SA residues.\n",
            " During the process of viral evolution, viruses develop different glycosylation modifications, and N-glycosylation sites of proteins are added or deleted, these alterations can have an appreciable impact on the survival and transmissibility of a virus (16) . For example, adding an N-glycosylation site to the HA protein can increase the sensitivity of the respiratory system to innate immune protein production, and reduce the transmissibility of influenza A viruses (51) (52) (53) . Similarly, N-glycan of HIV gp120 is also of vital importance to viral infection and transmission (54) . The majority of HIV N-glycan deficient mutants show decreased infectivity and transmission efficiency (N156Q, N197Q, N332Q, N386Q), but two of the N-glycan mutants (N230Q and N295Q) show increased infectivity and transmission efficiency (54) . SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing a health crisis, the magnitude of which is rare in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 virus spike (S) glycoprotein is highly glycosylated, if the glycosylation sites of both N331 and N343 are mutated at the same time, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 can be significantly reduced, suggesting that their glycans are important for viral infectivity (55) .\n",
            " In addition, replication of the same virus in different cells can generate different glycosylation, which severely affects the transmission ability of the virus (56) . For example, HIV from different cell lines has different glycosylation in its envelope proteins, and the glycosylation difference affects its interaction with Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). HIV from T cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells was well bound and transmitted by DC-SIGN, whereas HIV from macrophages was poorly bound and transmitted (57, 58) .\n",
            " Enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1, influenza virus, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 are a great threat to humans. The envelope proteins of these viruses are heavily glycosylated, and these glycans can hide an antigenic epitope to thereby avoiding recognition by neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against that site and providing a convenient way for viruses to infect host cells and to promote immune escape. There are two main mechanisms by which viruses can escape the nAbs response.\n",
            " Despite major efforts to produce a vaccine for HIV-1, it is unfortunate that all of the traditional methods of vaccine preparation have generated little expected effect due to the great diversity of HIV-1 strains (59) . Only a minority of people produce nAbs after receiving HIV vaccines. Mutation of Asn 332 in gp120 after HIV infection and also nAbs that target this site were detected in the sera from two people who had responded to an HIV vaccine (a recombinant glycoprotein 120 vaccine), suggesting that HIV antigenic sites are blocked by glycans, resulting in most people failing to produce broadly nAbs (60) . Similarly, patients with acute HIV infection do not produce detectable nAbs until at least 52 days after infection. Hardly any mutations were detected in the envelope proteins of the viruses that successfully escaped after nAbs suppression, while an increase in N-glycosylation was detected (61) . Moreover, one of the two N-glycosylation sites of Ebola virus GP2 is mutated, which is very adverse to the antigenicity and immunogenicity of GP (62) . All of these observations illustrate that highly glycosylated modifications can shield the antigenic sites of the virus and present challenges to antiviral therapy.\n",
            " Antigenic drift is a small variation in antigens caused by mutations in the genome, without new subtypes generation, but it often promotes immune escape and leads to the greater scope of the spreading, which often occurs in influenza viruses. H1N1 broke out in 1918/1919, infecting nearly half of the world's population, with a mortality rate of 2.5%~5%, at least 50 million people died (63) . Ninety-one years later, in April 2009, the new H1N1 virus appeared and spread rapidly around the world, causing an estimated 280,000 deaths worldwide. Low immunity of the population to the novel H1N1 strain was the main reason that led to its mass epidemic. HA is an effective target for nAbs, and mutations in the antigenic sites in its globular head region promote the immune escape of the virus. A complete analysis of the amino acid sequence of the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses showed that the HA of these viruses can be glycosylated at the conserved glycosylation sites (64, 65) . It was reported that highly glycosylated seasonal Influenza A viruses are inactivated by soluble lectins of the innate immune system (66) . Compared with seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses, the HA globular regions of epidemic H1N1 are often modified by a low degree of glycosylation, which correlates with a greater difference at the amino acid level seen at or near the known antigenic sites located in the globular head of the HA (67, 68) . Furthermore, that only influenza (H1N1) shows antigenic drift compared to several other RNA viruses that infect the respiratory tract (69) . These antigenic drifts contribute to the immune escape of H1N1, contributing in part to the flu vaccine failing to provide protection (70) .\n",
            " There are many glycans in virus surface glycoproteins, and they affect the virulence of the virus by regulating the binding of the virus to host receptors, covering up antigenic sites, or stimulating host immune responses to affect virulence (71) . These glycans play different roles in the virulence of the virus.\n",
            " Rabies viruses (RABVs) are non-segmented, negativestranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae. The RABV genome encodes five structural proteins: nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, GP, and large transcriptase protein (9) . GP is the only viral transmembrane protein that is exposed on the virion surface that interacts and the target cell receptor. The GP of most RABVs has two N-glycosylation sites, Asn 37 and Asn 319 . The N-glycan at Asn 37 plays a role in promoting the propagation of the virus but also reduces the pathogenicity of the virus (53) . Similarly, the addition of a single N-glycan at Asn 194 or Asn 247 also reduced the pathogenicity of street rabies viruses, confirmed by peripheral infection in mice (72) . Furthermore, the virulence of H1N1 for mice decreased with an increase in the number of HA glycosylation sites (64) .\n",
            " On the other hand, the glycans of viral proteins can also enhance their virulence. For example, glycosylated and nonglycosylated E proteins of WNV are neurovirulent. However, viruses containing glycosylated E proteins are more neuroinvasive in BALB/c mice (73) . Otherwise, the adding N-glycosylation of amino acids at either 154 or 156 increase neuro-invasiveness in mice, avian virulence, and vector competence (74) .\n",
            " The specific binding of a virus to host receptor is a prerequisite for viral infection, and the viral glycans responsible for attachment and cell receptors of viruses play a decisive role. Many studies have focused on the functions of glycans on the viral protein: such as host cell recognition, replication, infection and immune escape. However, hosts and viruses have coevolutionary relationships, thus the functions of host receptors are also crucial, and all viruses must interact with the specific receptors when they enter a cell. The specificity of host receptors is considered to be one of the major factors in determining host range and tissue tropism. Host receptor refers to a component of the host cell membrane that can bind specifically to the virus, mediate virus entry, and promote virus infection. Its chemical nature is a glycoprotein, proteoglycan, lipid, or glycolipid (75, 76) . According to their different functions, virus receptors can be divided into two categories: attachment factors and entry receptors (77) . Entry receptors can bind to the virus and mediate the internalization of the virus, for example, HIV can bind to CD4. Attachment factors concentrate viruses on the cell surface and play an auxiliary role in the process of virus infection (78) . For example, heparin sulfate, which is proteoglycan widely found on various cell surfaces and extracellular matrix in the body, can act as an auxiliary receptor of SARS-CoV-2 to promote the entry of virus (79) . Therefore, glycans on a host cell receptor can play an important role in influencing viral infection as a functional receptor or attachment factor for the virus.\n",
            " SA is a naturally existing nine-carbon monosaccharide and has been identified as a functional receptor attached to the termini of N-glycans or O-glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids (80) . SA is one of the first sites for the contact between many pathogens and hosts because it presents on the outer surface of cells and mucosal tissues. SA carried by most mammals is called Nglycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) ( Figure 3A) ; however, our ancestors also evolved another kind of SA, called Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), probably to resist the malaria parasite that was able to use Neu5Gc to enter the human body at that time. After completing this evolution, making some diseases seem more particularly specific to humans, such as typhoid, cholera, mumps, pertussis, asthma, and coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) (81) . When SARS-CoV-2 enters the human body, it recognizes SA first, and search for its receptor at the same time, then it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), opening the access into the cell (82, 83) .\n",
            " Usually, SA exists as a bound sugar at the terminal positions of glycans via different glycosidic linkages (a2,3, a2,6, and a2,8) . Figure 3B shows common SA linkage types. SA can be found in almost all animals, but the virus cannot infect all animals that have SA. Besides, different viruses infect different hosts by employing different receptors, which may be determined by the diversification of SA residue linkage types ( Figure 3B) , that is, viruses have a specific selectivity in the process of infecting the host. For example, the influenza virus binds to the receptor by recognizing SA residue at the terminal position of the receptor glycoprotein glycan chain, but it has the preference for certain types of SA (such as Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac). The preferential binding property may be attributed to the changes in the penultimate galactose residue linkage to SA. Avian influenza virus mainly binds to a2,3-linked SA residue, while human influenza virus preferentially binds to a2,6-linked SA residue (84, 85) .\n",
            " Other glycans can also act as viral receptors to influence the entry of viruses, such as heparan sulfate, which can act as an initial adhesion receptors for various viruses, so it can help the virus adhere to the cells and mediate entry before the virus binds to the high-affinity receptors. HSV entry begins with the attachment of the virus to target cells through binding of HSV gC and/or gB to heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 or syndecan-2 of the epithelial cell surface. Then, via various cell surface receptors such as nectin-1 or nectin-2. Finally, the attached virus begins to enter the cells (86) (87) (88) . Like HSV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters cells by interacting with syndecan-1 or syndecan-4 on the surface of human hepatocytes to initiate its life cycle (89, 90) . As for HCV, its functional receptors include SRB1, CD81, CLDN1, and OCLN, among which CD81 is the most important (91) .\n",
            " Also, neutral glycans may act as virus receptors, such as histo-blood group antigens, which are present in red blood cells, epithelial cells, and mucosal secretions, and play an important role as attachment factors for Rotavirus and Norovirus (92, 93) .\n",
            " Faced with the threat of new viruses, the effective prevention measure that we can take is to control the source of infection, cut off the main route of transmission and protect the susceptible population, these measures will be essential to bring the situation under control and to alleviate the negative effects of the epidemic. The definitive solution is effective vaccines that induce uninfected people to generate protective antibody and build long-term immune memory to combat the virus if the vaccine ever comes in contact with that virus at a later time.\n",
            " Although we know that the envelope proteins in HIV are the only target for nAbs (94) , it is unfortunate that almost all of the traditional methods of vaccine preparation have generated little expected effect due to the great diversity of HIV-1 strains. Removal of the N-glycan modifications in the highly variable V1-V3 region of HIV-1 envelope protein improves the sensitivity of the virus to nAbs (95) . Similarly, the gp120 complex mutated at the glycosylation site N448E can activate antiviral immunity better than the gp120 wild type. This suggests that removing N-glycans can increase the effectiveness of HIV vaccine (3). However, the heterogeneity of the HIV envelope, viruses tend to escape from most neutralizing antibody responses. Currently, HIV vaccine development research is focused on inducing unique broadly nAbs to act on diverse strains of HIV-1.\n",
            " Because of the antigenic drift of influenza viruses, current influenza vaccines need to be updated annually. The number and length of glycans on HA can affect the immune response; reducing the length of glycans can induce nAbs to make a stronger immune response to antigenic epitopes (96) . The binding of nAbs to the HA glycans was inhibited at low temperature because the low temperature can stiffen the glycan structure (97) . Interestingly, increased density of viral glycans in oligosaccharide-modified influenza viruses can directly activate the immune response and there exists a class of conserved epitopes in influenza viruses, that after adding hyperglycosylated artificially will become dominant (It was verified by mice in vivo experiment) (98) . This finding suggests that further study on glycosylation of influenza virus HA protein can be helpful to develop antiviral drugs.\n",
            " Experimental vaccines against HSV-1 target particular viral glycoproteins. HSV envelope gD is expressed on the surface of the virus and induces a nAbs response. The largest current clinical trial of HSV subunit vaccines has found an inhibitory effect on HSV-1, but no effect against HSV-2 (99). A different attenuated vaccine strategy has been attempted by using HSV without glycoprotein D2, this vaccine can induce neutralizing antibody which displays antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity to achieve better protection from HSV infection (100, 101) .\n",
            " The GP of EBOV is the main target of nAbs. Most of the current research on Ebola vaccines uses GP as the immunogen. Mature GP is composed of GP1 and GP2. They are presented on the surface of virions as trimers of disulfide-linked GP1-GP2 heterodimers. The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap, and the MLD. The MLD is highly variable and contains both N-and O-linked glycans (30) . The MLD is essential for immune shielding, studies have shown that the MLD-deleted GP1 and GP2 can induce an immune response that may result in cross-species immunity (102) . Similarly, a subunit vaccine that contains the extracellular domain of the GP fused with the Fc fragment of human IgG1 to protect mice against EBOV lethal challenge (103). Further research found that mutation of Asn 565 on GP2 was highly detrimental to the immunogenicity of GP; However, mutation of two N-glycosylation sites on GP1 (388, 415 sites) may enhance immunogenicity (62) . Hence, the glycan on EBOV GP play an important role in inducing immunity, and further study of glycan may help us develop more effective vaccines.\n",
            " The S protein is the only antigen that is target of nAbs. The RNA vaccine that expecting S protein now aims to use all over the world. The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly glycosylated with 22 N-glycosylation sites (104) . However, in the face of mutant virus strains, existing vaccines are less effective (105, 106) . Deletion of the N331 and N343 glycosylation sites of SARS-CoV-2 S protein could significantly reduce the ability of the virus to infect, and mutations of N234Q and N165Q could markedly resist to nAbs and be more sensitive, respectively (55) . The functional study of different glycosylation sites on S protein may provide references for the development of effective vaccines and drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in the future.\n",
            " Glycans can affect the host cell recognition, replication, infection and immune escape of virus. With the deepening understanding of the structure and function of enveloped virus glycoproteins, research and development of antibody drugs that target enveloped virus glycoproteins have become a current hot topic (94) . Studies have shown that lectins can inhibit HIV-1 infection by binding directly to the viral glycans, thereby disrupting the receptor-induced conformational changes, inhibiting membrane fusion, and blocking the binding of DC-SIGN (107) (108) (109) . In addition, tetherin is a protein molecule on the surface of human cells that can block the spread of HIV and inhibit the release of a broad-spectrum of enveloped viruses by retaining virions on the surface of the infected cell. It has been reported that the antiviral activity of tetherin is related to its glycosylation. Human tetherin contains two putative N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn 65 and Asn 92 ), and glycosylation of at least one Asn of tetherin is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of HIV-1 release (110) . The use of mannosidase-I inhibitor such as kifunensine inhibits the biosynthesis of Nglycan and enhances proteolysis of S proteins, which reduces receptor-binding domain presentation on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, lowers the binding to host ACE2 and decrease viral entry (111) . In addition, other N-glycosylation inhibitors, like swainsonine, which is mannosidase II inhibitor and has been shown to be safe in humans, can cause N-glycan truncation may be used to reduce viral entry (112) . Iminosugars are known inhibitors of aGI and aGII, like celgosivir, castanospermine, and UV-4, which can effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture (113) . These drugs and compounds may be used to reduce viral load and moderate SARS-CoV-2 related respiratory symptoms.\n",
            " Other potential inhibitors that may modulate viral entry include carbohydrate-based small molecules (e.g. 4F-GlcNAC, 4F-GalNAC) and acceptor decoys (e.g. ONAP, SNAP) are used by interfering with the mutual recognition process of glycan and lectin (114) .\n",
            " Historically, viral diseases have repeatedly caused large-scale global public health concerns and threats to human health and survival. Figure 4 illustrates the transmission pathway of several common viruses that infect humans. Increasing evidence shows that the alterations in the N-glycan profile and sugar recognition pattern in host cells can reflect the progress of viral infection to some extent and are expected to be a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of viral infection (116) . In short, glycosylation can be a tool for the virus to infect the host and escape host immunity. Here, we have summarized the progress in studying the effects of glycan on viral behavior in recent decades, which will provide new insights for the development of viral vaccines and help to develop new targets to protect against these viruses. Finally, faced with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we need to identify the key therapeutic targets including glycosylation sites in vaccines and drug targets. With the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, although we have effective countermeasures, the mutated version of the virus still threatens the health safety of mankind. In general, the existing vaccines are still effective against the mutated virus, but the neutralization efficiency is lower (106) . How to develop a more effective vaccine has become an urgent task at present. As one of the most important post-translational modifications, glycosylation is an indispensable factor in virus function. Glycosylation inhibitors can significantly inhibit viral infection and reduce the synthesis of viral proteins (117) . We need to design a new vaccine virus by researching the glycosylation sites that have an impact on the viability of the virus, and modifying the glycosylation of the virus (118) . Similarly, it is also very important to study SARS-CoV-2 S glycans differ from typical host glycan processing and develop targeted glycosylation inhibitors. In addition, the use of this inhibitor in combination with other types of antiviral drugs may have a better effect in combating viral infection, replication and overcoming viral resistance (119).\n",

            "Body Text: Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Many infectious diseases are also contagious, which means the infection can be transmitted from one person to another when there is some interaction (e.g., physical proximity) between them. Today, we live in an interconnected world where such contagious diseases could spread through social contact networks to become global public health hazards. A recent example of this phenomenon is the Covid-19 outbreak caused by the so-called novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has spread to many countries Zhu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020) . This recent global outbreak has caused serious social and economic repercussions, such as massive restrictions on movement and share market decline (Chinazzi et al., 2020) . It is therefore of great practical relevance to investigate the transmission of contagious diseases through social contact networks from the perspective of statistical inference.\n",
            " Consider an infection being transmitted through a population of n individuals. According to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model of disease spread, the pathogen can be transmitted from an infected person (I) to a susceptible person (S) with an infection rate given by β, and an infected individual becomes recovered (R) with a recovery rate given by µ. This can be modeled as a Markov chain whose state at time t is given by a vector (X t 1 , . . . , X t n ), where X t i denotes the state of the i th individual at time t, i.e., X t i ∈ {S, I, R}. For the population of n individuals, the state space of this Markov chain becomes extremely large with 3 n possible configurations, which makes it impractical to study the exact system. This problem was addressed in a series of three seminal papers by Kermack and McKendrick (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927 , 1932 , 1933 . Instead of modeling the disease state of each individual at at a given point of time, they proposed compartmental models, where the goal is to model the number of individuals in a particular disease state (e.g., susceptible, infected, recovered) at a given point of time. Since their classical papers, there has been a tremendous amount of work on compartmental modeling of contagious diseases over the last ninety years (Hethcote, 2000; Van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002; Brauer et al., 2012) .\n",
            " Compartmental models make the unrealistic assumption of homogeneity, i.e., each individual is assumed to have the same probability of interacting with any other individual. In reality, individuals interact with each other in a highly heterogeneous manner, depending upon various factors such as age, cultural norms, lifestyle, weather, etc. The contagion process can be significantly impacted by heterogeneity of interactions Rocha et al., 2011; Galvani and May, 2005; Woolhouse et al., 1997) , and therefore compartmental modeling of contagious diseases can lead to substantial errors.\n",
            " In recent years, contact networks have emerged as a preferred alternative to compartmental models (Keeling, 2005) . Here, a node represents an individual, and an edge between two nodes represent social contact between them. An edge connecting an infected node and a susceptible node represents a potential path for pathogen transmission. This framework can realistically represent the heterogeneous nature of social contacts, and therefore provide much more accurate modeling of the contagion process than compartmental models. Notable examples where the use of contact networks have led to improvements in prediction or understanding of infectious diseases include Bengtsson et al. (2015) and Kramer et al. (2016) .\n",
            " Consider the scenario where a pathogen is introduced into a social contact network and it spreads according to an SIR model. It is of particular interest to know whether the pathogen will die out or lead to an epidemic. This is dictated by a set of boundary conditions known as the epidemic threshold, which depends on the SIR parameters β and µ as well as the network structure itself. Above the epidemic threshold, the pathogen invades and infects a finite fraction of the population. Below the epidemic threshold, the prevalence (total number of infected individuals) remains infinitesimally small in the limit of large networks (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015) . There is growing evidence that such thresholds exist in real-world host-pathogen systems, and intervention strategies are formulated and executed based on estimates of the epidemic threshold. (Dallas et al., 2018; Shulgin et al., 1998; Wallinga et al., 2005; Pourbohloul et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 2005) . Fittingly, the last two decades have seen a significant emphasis on studying epidemic thresholds of contact networks from several disciplines, such as computer science, physics, and epidemiology (Newman, 2002; Wang et al., 2003; Colizza and Vespignani, 2007; Chakrabarti et al., 2008; Gómez et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016 . See Leitch et al. (2019) for a complete survey on the topic of epidemic thresholds.\n",
            " Concurrently but separately, network data has rapidly emerged as a significant area in statistics. Over the last two decades, a substantial amount of methodological advancement has been accomplished in several topics in this area, such as community detection (Bickel and Chen, 2009; Zhao et al., 2012; Rohe et al., 2011; Sengupta and Chen, 2015) , model fitting and model selection (Hoff et al., 2002; Handcock et al., 2007; Krivitsky et al., 2009; Wang and Bickel, 2017; Yan et al., 2014; Bickel and Sarkar, 2016; Sengupta and Chen, 2018) , hypothesis testing (Ghoshdastidar and von Luxburg, 2018; Tang et al., 2017a,b; Bhadra et al., 2019) , and anomaly detection (Zhao et al., 2018; Sengupta, 2018; Komolafe et al., 2019) , to name a few. The state-of-the-art toolbox of statistical network inference includes a range of random graph models and a suite of estimation and inference techniques.\n",
            " However, there has not been any work at the intersection of these two areas, in the sense that the problem of estimating epidemic thresholds has not been investigated from the perspective of statistical network inference. Furthermore, the task of computing the epidemic threshold based on existing results can be computationally infeasible for massive networks. In this paper, we address these gaps by developing a novel sampling-based method to estimate the epidemic threshold under the widely used Chung-Lu model (Aiello et al., 2000) , also known as the configuration model. We prove that our proposed method has theoretical guarantees for both statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. We also provide empirical results demonstrating our method on both synthetic and real-world networks.\n",
            " The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formally set up the prob-lem statement and formulate our proposed methods for approximating the epidemic threshold. In Section 3, we desribe the theoretical properties of our estimators. In Section 4, we report numerical results from synthetic as well as real-world networks. We conclude the paper with discussion and next steps in Section 5. Definition and Description λ(A) spectral radius of the matrix A d i degree of the node i of the network δ i expected degree of the node i of the network S(t), I(t), R(t) number of susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered/removed (R) individuals in the population at time t β infection rate: probability of transmission of a pathogen from an infected individual to a susceptible individual per effective contact (e.g. contact per unit time in continuous-time models, or per time step in discrete-time models) µ recovery rate: probability that an infected individual will recover per unit time (in continuous-time models) or per time step (in discrete-time models)\n",
            " Consider a set of n individuals labelled as 1, . . . , n, and an undirected network (with no self-loops) representing interactions between them. This can represented by an nby-n symmetric adjacency matrix A, where A(i, j) = 1 if individuals i and j interact and A(i, j) = 0 otherwise. Consider a pathogen spreading through this contact network according to an SIR model. From existing work (Chakrabarti et al., 2008; Gómez et al., 2010; Prakash et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016 , we know that the boundary condition for the pathogen to become an epidemic is given by\n",
            " where λ(A) is the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix A.\n",
            " The left hand side of Equation (1) is the ratio of the infection rate to the recovery rate, which is purely a function of the pathogen and independent of the network. As this ratio grows larger, an epidemic becomes more likely, as new infections outpace recoveries. The right hand side of Equation (1) is the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix, which is purely a function of the network and independent of the pathogen. Larger the spectral radius, the more connected the network, and therefore an epidemic becomes more likely. Thus, the boundary condition in Equation (1) connects the two aspects of the contagion process, the pathogen transmissibility which is quantified by β/µ, and the social contact network which is quantified by the spectral radius. If β µ < 1 λ(A) , the pathogen dies out, and if β µ > 1 λ(A) , the pathogen becomes an epidemic. Given a social contact network, the inverse of the spectral radius of its adjacency matrix represents the epidemic threshold for the network. Any pathogen whose transmissiblity ratio is greater than this threshold is going to cause an epidemic, whereas any pathogen whose transmissiblity ratio is less than this threshold is going to die out. Therefore, a key problem in network epidemiology is to compute the spectral radius of the social contact network.\n",
            " Realistic urban social networks that are used in modeling contagion processes have millions of nodes (Eubank et al., 2004; Barrett et al., 2008) . To compute the epidemic threshold of such networks, we need to find the largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix A. This is challenging because of two reasons.\n",
            " 1. First, from a computational perspective, eigenvalue algorithms have computational complexity of Ω(n 2 ) or higher. For massive social contact networks with millions of nodes, this can become too burdensome.\n",
            " 2. Second, from a statistical perspective, eigenvalue algorithms require the entire adjacency matrix for the full network of n individuals. It can be challenging or expensive to collect interaction data of n individuals of a massive population (e.g., an urban metropolis). Furthermore, eigenvalue algorithms typically require the full matrix to be stored in the random-access memory of the computer, which can be infeasible for massive social contact networks which are too large to be stored.\n",
            " The first issue could be resolved if we could compute the epidemic threshold in a computationally efficient manner. The second issue could be resolved if we could compute the epidemic threshold only using data on a small subset of the population. In this paper, we aim to resolve both issues by developing two approximation methods for computing the spectral radius.\n",
            " To address these problems, let us look at the spectral radius, λ(A), from the perspective of random graph models. The statistical model is given by A ∼ P , which is short-hand for A(i, j) ∼ Bernoulli(P (i, j)) for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Then λ(A) converges to λ(P ) in probability under some mild conditions (Chung and Radcliffe, 2011; Benaych-Georges et al., 2019; Bordenave et al., 2020) . To make a formal statement regarding this convergence, we reproduce below a slightly paraphrased version (for notational consistency) of an existing result in this context. Lemma 1 (Theorem 1 of Chung and Radcliffe (2011)). Let\n",
            " be the maximum expected degree, and suppose that for some > 0, ∆ > 4 9 log(2n/ )\n",
            " for sufficiently large n. Then with probability at least 1 − , for sufficiently large n,\n",
            " To make note of a somewhat subtle point: from an inferential perspective it is tempting to view the above result as a consistency result, where λ(P ) is the population quantity or parameter of interest and λ(A) is its estimator. However, in the context of epidemic thresholds, we are interested in the random variable λ(A) itself, as we want to study the contagion spread conditional on a given social contact network. Therefore, in the present context, the above result should not be interpreted as a consistency result.\n",
            " Rather, we can use the convergence result in a different way. For massive networks, the random variable λ(A), which we wish to compute but find it infeasible to do so, is close to the parameter λ(P ). Suppose we can find a random variable T (A) which also converges in probability to λ(P ), and is computationally efficient. Since T (A) and λ(A) both converge in probability to λ(P ), we can use T (A) as an accurate proxy for λ(A). This would address the first of the two issues described at the beginning of this subsection. Furthermore, if T (A) can be computed from a small subset of the data, that would also solve the second issue. This is our central heuristic, which we are going to formalize next.\n",
            " So far, we have not made any structural assumptions on P , we have simply considered the generic inhomogeneous random graph model. Under such a general model, it is very difficult to formulate a statistic T (A) which is cheap to compute and converges to λ(P ). Therefore, we now introduce a structural assumption on P , in the form of the well-known Chung-Lu model that was introduced by Aiello et al. (2000) and subsequently studied in many papers (Chung and Lu, 2002; Chung et al., 2003; Decreusefond et al., 2012; Pinar et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2017) . For a network with n nodes, let δ = (δ 1 , . . . , δ n ) be the vector of expected degrees. Then under the Chung-Lu model,\n",
            " This formulation preserves E[d i ] = δ i , where d i is the degree of the i th node, and is very flexible with respect to degree heterogeneity.\n",
            " Under model (2), note that rank(P ) = 1, and we have\n",
            " Recall that we are looking for some computationally efficient T (A) which converges in probability to λ(P ). We now know that under the Chung-Lu model, λ(P ) is equal to the ratio of the second moment to the first moment of the degree distribution. Therefore, a simple estimator of λ(P ) is given by the sample analogue of this ratio, i.e.,\n",
            " (\n",
            " We now want to demonstrate that approximating λ(A) by T 1 (A) provides us with very substantial computational savings with little loss of accuracy. The approximation error can be quantified as\n",
            " and our goal is to show that e 1 (A) → 0 in probability, while the computational cost of T 1 (A) is much smaller than that of λ(A). We will show this both from a theoretical perspective and an empirical perspective. We next describe the empirical results from a simulation study, and we postpone the theoretical discussion to Section 3 for organizational clarity.\n",
            " We used n = 5000, 10000, and constructed a Chung-Lu random graph model where P (i, j) = θ i θ j . The model parameters θ 1 , . . . , θ n were uniformly sampled from (0, 0.25). Then, we randomly generated 100 networks from the model, and computed λ(A) and T 1 (A). The results are reported in Table 2 . Average runtime for the moment based estimator, T 1 (A), is only 0.07 seconds for n = 5000 and 0.35 seconds for n = 10000, whereas for the spectral radius, λ(A), it is 78.2 seconds and 606.44 seconds respectively, which makes the latter 1100-1700 times more computationally burdensome. The average error for T 1 (A) is very small, and so is the SD of errors. Thus, even for moderately sized networks where n = 5000 or n = 10000, using T 1 (A) as a proxy for λ(A) can reduce the computational cost to a great extent, and the corresponding loss in accuracy is very small. For massive networks where n is in millions, this advantage of T 1 (A) over λ(A) is even greater; however, the computational burden for λ(A) becomes so large that this case is difficult to illustrate using standard computing equipment.\n",
            " Thus, T 1 (A) provides us with a computationally efficient and statistically accurate method for finding the epidemic threshold. \n",
            " The first approximation, T 1 (A), provides us with a computationally efficient method for finding the epidemic threshold. This addresses the first issue pointed out at the beginning of Section 2.1. However, computing T 1 (A) requires data on the degree of all n nodes of the network. Therefore, this does not solve the second issue pointed out at the beginning of Section 2.1. We now propose a second alternative, T 2 , to address the second issue. The idea behind this approximation is based on the same heuristic that was laid out in Section 2.2. Since λ(P ) is a function of degree moments, we can estimate these moments using observed node degrees. In defining T 1 (A), we used observed degrees of all n nodes in the network. However, we can also estimate the degree moments by considering a small sample of nodes, based on random walk sampling. The algorithm for computing T 2 is given in Algorithm 1.\n",

Let L = I − D −1/2 AD −1/2 denote the normalized Laplacian. Let A be a random graph generated from the given expected degrees model, with expected degrees {δ i }, if the minimum expected degree δ min satisfies δ min ln(n), then with probability at least 1 − 1/n = 1 − o(1), we have that for all eigenvalues λ k (L) > λ min (L) of the Laplacian of G,\n",
            " It follows above that ε(Q) = 1−λ 2 (Q) = 1−λ 2 (D −1/2 AD −1/2 ) = λ n−1 (I−D −1/2 AD −1/2 ) = 1 − o(1).

In addition, Corollary 6.1 shows that the number of nodes that we need to query in order to have an accurate approximation is much smaller than n. Furthermore, computing T 2 only requires node sampling and counting degrees, and therefore the runtime is much smaller than eigenvalue algorithms. Therefore, T 2 (A) is a computationally efficient and statistically accurate approximation of the epidemic threshold, while also requiring a much smaller data budget compared to T 1 (A).\n",

            " The second dataset is generated from the preferential attachment model , where each incoming node adds 5 edges to the existing nodes, the probability of choosing a specific node as neighbor being proportional to the current degree of that node. While the preferential attachment model naturally gives rise to a directed graph, we convert the graph to an undirected one before running our algorithm. It is interesting to note that even in this case the Chung-Lu model does not hold, our first approximation, T 1 (A), is close to λ(A).\n",
            " In each of the networks, the random walk algorithm presented in Algorithm 1 was used for sampling. The random walk was started from an arbitrary node and every 10 th node was sampled (to account for the mixing time) from the walk. These samples were then used to calculate T 2 (A). This experiment was repeated 10 times. These gave estimates T 1 2 , . . . , T 10 2 . We then calculate two relative errors ∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 10},\n",
            " We plot the averages of { T 1−T 2 i } and { λ−T 2 i } against the actual number of nodes seen by the random walk. Note that the x-axis accurately reflect how many times the algorithm actually queried the network, not just the number of samples used. Measuring the cost of uniform node sampling in this setting, for instance, would need to keep track of how many nodes are touched by a Metropolis-Hastings walk that implements the uniform distribution. Figure 1 demonstrates the results. For the two synthetic networks, the algorithm is able to get a 10% approximation to the statistic T 1 (A) by exploring at most 10% of the network. With more samples from the random walk, the mean relative errors settle to around 4-5%. However, once we measure the mean relative errors with respect to λ(A), it becomes clearer that the estimator T 2 (A) does better when the graph is closer to the assumed (i.e. Chung-Lu) model. For the Chung-Lu graph, the mean error λ−T 2 essentially is very similar to T 1−T 2 , which is to be expected. For the preferential attachment graph too, it is clear that the estimate T 2 is able to achieve a better than 10% relative error approximation of λ(A).\n",
            " Note that, if we were instead counting only the nodes whose degrees were actually used for estimation, the fraction of network used would be roughly 1 − 2% in all the cases, the majority of the node cost actually goes in making the random walk mix. \n",
            " In this work, we investigated the problem of computing SIR epidemic thresholds of social contact networks from the perspective of statistical inference. We considered the two challenges that arise in this context, due to high computational and data-collection complexity of the spectral radius. For the Chung-Lu network generative model, the spectral radius can be characterized in terms of the degree moments. We utilized this fact to develop two approximations of the spectral radius. The first approximation is computationally efficient and statistically accurate, but requires data on observed degrees of all nodes. The second approximation retains the computationally efficiency and statistically accuracy of the first approximation, while also reducing the number of queries or the sample size quite substantially. The results seem very promising for networks arising from the Chung-Lu and preferential attachment generative models.\n",
            " There are several interesting and important future directions. The methods proposed in this paper have provable guarantees only under the Chung-Lu model, although it works very well under the preferential attachment model. This seems to indicate that the degree based approximation might be applicable to a wider class of models. On the other hand, this leaves open the question of developing a better \"model-free\" estimator, as well as asking similar questions about other network features.\n",
            " In this work we only considered the problem of accurate approximation of the epidemic threshold. From a statistical as well as a real-world perspective, there are several related inference questions. These include uncertainty quantification, confidence intervals, onesample and two-sample testing, etc.\n",

In this paper we only considered static social contact networks, and in future we hope to study epidemic thresholds for time-varying or dynamic networks.\n",
            " We do realize that in the face of the current pandemic, while it is important to pursue research relevant to it, it is also important to be responsible in following the proper scientific process. We would like to state that in this work, the question of epidemic threshold estimation has been formalized from a theoretical viewpoint in a much used, but simple, random graph model. We are not yet at a position to give any guarantees about the performance of our estimator in real social networks. We do hope, however, that the techniques developed here can be further refined to work to give reliable estimators in practical settings.\n",

            "Title: Disease Transmission and Networks q\n",
            "Body Text: Animals living in large groups are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. The close proximity of individuals offers excellent transmission opportunities to a pathogen that is spread by direct contact between hosts. Many studies show a positive relationship between group size and parasitism in terms of prevalence (proportion of infected individuals in a group) and intensity (number of pathogens per individual) (Strassmann, 1981; Côté and Poulinb, 1995; Rifkin et al., 2012) . If the host population is homogeneous in exposure and susceptibility to a pathogen, the birth and death rates of the host and the contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals are sufficient to predict the infection dynamics. However, groups are rarely homogeneous and individuals differ among themselves in various respects such as age, sex, physiological state, behavior, and spatial location. This causes individuals to differ in their probability of becoming infected and transmitting the infection, making it more difficult to predict the trajectory of an infection.\n",
            " The rate at which an infection spreads and whether it persists in the population depend on the magnitude of the key epidemiological parameter, R 0 , or the mean number of infections caused by a single infected individual. In order to stop an epidemic outbreak, R 0 must be maintained below 1. According to the mass-action SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model, the most basic model of epidemic spread, R 0 ¼bTS, where b is the transmission coefficient that incorporates both infectiousness and contact rate of the infected individuals, T is the duration of infectiousness, and S is the available number of susceptible individuals (Bjørnstad et al., 2002; Volz and Meyers, 2007) . The simple SIR model has provided many important insights into the epidemiology of a wide range of pathogens but its fundamental assumption of homogeneous mixing among individuals is clearly unrealistic. Population-level estimates of R 0 can obscure the considerable variation in contact rate and infectiousness among individuals. Several studies have shown that typically, 80% of the transmission events are contributed by 20% of the host population: a trend that is referred to as the 80/20 rule (Perkins et al., 2003; Paull et al., 2012) . This was highlighted during the recent global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) when a few infected individuals were responsible for giving rise to an unusually large number of secondary cases (Galvani and May, 2005) . Whether or not infected individuals have contact rates that are disproportionately higher than the population average has important implications because public-health programs generally rely on the immunization of only a fraction of the hosts to protect the entire population.\n",
            " The effects of host heterogeneity on the spread of infectious disease can be most simply modeled by dividing a population into subpopulations with different within-group and between-group transmission rates. A more explicit approach is to use models that incorporate the structure of the actual contact network in the population (Scott, 2017) . Unlike the continually changing set of contacts in random mixing models, each individual is assigned a finite set of contacts to who they can transmit infection and from who they can be infected. Predictions from network models can be considerably different from those that use mean-based approaches. Although individuals may have the same number of contacts per unit time in both network and mass action models, the fixed contact structure in networks can lead to rapid, localized spread of an infection followed by a slowing down of the process as the number of susceptible individuals depletes locally. This makes disease extinctions more likely than outbreaks though the latter are more explosive if they occur.\n",
            " The use of network models also has bearing on the evolution of the pathogens themselves. Given their high reproductive rates, pathogens are likely to undergo rapid selection to adapt to the available transmission routes between infected and susceptible individuals (Bishop et al., 2000) . Both theoretical and experimental results show that high transmission rates are selected in localized networks where there is intense competition for susceptible hosts while networks that are more global in their connectivity select for lower transmission rates due to lack of such competition. Localized contact structure also selects for a higher diversity in the pathogen population in contrast to a randomly mixed host population where cross-immunity to similar strains structures the pathogen population into discrete, nonoverlapping strains.\n",
            " A transmission network is generally defined by a matrix X that describes the connections among all the individuals within a group. In its simplest form, the matrix is unweighted, with x ij ¼1, if there is one or more interactions that can transmit an infection and x ij ¼0 if there is none. The matrix is also generally undirected, meaning that infection can pass either way across an interaction or x ij ¼x ji . More detailed models can be constructed using weighted, directed networks (Opsahl et al., 2010) . The structure of the transmission network can be characterized by a number of parameters that can be quantified from these matrices. The most commonly used ones are (1) degree, the number of connections an individual has; (2) density, the proportion of existing connections out of all possible ones; (3) path length, the average number of links that connect any two individuals; and (4) clustering, the density of the local neighborhood or cliquishness (Boccaletti et al., 2006) . Focal measures such as degree can identify high-risk individuals in the population and can be used to inform surveillance and infection control strategies. Network level measures such as average path length and clustering coefficient can make predictions about the spread of the infection in the population. Critical points that reflect order of magnitude shifts in network properties and the consequent propagation of an epidemic can be identified from phase transitions in network parameters.\n",
            " Network models are difficult and time consuming to build because they require information about the connectivity between every pair of individuals in a group. In this effort, researchers have mainly relied on infection tracing that describes the actual connections through which the infection spreads or contact tracing that looks at all the potential connections from a source individual (Keeling and Eames, 2005) . Network models are also complex in terms of their statistical evaluation unlike differential equations based mass-mixing models. Moreover, as different diseases are transmitted via different transmission pathways, network models are disease specific and cannot be easily generalized. In the face of these difficulties, simulating networks with different structures ( Fig. 1) and studying the parameters that influence transmission dynamics has been an important and influential research paradigm.\n",
            " In these types of networks, each individual has a fixed number of random connections, resulting in a network with no clustering and short path lengths (Barabási and Albert, 1999) . The early growth rate of an infectious process and the final epidemic size are lower in these networks compared with the mass-action model, largely because of the quick depletion of the local environment of susceptible individuals around an infected individual.\n",
            " In these networks, individuals are connected only to their adjacent neighbors, leading to a homogeneous network with high clustering and long path lengths (Olfati-Saber and Shamma, 2005) . This leads to an even stronger depletion of the local environment and thus the growth rate of the infection. \n",
            " The transmission properties of small-world networks have generated a lot of interest and are important to understand because many biological networks including human social networks show small-world properties Lago-Fernández et al., 2000) . They lie somewhere between regular and random networks, displaying high clustering but small path lengths due to the existence of a few long-range connections. Even though the transmission process is still largely localized, the few longrange links allow the infection to spread relatively quickly and more synchronously over the entire network. Small-world networks may or may not have a scale-free structure.\n",
            " These networks are characterized by an extreme heterogeneity in connectivity, the number of contacts per individual being described by a power law distribution (Barabási and Bonabeau, 2003) . A few highly connected individuals, called superspreaders in the epidemic context, have a disproportionately high influence on the transmission process (Zhou et al., 2006) . Networks of human sexual contacts have been shown to follow such a distribution and the transmission and maintenance of sexually transmitted diseases thus depends mainly on a few promiscuous individuals (Liljeros et al., 2001) . In such networks, control measures directed at random individuals are quite ineffective while targeted interventions work really well. By immunizing the superspreaders, the contact network becomes sparser by orders of magnitude and brings about a drastic reduction in the number of transmission events.\n",
            " Complex network models being hard to parameterize can lead to predictions that are no more reliable or maybe even worse than those from simpler frameworks. However, with the relative dearth of suitable experimental systems with sufficient social complexity, opportunistically obtained data about the course of natural epidemics in humans have been the only major recourse for testing network models. In this context, the honeybee colony can prove to be an ideal model system. Honeybees not only provide the setting of a crowded social group that is susceptible to a vast array of infectious diseases but they are also extremely amenable to a variety of experimental paradigms at both the individual and the social level. The long association of honeybees and their pathogens over evolutionary time provides a backdrop to test how the network of social interactions in the colony could serve as the central arena for host-pathogen dynamics (Nazzi et al., 2012) . The pathogens can exploit the network to rapidly spread across the colony, while the host can use its structural properties as a mechanism to resist the spread. The recent finding that honeybees possess only one-third as many genes for immunity as other insects strongly suggests that the structure of social organization is an important mechanism that compensates for a lower physiological immunocompetence (Evans et al., 2006) .\n",
            " Interaction networks in a social insect colony could be organized according to one of the following designs: (1) work-chains with each individual performing all the required parts of a given task, (2) work-chains with each individual performing one and only one part of a task with one or more other individuals completing the rest, and (3) work-chains with each individual performing only one part of a task at any given time but performing all the parts equally frequently. The efficiency and the reliability of material and information flow are substantially incremented in each successive type of network, which is adaptive for ergonomic purposes. It is however less recognized that the same design features will also promote the transmission efficiency of pathogens, increasing the vulnerability of the colony to an infectious disease.\n",
            " Food, information, as well as pathogens primarily enter a honeybee colony from the environment through the foragers. Nearestneighbor based interactions drive the subsequent transfer process, spreading these across the colony. With the individuals spatially distributed within the colony according to their ages, this results in a centripetal flow from the oldest individuals at the outer edge of the colony to the youngest ones residing at the center (Tilman, 1982) . This flow pattern imparts some amount of protection to the most valuable youngest members from invading pathogens: a phenomenon that can be termed 'organizational immunity'. (Ping and Yihua, 2008) . This social contact network in the colony is therefore highly structured and nonrandom, leading to a pool of individuals that is heterogeneous with respect to its probability of contacting, manifesting, and transmitting an infection, presenting an invading pathogen with the challenge of negotiating this complex landscape (Fig. 2) .\n",
            " Superimposed on this general age-based interaction pattern, one also sees that only a minority of the individuals in the colony are the primary drivers of the majority of the transfer process. This gives the interaction network an appearance of a scale-free structure. In contrast to such heterogeneous connectivity observed in the large honeybee colonies, individuals are more uniformly connected to each other in social insect species with smaller colony sizes. Within-species comparisons suggest that colony size is a primary driver of network structure and complete mixing becomes more and more improbable with increasing number of individuals. There is considerable variation in network structure even among colonies of similar sizes and it has been shown that the density of contact network in the colony determines the spread of a contagious pathogen within it.\n",
            " Small perturbations in the structure of social organization can bring about large changes in transmission dynamics. Many honeybee diseases, which remain in the background at a low level in the colony, can rapidly turn lethal and erupt into an epidemic under certain conditions generally referred to as 'stress'. Investigation of these so-called 'stress' conditions suggest that they translate into disruption of the normal social organization in the colony in the face of contingencies such as a nectar flow in the environment, high demand for a certain task, or a rapid increase in colony population size (Martin, 2001; Guzmán-Novoa et al., 2010) . The resulting higher activity level and more generalization of labor profiles can lead to higher contact rates or other changes in social network structure.\n",
            " A disease can also bring about some restructuring of the social organization in the colony. Disease at an individual level is defined as a disruption of homeostatic mechanisms, leading to an alteration in the normal set point of an organism and its symptoms are the physiological mechanisms that restore it. This definition can be extended to an epidemic being a process that disrupts the social organization critical to the functioning of a group and its symptoms are mechanisms that, via collective action of its members, attempt to restore the social structure. It has been speculated that a disease symptom such as bees starting to forage at a younger age is an adaptive response on the part of the host that serves to reduce within-colony transmission of the disease by keeping infected bees outside . However, it is equally plausible that such a response can in fact increase transmission rates by contaminating the food they collect. Behavioral fever in response to an infection, which can inhibit the development of a pathogen, requires bees to cluster more tightly that can in turn increase the contact rate among them (Mayack and Naug, 2010) . Bees infected with a pathogen have also been shown to incur an energetic stress that increases their hunger level, leading them to be more eager solicitors but more reluctant donors of food. This could lead uninfected and infected bees to occupy different positions in the contact network in terms of sources and sinks in the transmission chain. It is important to note here that the structure of the social network in the colony is an emergent property that arises from individual behavior, which can be altered by simple pathophysiological mechanisms arising from a disease.\n",
            " For disease ecologists interested in using network theory, the development of network statistics remains a major research focus. A second area of rapidly developing interest is dynamic networks which account for the possibility that the structure of the contact networks might not remain constant over time, maybe partly as a consequence of the disease outbreak itself. More importantly, empirical research has lagged behind the pace of theoretical work made possible by increased computational power. Matching efforts to develop laboratory experimental systems are urgently needed to explore the interaction between network structure and disease dynamics. Integration of behavioral biology and physiology to the already existing framework of ecology, evolution, and mathematical modeling would also be critical to our understanding of the structural and functional properties of biological networks.\n",
            " Research on the proximate basis underlying the behavioral interactions among individuals will give insights into the role of demographic and environmental factors on disease dynamics via their effects on social structure. It will also help answer the important questions of how the pathophysiology of a disease can alter the structure of the contact network and whether such symptomatic restructuring benefits the host or the pathogen. In social insect groups where the colony social network is considered to be primarily a product of ergonomic considerations, it is important to explore whether pathogens have played any selective role in its design. This addresses the broad issue of how any group of interconnected units, whether a bee colony or a computer cluster, deals with the challenge of shielding its network from attacks without seriously compromising its performance.\n",
            " It is being increasingly recognized that excessive use of antimicrobials to treat diseases selects for resistant strains of pathogens that can no longer be eliminated by the same drugs. Intervention measures that have short-term epidemiological benefits but long-term evolutionary repercussions have led to the recent resurgence of many diseases and the heightened virulence of pathogen populations. This has led to the suggestion that understanding the natural dynamics of a disease from an evolutionary, ecological, and behavioral perspective might provide pointers to preventive and curative methods that are more sustainable. There are plenty of accounts concerning behavior and customs in humans that affect the transmission of infectious diseases. Agricultural practices such as the clearing of land and irrigation have brought increased contact between human populations and animal reservoirs of diseases such as schistosomiasis and malaria (Steinmann et al., 2006) . Urbanization has brought about increased transmission of lyme disease, cholera, dengue, and leishmaniasis (Kendall et al., 1991; Desjeux, 2001; Bradley and Altizer, 2007; Chowdhury et al., 2011) . Changes in sexual behavior have had a large influence on the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases (Bunnell et al., 2006; Satterwhite et al., 2007) . With the current threat of these numerous emerging diseases, it has become extremely important to understand the dynamics of infectious processes in the context of crowded living conditions that characterize many animal groups and humans. An understanding of the behavioral processes that define the structure of a social group will help identify the transmission pathways used by pathogens to spread and suggest possible ways to manage the social structure as a counteractive measure to both prevent and control the spread of a likely epidemic. \n",

            "Body Text: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. Respiratory viruses, whose pathogen role have been underestimated for many years, account for more than 22% of adult CAP cases [1, 2] . Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses, ubiquitous in the environment, and are also a common cause of respiratory infections. HAdV pneumonia typically is limited to newborns, immunocompromised hosts, and school or military camp populations [3] . Severe HAdV pneumonia has been frequently described in immunocompromised patients. Respiratory infection caused by HAdV in immunocompetent patients is usually thought to be mild and self-limited. However, with advances in modern molecular techniques, HAdV has been increasingly found to be involved in sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe CAP in healthy adults [4, 5] .\n",
            " To date, at least 69 HAdV genotypes have been recognized, and they are assigned to seven subgroups (A-G) according to genetic, biophysical and biochemical characteristics [6] . Species B (HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14) is the predominant HAdV specie associated with respiratory infections among adults. HAdV-55, a genotype recombination between HAdV-11 and HAdV-14, has been the reported cause of sporadic or outbreak events of CAP in Turkey [7] , Singapore [8] , Korea [9] and China from 2004. HAdV-55-related sequential outbreaks in several provinces and regions of China gained increased attention since 2006 [10] [11] [12] . As just one pathogen of CAP, HAdV accounts for 5% of adult CAP cases in northern China between 2010 and 2012, while HAdV-55 accounts for more than 40% of identified HAdV positive samples [2] . Comparative studies showed that the serotypes of HAdV may be one of the factors which determine the severity of adenoviral pneumonia. HAdV-55 was thought to be more closely associated with severe pneumonia as compared to other serotypes (HAdV-3, -7 and -14) [2] . Clinical understanding of severe CAP induced by HAdV-55 is still limited, though the pathogen has been fully characterized by whole-genome sequencing. Current knowledge of HAdV-55-induced severe pneumonia is mainly derived from single case reports or relatively small, single-center series.\n",
            " Beginning in February 2012, virus screening was carried out for an etiological study of adult severe CAP at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) in Beijing and the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University (SHHMU) in Hebei province, China. These two institutions, which have high referral rate in Northern China, encounter multiple cases of HAdV pneumonia annually. The present multicenter case series report describes in detail the clinical features and outcomes of severe HAdV CAP in immunocompetent adults.\n",
            " The institutional ethics review boards of PUMCH and SHHMU approved this retrospective study. All data on the study patients was analyzed anonymously. The requirement for informed consent by individual patients was waived given the retrospective nature of the study. We performed a multicentre retrospective review of all consecutive patients diagnosed with severe HAdV CAP in the Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the two hospitals between February 1, 2012 and April 30, 2014. The criteria for severe CAP was defined by modified American Thoracic Society criteria [13] or risk class V of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) [14] . HAdV infection was confirmed by positive multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HAdV from lower respiratory tract samples, such as sputum, tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Additionally, we required negative other microbiological testing including bacterial, fungal or other common respiratory viruses at admission. Patients with HIV infection or neutropenia, those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy, pregnant or breast-feeding women, and those with malignant neoplasms were excluded.\n",
            " CAP patients whose clinical conditions deteriorated rapidly despite appropriate use of broadspectrum antibiotics for 2-3 days were suspected of having atypical pneumonia. Lower respiratory tract samples, urine, blood, and acute and convalescent serum samples were collected for thorough microbiological tests including: (1) sputum specimens for staining and microbiological cultures; (2) urine specimens for Legionella pneumophila and S. pneumonia antigen detection; (3) blood cultures; (4) lower respiratory tract samples for virus real-time PCR detection (tested viruses included: HAdV, rhinovirus, cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus); (5) acute and convalescent serum samples for Chlamydia Pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila antibody titer determination.\n",

            " Investigators created a standardized data form for clinical information collection that included demographics (age, sex and smoking status), PSI score (to assess the severity of illness at admission), comorbidities, clinical symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest pain, diarrhea, myalgias and sore throat), vital signs, laboratory tests, arterial blood gas analysis results, microbiological findings (including HAdV types) and chest radiologic characteristics. Concomitant medications, respiratory support, complications (e.g. use of mechanical ventilation or septic shock) and overall outcomes were also recorded.\n",
            " Continuous variables are expressed as median (interquartile range) and categorical variables as number and percent. Differences between groups were assessed with the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Significance was fixed at P<0.05.\n",
            " A total 15 cases (seven from SHHMU and eight from PUMCH) were confirmed with HAdV as the only pathogen of pneumonia. Two patients with HAdV positive samples were excluded due to possible coinfection with Legionella pneumophila and S. pneumonia respectively. All 15 patients were admitted to the ICU and fulfilled the criteria of severe CAP and of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n",
            " Patients with severe HAdV CAP usually were young and middle-aged adults and the median age was 30 years (range, 18 to 52 years). Male gender (73.3%) was more common than female gender, and all patients who did not survive were male. All 15 patients were non-immunocompromised. Three patients (who were aged >50) had underlying diseases of hypertension. Seven patients were smokers. Most patients (14 of 15 patients) came from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region of Northern China. The illnesses of all patients occurred in the winter and spring seasons, and most HAdVs (60%) were identified in April. Definitive HAdV typing of the 15 cases were all classed as species B (11 were type 55, two were type 7, one was type 3, and one was type 14) (see Fig 1) .\n",
            " As shown in Table 1 , flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough and little sputum, were most commonly observed at the onset of illness. All patients presented with a high fever, with a median body temperature of 39.8°C (range, 39.0°C to 40.8°C), which persisted for 7 days (range, 1 to 10 days). Most clinical symptoms and signs between survivors and non-survivors did not differ, except for PSI score and respiratory rate; these were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (P = 0.013 and 0.022, respectively). The median time from onset to ICU admission was seven days, and most patients (86.7%) showed apparent dyspnea at admission. Arterial blood gas analysis at ICU admission revealed profound hypoxia, with a median PaO 2 /FiO 2 of 120 mmHg. PaO 2 /FiO 2 in non-survivors was significantly lower than that in survivors (p = 0.019). There was no difference in laboratory findings between survivors and non-survivors, except that hypersensitive CRP in non-survivors were significantly lower than in survivors (P = 0.026) ( Table 2) . White blood cell counts in most patients were in the normal range.\n",
            " Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CK), creatinine and urea nitrogen levels were higher in non-survivors, but the differences were not significant.\n",
            " Consolidation (86.7%), ground-grass opacities (GGOs) (66.7%), and pleural effusions (73.3%) were the most common findings in severe HAdV CAP (Table 2) . Diffuse GGOs were revealed as predominant in two patients (13.3%) (Fig 2A) . Within one week after illness onset, focal consolidation was the predominant finding in ten patients (Figs 2B and 3A), while three patients showed bilateral multiple consolidations accompanied by GGOs in two patients ( Fig  2C) . The most commonly involved lobe was the right lower lobe (n = 5), followed by the left lower lobe (n = 3), left upper lobe (n = 1), and right upper lobe (n = 1). Follow-up radiologic findings in 13 patients with consolidation showed the rapid development of bilateral consolidations within 10 days after illness onset, usually accompanied by adjacent GGOs and pleural effusions (Fig 2D and S1 Fig). The number of lobes with consolidation was significantly increased in non-survivors than in survivors (p = 0.011). The parenchymal abnormalities began to absorb about two weeks after illness onset, with no appearances of fibrosis.\n",
            " Overall treatment outcomes of study patients are summarized in Table 2 . Empirical broadspectrum intravenous antibiotics were given to all the patients, while eight were prescribed antiviral drugs. Antiviral treatment was started prior to the confirmation of viral pneumonia in our study. Acylovir, gancyclovir, oseltamivir and ribavirin are all widely used empirically in China. In our study, oseltamivir was used in all eight patients who received antiviral drugs, while ribavirin and gancyclovir were used in combination with oseltamivir in four and three patients, respectively. Ten out of 15 (66.7%) patients received adjuvant intravenous immunoglobulin for 3-5 days, while fourteen (93.3%) received corticosteroids for 3-10 days, including hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone. Hospital acquired pulmonary infections developed in seven cases, and Acinetobacter baumannii was the dominating pathogen. Four patients did not survive (26.7%). One case died of respiratory failure caused by ARDS and three other patients died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome which mainly included respiratory failure and septic shock. The need for mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors were similar between non-survivors and survivors. Length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation in non-survivors were less than that in survivors, but the differences were not significant.\n",
            " In the past decade, adult CAP induced by HAdV has been causing increased concern worldwide, especially in China. HAdV accounted for 0.8% of adult acute respiratory tract infections in Beijing between 2005 and 2010, while HAdV-3 was the most frequently detected serotype [15] . However, the proportion of HAdV CAP increased to 4.2%-5% in the following two years [2, 16] , and HAdV-55 became the predominant culprit. HAdV-55 is thought to be closely associated with severe CAP, and the results of our study verified this phenomenon again. To the best of our knowledge, the number of patients needed mechanical ventilation (14 patients) in this report is significantly more than those of two to six cases in all recent investigations of HAdV-55 related severe CAP. Our study may provide some new understanding for clinical characteristics of HAdV-55 related severe CAP in immunocompetent adults. Demographics in our report were consistent with the previous investigations [17, 18] . Young and middle-aged male adults were susceptible hosts for severe HAdV CAP. All patients of severe HAdV CAP occurred in the winter and spring seasons just after the influenza epidemic, which indicates that the relationship between HAdV CAP and influenza may be an appropriate focus for future research. All severe CAP caused by HAdV-55 in immunocompetent adults in China in previous investigations occurred in Northern China, mainly in Baoding, Hebei province and Beijing. The wider dispersion of our cases suggests that HAdV-55 is still active in Northern China, and might be expanding its scope of influence. The clinical features and disease progression of our cases are highly similar to those of ARDS caused by HAdV-55 or other types of HAdV described in previous reports [19] . All patients presented with high fevers and cough. Common manifestations of HAdV infection such as diarrhea or conjunctivitis were not common in our patients. PSI scores, one of the most commonly used severity assessment tools for CAP, can also provide important prognostic information for HAdV-55 induced CAP [2] . In this report, absence of underlying diseases and abnormal laboratory findings such as decreased hematocrit, hyponatremia and hyperglycemia, highlight the contribution of abnormal respiratory rate and PaO 2 /FiO 2 to the high values we saw in patients' PSI scores. Respiratory rate is an independent risk marker for in-hospital mortality of CAP [20] . Low CRP values are commonly considered to be associated with a less severe systemic inflammatory response, which should reflect a better prognosis. Interestingly, our data showed that among patients with ARDS caused by HAdV, a low initial serum CRP level at admission correlated to a fatal outcome. Interpretation of this result may be difficult, though a similar phenomenon was found in severe CAP caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae [21] and CAP patients with liver cirrhosis [22] . CRP is an acute phase protein, which is synthesized by the liver in response to tissue damage. It may be reasonable to speculate that severe HAdV CAP accompanied by slightly elevated CRP may indicate impairment of the protective inflammatory response.\n",
            " In accordance with the reputation of respiratory viruses for causing diffuse interstitial infiltrates, Clark reported bilateral GGOs as the most common abnormality in 22 immunocompetent adults of adenovirus pneumonia [4] . However, more and more research supports consolidation rather than interstitial infiltrates as the main imaging characteristic of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. To date, adenovirus is the only virus known to cause focal or lobar consolidation (the typical manifestation of bacterial pneumonia) as its main imaging abnormality. The initial image findings of adenovirus pneumonia, which resemble bacterial pneumonia may mislead diagnosis and treatment. As Gu concluded, single lobar or segmental consolidation was more common in patients without ARDS, while patients with ARDS had bilateral and multilobar lung consolidations [17] . Compared to survivors in this report, non-survivors had more extensive consolidations which correlated with respiratory rate and PaO 2 /FiO 2 .\n",
            " At present there is no specific treatment for severe HAdV pneumonia and high mortality rates are often reported in cases of severe HAdV pneumonia. Among patients needing mechanical ventilation in previous reports about severe HAdV-55 pneumonia, nine out of 22 (40.9%) cases died [2, 9, [17] [18] [19] . Early administration of cidofovir showed possible effect in six immunocompetent patients [9] , but randomized controlled trials are lacking and cidofovir is not available in most hospitals in China. Mortality (26.7%) in our study is relatively low and corticosteroids were frequently used in this study. Adjuvant corticosteroids for CAP and ARDS remains controversial. Improved mortality and a good safety record for corticosteroids given to patients with severe CAP were seen by some meta-analyses [23] [24] [25] . However, corticosteroids have also been found to be an independent predictor of mortality or other poor outcomes in multiple studies of other viral pneumonias [26] [27] [28] . The effect of corticosteroids on severe HAdV CAP is still uncertain, although there have been a few case reports. One case of a fatal HAdV-3 pneumonia with hypercytokinemia, \"pulse\" methylprednisolone treatment resulted in the rapid amelioration of the patient's respiratory distress [29] . In a study focused on severe CAP caused by HAdV-55, 10 out of 18 patients received corticosteroids and total mortality was 5.9% [17] . However, given the small sample size and design of our non-controlled study, we can not conclude that corticosteroids are helpful in severe HAdV CAP.\n",
            " Our study has several limitations. First, for the determined HAdV types (especially type 55), whole-genome sequencings were not performed due to its retrospective nature. Second, there were a relatively small number of cases because of the relatively low incidence of severe adenovirus pneumonia. The results of comparison between survivors and non-survivors may also lead to bias due to the unequal number of patients in each group. Finally, treatment effects of cidofovir and other antiviral drugs could not be compared because cidofovir was not available in the two hospitals in this study.\n",
            " In conclusion, HAdV-55 plays a very important role in cases of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults of Northern China, and surveillance of this agent as a cause of severe CAP is warranted. HAdV should be tested in severe CAP patients with initial negative bacterial cultures and a failure to respond to antibiotics, even though image findings and clinical presentation might suggest bacterial pneumonia.\n",

            "Body Text: Bats have been increasingly associated with emerging and re-emerging viruses. The likelihood of possible transmission of these pathogens to humans is ever increasing as a result of human encroachment on animal habitats, climate change and change of human behaviour. Pathogens of particular public health importance are filoviruses [1, 2] , coronaviruses [3, 4] , paramyxoviruses [5, 6] and lyssaviruses [7, 8] . Other viruses, without a known human disease link, have also been detected recently [9] [10] [11] . Some human pathogens, such as Rift Valley fever virus, that have been detected in bats were likely a result of coincidental infection and do not constitute proof that bats play a role as reservoirs [12] .\n",
            " Bats are parasitized by a number of ectoparasites, including mites, bat flies, ticks and fleas, and often by some or all of these simultaneously [13] . The bat flies are members of two families in the Diptera order, namely, the Streblidae and Nycteribiidae, and are highly host-specific obligate ectoparasites of bats [13] [14] [15] . Both bat fly families are hematophagous and potentially capable of (Qiagen).

At the first sign of CPE, culture supernatant was collected, cleared of cellular content by centrifugation (3000ˆg for 5 min), and subsequently fixed in an equal volume of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Hepes buffer (pH 6.9) for visualization of virus particles by negative staining. A Beckman Airfuge ® (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was used to concentrate all samples (10 min at 207 kPa), after which droplets of sample were adsorbed to 0.25% formar-coated copper grids for a minimum of 10 min, rinsed twice in deionised, distilled water and stained briefly in 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.9). For ultramicrotomy, the remaining infected monolayers were flooded with the same fixative overnight, then routinely processed (postfixation in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide, graded ethanol dehydration, infiltration with a low viscosity resin (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) and overnight polymerisation at 70˝C). Seventy nm sections were cut on a Leica EM-UC6, double stained with saturated uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed at 80 kV on a BioTwin Spirit (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA).

RNA was extracted using a column based kit (Direct-Zol RNA kit, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). To increase sensitivity, rRNA was depleted using the same method as described previously [37] . RNAs were converted to cDNA and amplified using SISPA as described previously with modifications [38] . To enhance coverage of the terminal ends, an oligo containing three rGTP at the 3' end (GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCGGCCATTAT GGCCrGrGrG) was added during first-strand cDNA synthesis and the reverse transcriptase was changed to Maxima H Minus (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which has terminal transferase activity that enables addition of the rGTP containing oligo to the 5' end during cDNA synthesis. Amplicons were sheared and libraries prepared using the Illumina TRuSeq DNA Library preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed either on an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina) or NextSeq 500 (Illumina) using either a 2ˆ150 or 2ˆ250 version2 kit. Illumina and SISPA adapter sequences were trimmed from the sequencing reads using Cutadapt-1.2.1 [39] , quality filtering was conducted with Prinseq-lite (-min len 50-derep 14-lc method dust-lc threshold 3-trim ns left 1-trim ns right 1-trim qual right 15) [40] and reads were assembled into contigs using Ray Meta with kmer length = 25 [41] .

            " The MEGA (version 6) program was used to prepare alignments (ClustalW) of nucleic acid segment sequences, deduced amino acid sequences, phylogenetic trees and pairwise distance calculations [42] . The publicly available reovirus sequences used in the analysis were obtained from NCBI-Nucleotide (Genbank). Nucleotide sequences from a small number of viruses from each genus in the Reoviridae family were used to prepare a Maximum Likelihood tree showing the placement of MAHLV in the family based on the full RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoding segment. Maximum Likelihood trees were prepared using amino acid sequences of all open reading frames from all segments, showing the placement of Mahlapitsi virus (MAHLV) in the Orthoreovirus genus relative to other viruses in this genus for which sequence is available on Genbank. Virus sequence accession numbers are summarised in Table 1 . The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model [43] . The tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches (1000 bootstrap iterations).

DNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and the method as described by the manufacturer. Amplification of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was performed with barcoding primers as described by Tortosa et al.: LCO1490 and HCO2198 [13] . Polymerase chain reaction was carried out in 50 µL reactions containing 25 µL MyTaq Red mix 2ˆ(Bioline, London, UK), 2 µL of forward and reverse primer (10 µM), DNA template (10 µL) and nuclease free water (11 µL).

Purified PCR amplicon products were then sequenced at the NICD Core Sequencing Facility (NICD, Sandringham, South Africa).\n",
            " Replication of MAHLV was evaluated in two cell lines: Vero E6 (source African green monkey kidney) and C6-36 (source Aedes albopictus mosquitoes). Cells were grown to 50%-70% confluency in 25 cm 2 flasks, supernatant removed and respective flasks inoculated with 1 mL of 10´1, 10´2, 10´3 and 10´5 dilutions from stock virus (1ˆ10 6 TCID 50 /mL) in EMEM. After 1 h adsorption at 37˝C (VeroE6) or 28˝C (C6-36), the inoculum was removed, cells washed with 5 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fresh EMEM, antibiotics and 2% foetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) added. Cultures were incubated for 13 days at 37˝C (VeroE6) or 28˝C (C6-36) while 0.5 mL aliquots of supernatant were collected from each flask directly after inoculation and addition of fresh medium (day 0), followed by day 4, 7 and 13. RNA was extracted from 140 µL of the serial supernatant collections (QIamp viral RNA kit, Qiagen) and subjected to TaqMan real-time RT-PCR. A Taqman real-time RT-PCR was developed to detect the RdRp gene of MAHLV. Primers and probe sequences are: forward MORV_796F (5'-TAGTGGTTCGTATGCGTGGT-3'), reverse MORV_893R (5'-AACAGCCATTCAATCTCAGG-3') and probe MORV_875P (FAM-GGCACATATCCCTCAACTGG-BHQ), with the number in the oligonucleotide name indicating the nucleic acid position in the segment encoding RdRp. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on the extracted RNA using the Qiagen One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) on a SmartCycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with the following program: reverse transcription (50˝C for 30 min), hot-start Taq activation (95˝C for 15 min) and 50 cycles of amplification (95˝C for 15 s; 52˝C for 25 s plus signal acquisition; 72˝C for 20 s).

            " From a total of 273 bat ectoparasite pools subjected to virus isolation by three blind passages, two yielded an agent that caused obvious cytopathic effects in the form of syncytia (giant cell) formation by three or four days post inoculation (d.p.i.) (Figure 2 ). The parasite pool that yielded MAHLV isolate 2511 was collected from an apparently healthy adult female Rousettus aegyptiacus bat captured at Mahune cave in May 2013. CPE in Vero cells were noted after two blind passages, and the supernatant collected on day five from passage four in a 75 cm 2 flask containing infected Vero cells yielded 1ˆ10 6.25 TCID 50 /mL of the unknown virus. The second parasite pool that yielded MAHLV isolate 06-24 was collected from an apparently healthy juvenile male Rousettus aegyptiacus bat captured at Mahune cave in June 2013. CPE in Vero cells were noted after three blind passages, and the supernatant collected on day five from passage five in a 75 cm 2 flask containing infected Vero cells yielded 1ˆ10 6 TCID 50 /mL of the virus. These supernatants, passage four of 2511 and passage five of 06-24, were used for subsequent identification by TEM and NGS. The ectoparasites from which the viruses were isolated were morphologically identified as bat flies, Eucampsipoda africana Theodor (Diptera: Nycteribiidae) ( Figure 3 ) [44] . Sequencing of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) and alignment to sequences available on Genbank, followed by phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4 ) confirms that the bat flies in this study are closest related to Eucampsipoda spp. identified before. \n",
            " Initial screening of negatively-stained culture supernatants revealed the presence of rounded icosahedrons lacking envelopes, which resembled non-Rotavirus-like virions of the Reoviridae ( Figure 5 ).

TEM observations therefore suggested that the isolated virus belonged to the Reoviridae, sub-family Spinareovirinae. An unbiased next-generation sequencing approach using SISPA amplification confirmed the presence of a novel Orthoreovirus. Initial sequencing results of both isolates yielded enough sequence coverage to identify all 10 segments. A polyetheleneglycol (PEG) precipitated preparation of isolate 06-24 yielded the most viral specific reads and formed 11 contigs aligning to Othoreoviruses using BLASTn and BLASTx. Both the 5' and 3' ends were missing for all the segments, so to obtain complete genomes for each isolate, rRNA depletion and a combination of SISPA and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (SISPA-RACE) was done. Read numbers were also increased by running samples on an Illumina Nextseq 500. Both an increase in the percentage of viral reads aligning to the genome segments and an increase in coverage of the ends were observed. Presence of MAHLV in the original homogenates from which the isolates were obtained was confirmed by SISPA amplification and NGS directly from the homogenates. Expectedly, only a low number of reads from both homogenates mapped to the MAHLV sequence due to the high amount of host sequence obscuring viral specific sequences combined with likely low viral load in the homogenates and the relatively low sensitivity of the SISPA method.\n",

Maximum Likelihood trees were prepared using the deduced amino acid sequences from the open reading frames (ORF's) of all the virus' segments and those of other viruses in the Orthoreovirus genus (Figures 8-10) . A distinct clade is formed by MAHLV, Bush viper reovirus, Baboon orthoreovirus and Broome virus within the genus. The above-mentioned clade is visibly distinct from others composed of bat-associated viruses; the Nelson Bay orthoreovirus and bat-derived mammalian orthoreoviruses. The closest relative of MAHLV, based on sequence homology of a conserved core protein, is Bush viper reovirus (Lambda B nucleic acid identity-63.7%; RdRp amino acid identity-66.3%) while the closest bat-associated virus is Broome virus (LambdaB nucleic acid identity-60.7%; RdRp amino acid identity-58.0%) ( Table 2) . Homology of the divergent major outer capsid protein of MAHLV to known orthoreoviruses is much lower: Sigma B nucleic acid identity-28.7%-41.9%; amino acid identity-5.6%-24.3% (Table 3) .\n",
            " The genome segments of MAHLV were named according to the nucleotide length, which is consistent with the nomenclature of other orthoreoviruses [26] . A summary of the MAHLV genome is given in Table 4 . The total genome size is 23,200 nucleotides and predicted to encode eleven proteins, seven of which are structural. All ten genome segments of MAHLV contain an identical 3' terminal sequence, UCAUC-3', which is conserved between all known species of Orthoreovirus, and an identical 5' terminal sequence, 5'-GGUCA which is unique to MAHLV. Non-coding regions (NCRs) are present at both ends of the genome segments, with the 5' NCRs being shorter in nucleotide length than 3' NCRs. The nucleotide sequences of the two isolates of MAHLV, 2511 and 06-24, are not identical. Nucleotide homology of the RdRp encoding segment between the two isolates is 93.5% (99.8% deduced amino acid sequence), and 80.4% (89.0% deduced amino acid sequence) for the Sigma B encoding segment.\n",
            " Putative protein functions were determined by BLASTx similarity searches to sequences available on Genbank, revealing putative functions known for other orthoreoviruses. The segments L2, L3, M1, M3, S1, S2 and S3 each contain a single start AUG codon in close proximity to the 5' end. The L1 segment of MAHLV contains two AUG start codons in close proximity to the 5' end, at positions 14 and 19. AGCAUGG) . The open reading frame initiating at position 29 is 2031 nucleotides in length and putatively encodes for an outer capsid protein involved in membrane penetration during infection (muB). The second AUG initiates a 492 nucleotide open reading frame but the deduced amino acid sequence does not match any viral protein of note on Genbank. The deduced Sigma A protein of MAHLV (segment S1) contains the fusogenic orthoreovirus-wide conserved arginine amino acid at position 273. The S4 segment is bicistronic and encodes for a 14 kDa protein similar to p14 membrane fusion protein of Bush viper reovirus and a non-overlapping 18 kDa protein similar to p16 non-structural protein of Baboon orthoreovirus without a known function ( Table 4 ). The isoelectric point of MAHLV p18 is acidic (5.02), similar to that of p16 of Broome virus and Baboon orthoreovirus and contrary to that of other orthoreoviruses. The first ten amino acids in the putative 14 kDa protein of MAHLV are identical to the first ten amino acids in the p13 fusion protein of Broome virus and represent the myristoylation consensus sequence required for fusion activity of the protein. The S4 segment does not encode a cell attachment protein, an observation also characteristic of Broome virus and Baboon orthoreovirus. 1 63.0 54.3 53.9 63.1 63.8 63.3 63.6 64.7 \n",
            " MAHLV replicated efficiently in Vero cell culture, with the inoculum containing a high dose of virus (10 5 TCID 50 /mL) leading to rapid monolayer destruction after inoculation, with a peak in virus RNA (measured by real-time RT-PCR) by day 7, followed by a decrease on day 13. The inoculums containing a lower virus dose (10 4 and 10 3 TCID 50 /mL) resulted in a peak of RNA detection on day 13. All three above-mentioned inoculum doses yielded detectable virus RNA by day 4 after inoculation. The inoculum containing 10 1 TCID 50 /mL virus did not generate detectable viral RNA until day 7, and was still showing an upward trend on day 13 (last sampling day). The virus did not replicate in the insect cells (C6-36) up to day 13, but adaptation to these cells through serial passaging was not attempted.\n",
            " The role of bats in harbouring pathogens of public health and veterinary importance is becoming an increasingly popular topic of research within the field of emerging and zoonotic diseases. The most notable viruses in which natural transmission from bats have been implicated include filoviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, herpesviruses, lyssaviruses and bunyaviruses. The implication of bats in transmission or maintenance of some of these viruses is very circumstantial and often based only on serological evidence. More convincing evidence for others is based on detection of viral nucleic acid and isolation of live virus, although this does not conclusively prove that a vertebrate host is a reservoir. Finding pathogens in bats leads to the questions of how they are transmitted between bats, and from bats to incidental hosts such as humans. One possible transmission mechanism could be bat-associated hematophagous arthropods, such as the bat flies, but migration of parasites between bats is not well understood and would require further entomological investigation to better understand [13] .\n",
            " Two isolates of a novel fusogenic orthoreovirus were cultured and we determined their full genome sequences, which were compared to currently known viruses in the genus. The two isolates are not identical but similar enough to suggest that they are merely two isolates of the same virus. This suggests that there are multiple variants of the virus present in the host population. Members of a species within the Orthoreovirus genus are usually identified by a number of characteristics: amino acid and nucleotide sequence identity, organization of the polycistronic genome segment and host species [19] . For conserved core proteins, an amino acid identity >85% for homologous proteins indicates that two viruses belong to the same species, while identity <65% indicates a possible new species. When comparing the amino acid sequence of more divergent outer capsid proteins, >55% identity indicates one species and <35% indicates different species. Nucleic acid sequence identity of homologous segments of >75% indicates the same species and <60% a new species. The nature of conserved genome segment termini sequences of orthoreoviruses is also useful for virus classification [45] . The divergence of MAHLV sequence from other known orthoreoviruses combined with a unique conserved 5' genome segment end and a unique host species, suggests that this is a new virus species in this genus. Along with Broome virus and Baboon orthoreovirus, MAHLV is the third orthoreovirus that lacks an identified cell attachment protein in the S4 segment. This unique characteristic further strengthens the phylogenetic classification which places these viruses in a separate clade and suggests that entry of these viruses into cells is mediated differently than for other orthoreoviruses.\n",
            " Taking the abovementioned criteria and the sequence characteristics of the novel virus described here into consideration, we propose that Mahlapitsi virus constitutes a new species within the Orthoreovirus genus. To our knowledge this is the first description of an orthoreovirus in Africa with an indirect link to bats. Considering the rich diversity of bat species found on the continent and increased scientific interest in this field, this is unlikely to be the only such virus to be isolated from bat ectoparasites in years to come. However, to our knowledge this is the first orthoreovirus to be isolated from an arthropod host, since all currently known viruses in this genus are associated with vertebrates.\n",
            " MAHLV did not replicate on C6-36 cells in this study but Aedes albopictus, from which the C6-36 cell line is derived, is classified in a completely different dipteran family, the Culicidae, likely pointing to a cell receptor incompatibility. Another possible explanation could be the temperature at which insect cells are cultured compared to mammalian cells, which might be incompatible with this virus.\n",
            " The arthropod-borne nature of MAHLV transmission needs further investigation, especially to establish whether nycteribiid flies are only involved in mechanical or possibly biological transmission, and if the virus is even transmitted to bats. Various other genera in the Reoviridae family contain vector-borne viruses, including Banna virus (Seadornavirus), Colorado tick fever virus (Coltivirus) and Bluetongue virus (Orbivirus). Our isolation of MAHLV from arthropods might direct some attention to the possible role of insects in the transmission of currently known orthoreoviruses, or possibly the presence of other yet unknown viruses in various arthropods. We have no information on the geographical range of MAHLV, but the wide distribution of Rousettus aegyptiacus in Africa and the Middle East [46] , and the strict host preference and specificity of bat flies [13] [14] [15] , dictate that their ranges will overlap.\n",
            " We have no data to suggest that MAHLV has any human health implication, but this warrants further investigation. The virus grows to high titers in Vero E6 cells which suggests that it may infect vertebrates, although growth in in vitro systems cannot be translated directly into replication in a vertebrate host. It is important to note, also, that this was after blind passage and cell culture adaptation (CPE noted after two-three blind passages). Any risk of human infection for now, however, is only likely in individuals who come into close contact with wild Egyptian fruit bats and their ectoparasites. Although highly host-dependent, the bat flies have been noted to leave their bat hosts and crawl on bat researchers (personal observation). Respiratory disease has been noted in humans infected with Melaka, Kampar and Nelson bay orthoreovirus, including limited human-to-human transmission [22, 23, 32, 33] . Thus the potential for MAHLV to infect humans, and spread between humans, cannot be excluded until further investigation is done, especially considering that the virus grows very efficiently on a monkey-derived cell line.\n",
            " In conclusion, we have identified a novel orthoreovirus which we propose should constitute a new species within the genus. Two virus strains were isolated from ectoparasitic bat flies collected from Egyptian fruit bats from a South African cave roost. This represents the first isolation of an orthoreovirus from arthropods and the first African virus in this genus with an indirect link to bats.\n",

            "Body Text: Allotransplantation can be associated with transmission of microorganisms which induce severe diseases in the recipient [1, 2] . Among the transmitted microorganisms are bacteria [3] and viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus-1 [4] , rabies virus [5] [6] [7] , and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [8] . Infection with HCMV is a common complication after transplantation of different organs and contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality, both by direct and indirect mechanisms [9] . Therefore, HCMV status has to be determined and transplantations from HCMV-positive individuals to HCMV-negative individuals are generally avoided (for review see [8, 9] ). If necessary, an antiviral treatment is available and new antiviral drugs are under development [10] . Xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues, and organs may also be associated with transmission of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and others from the donor pig [11] . Transmission of porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) with the transplant and its increased replication, also called reactivation, on the background of the absence of the pig immune system and of the applied immunosuppression in the non-human primate recipient, was observed after pig kidney transplantations into baboons [12] or cynomolgus monkeys [13] . Transmission of PCMV was also observed after pig heart transplantations into baboons [14] . Although the virus titre in the recipients increases, it is unclear whether PCMV is able to infect cells of the recipient or is replicating only in the cells of the transplant.\n",
            " There are obvious differences between the transmission inside the human species during allotransplantation and transspecies transmission into a new species during xenotransplantation. Human microorganisms are adapted to humans and can be easily transmitted [1] [2] [3] [4] 8, 9] . The porcine methods should be. At the very least, in order to prevent transmission during xenotransplantation, the sensitivity of the detection methods should allow for the detection of the virus below the load which is able to be transmitted and to induce zoonosis [44] . We also indicate different strategies to eliminate the viruses from the donor pig herd in order to prevent transmission to human recipients.\n",

In some cases, PCVs were detected simultaneously with other porcine viruses using multiplex PCR [51, 52] . Other detection methods are antibody-based methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . The use of saliva for antibody detection gained popularity because of the ease of use and associated cost-saving [59] . Serum antibodies to PCV1 and PCV2 have been demonstrated in a large percentage of pigs in different countries at a time when vaccination had not yet been introduced [60] . PCR screening in the year 2000 of randomly collected 109 organ samples from German pigs not affected with PCVD revealed a rate of infection with PCV1 of 5% and with PCV2 of 26.8% [46] . Seroconversion usually occurs by two to four months of age irrespective of whether clinical signs of PCVD are observed. PCV2 is shed for a long time by different routes, both after natural as well as experimental infection [61, 62] . Therefore, it easily spreads within the population, mainly by direct contact with contaminated respiratory, digestive, and urinary secretions. Although PCV2 has been identified in the semen of acutely affected boars, transmission of the virus via this route has not been documented in a field setting [63, 64] .\n",
            " Based on phylogenetic analysis, PCV2 is divided into different genotypes (PCV2a, PCV2b, PVC2c, PCV2d, PCV2e, PCV2f) [65] .

In recent years, evidence has accumulated for a global shift of the main PCV2 genotypes in different countries from PCV2a to PCV2b, which is generally associated with more severe disease symptoms [68, 69] . PCV2d was initially identified in Switzerland, now it appears to be widespread in China and North America. During 2012-2013, 37% of all investigated PCV2 sequences from U.S. pigs were classified as PCV2d, and overall data analysis suggests an ongoing genotype shift from PCV2b towards PCV2d [70] .

            " Since changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic regions used as targets for PCR-detection of PCV may result in false-negative findings, the primers must be checked routinely by a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search of GenBank for their fitness to detect new variants. If no highly conserved regions can be identified and problems related to genomic variation are anticipated, multiplex PCRs for different viral variants using more than one primer pair or next generation sequencing can be employed.\n",
            " Recently, a new virus, PCV3, with significant differences in the sequence when compared with PCV1 and PCV2, but more related to a bat-faeces associated circovirus, was described in pigs with cardiac and multi-organ inflammation [74] . Since the pigs were co-infected with other porcine viruses, the pathogenicity of PCV3 warrants further investigations. PCV3 was found to be associated with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), reproductive failure, and multisystemic inflammation in China [75, 76] and in the USA [77] . Sequence analysis showed that the Chinese isolates are the result of a recombination between bat circoviruses [76] , and the closest relative of the U.S.A. isolate is a canine circovirus [77] .\n",
            " PCVD was first detected in the early 1990s and has since then emerged as an economically important pig disease worldwide [61] . The main disease induced by PCV2 is PMWS [41, 42] . However, PCV2 induces an entire complex of diseases now called PCVD in Europe or PCV-associated disease (PCVAD) in North America [33] . PCVD can be subdivided into PCV2-systemic disease (PCV2-SD, directly replacing PMWS), PCV2-subclinical infection (PCV2-SI), PCV2-reproductive disease (PCV2-RD), and PDNS. PCV2 is necessary but not sufficient for the induction of PCVD. Some purported risk factors include coinfection with other viruses. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of these viruses, it causes the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome associated with reproductive failure in breeding stocks and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. Co-infection with porcine parvovirus may also contribute to PCVD as well as nonspecific immune stimulation (e.g., by vaccination).\n",
            " Clinical signs of the disease include gradual wasting, fever, rough hair coat, dyspnea, pallor, diarrhea, and occasionally icterus. PCVD is characterized by lymphoid depletion, immunosuppression, and inflammation in affected organs. Morbidity varies from 2%-30%, but case fatality is high, approaching 80%. Occasionally, pigs may develop purple skin lesions and nephropathy, likely as an immune mediated sequel to viral infection, termed PDNS [78, 79] . Occasionally reproductive failure is observed as abortions, stillbirths, and mummification (PCV2-RD) [62, 80, 81] .\n",
            " When trying to infect human cell lines with PCV1 and PCV2, PCV1 persisted in most cell lines without causing any visible changes, while PCV2-transfected cells showed a cytopathogenic effect [82] . Most importantly, in both cases the infection was non-productive [82, 83] . Infection with PCV1 was observed in human 293, HeLa, and Chang liver cells, whereas PCV2 infected only human Rd cells [82] . Although it is well known that, in addition to PCV2, outbreaks of PCVD in pigs require cofactors (e.g., PRRSV), co-infecting human cells with PCV2 and PRRSV was not yet performed. In addition to cell lines, primary human leukocytes could also be infected with PCV1, inducing severe morphological alterations in the infected cells [84] , indicating that PCV1 may also be pathogenic.\n",
            " When humans were screened for antibodies against PCV, in an early study, antibodies to PCV were found in 30% of samples from hospitalized patients with fever of unknown etiology [85] . These results are in striking contrast to those from another group that did not detect antibodies in serum samples from the general population and from veterinarians working with PCVD affected animals [61] . Additional studies are necessary to confirm the latter negative results.\n",
            " A large \"experiment\" testing the susceptibility of the human population to PCV was involuntary conducted when two vaccines against rotaviral gastroenteritis from two different manufacturers were found to be contaminated with PCV1 and PCV2 [86] [87] [88] . Both contaminated vaccines had been used world-wide for a number of years, preventing disease and saving millions of children's lives [89, 90] . Over 10 5 or 10 6 particle-associated full-length PCV1 genomes were present in each dose of the contaminated vaccine [83, [87] [88] [89] , and cell culture assays in swine testis and PCV-free porcine kidney (PK-15) cells confirmed that PCV1 sequences in this vaccine represented infectious virus [86] [87] [88] 91] . Another rotavirus vaccine contained only subgenomic PCV1 and PCV2 fragments, but no full-length PCV genomes, and cell culture assays did not amplify PCV from this vaccine [88] . When stool samples from children vaccinated with Rotarix, an oral live attenuated vaccine based on the human rotavirus RIX4414 produced by GlaxoSmithKline (London, UK), were analyzed, in 4 of 40 samples PCV1 DNA was detected [83] . PCV1 DNA was detected only soon after vaccination, indicating that viral replication did not occur in the gastrointestinal tract. Antibodies were not detected in the sera of vaccinated children, confirming that no replication of the virus had taken place. The pattern of adverse events reported in vaccinated infants with PCV1 in their stool did not differ from that observed in placebo recipients [83] . This correlated with the reports that the Rotarix vaccine in general had nearly no adverse events [89, 90] .\n",
            " However-and this is the main question in the context of xenotransplantation-up until now it is still unknown whether PCV is zoonotic in severely immunosuppressed humans.\n",
            " In all of the clinical xenotransplantation trials documented in Paradise et al. [92] , no screening for PCV was performed in the Large White donor pigs and human recipients. Auckland Island pigs were used as source for the first clinical pig islet cell transplantation to human diabetic patients in New Zealand and Argentina [93] [94] [95] [96] . These donor animals were free of PCV1 and PCV2, and therefore could not transmit circoviruses [94] . The sensitivity of the PCR used to detect PCV in Auckland Island pigs was estimated to be 10 6 mg of DNA per reaction [97] . Islet cells from Auckland Island pigs were also used in a prospective pig-to-primate islet xenotransplantation study, and as expected, no PCV was transmitted [98] . In most of the reported pig-to-non-human primate transplantations, no screening for PCV was performed, with the exception of a the just mentioned trial transplanting islet cells from Auckland Island pigs into cynomolgus monkeys [98] . In addition, pig donors for islet cell transplantation into mice had also been found to be PCV-negative [99] . Recently, islet cells from Large White/Yorkshire landrace F1 pigs were transplanted into non-immunosuppressed cynomolgus monkeys, and no PCV was detected in the recipients [100] . Testing was performed based on the presence of PCV in the source herd, although the donor pigs had been vaccinated with CircoFLEX (Table 1 ). PCV was not tested in the monthly herd screening and in the sentinel and pancreas donor post-mortem screening, the islet cells had been encapsulated in macrobeads. In future preclinical, as well as clinical trials, donor pigs-and, if necessary, also recipients-should be screened for the presence of circoviruses. When PCV is not found in the donor pig, no screening of the recipients needs to be performed.\n",
            " There is no specific treatment for pigs with PCVD. Anti-inflammatory agents and antimicrobials may help to suppress co-factors and secondary diseases associated with PCVD. All in/all out pig flow, thorough cleaning, and rigid disinfection between batches of pigs are measures that can help control the disease [103] . In the case that the donor animal is PCV-infected, it may be considered to analyze whether the xenotransplantation product (e.g., isolated islet cells) is still negative. Since PCV2 is infecting macrophages, certainly all organs are infected and it will be safer to use only negative animals, especially since no effective antiviral treatment is available. PCV2 infection is associated with an immune response including neutralising antibodies, and these coincide with a decrease in serum virus load. Cell-mediated immunity has also been shown to be necessary to control PCV2 infection (for review see [102] ). PCV2 vaccines became commercially available in the summer of 2006 (Table 1 ) [103] . The vaccines reduced the severity and incidence rate of PCVD on many farms. Vaccination against PCV2 did not only imply a direct beneficial effect on pig productivity, but also contributed to reduction of antimicrobial use [104] . PCV2 vaccines effectively increased average daily weight gain (ADWG) and prevented diseases with a positive result for meat production. In all vaccination trials a lower virus load was registered in the vaccinated animals, however, it remains unclear whether the virus load is reduced to zero. In most reported cases, virus transmission took place despite vaccination [102, [105] [106] [107] . In a study vaccinating 28 pigs, the virus load was not reduced to zero in any of the animals [108] . In another study, 17 of 32 vaccinated animals still showed PCV in the serum, as measured by PCR [90] . PCV2 vaccination of sows was associated with high antibody responses, but did not prevent fetal infections in utero or soon after birth by infectious colostrum in 29 of 100 cases [107] . When comparing four different vaccines, use of the inactivated chimeric vaccines (Fostera PCV and Circovax) resulted in significantly lower viremia compared with use of the subunit vaccines (Circoflex, Porcilis PCV), however, histopathological lesions and PCV antigens were still detected in all 80 immunized animals [109] . Successful vaccination is mainly associated with induction of neutralizing antibodies, but T cell-mediated immunity also plays a role in the reduction of the virus load and prevention of diseases as mentioned above [102, 110] .\n",
            " Since new PCV2 variants have emerged, the question of whether or not current vaccines can protect against new PCV2 variants that may be more virulent for pigs becomes a serious concern. Although it is still unclear whether the global switch from PCV2a to PCV2b and PCV2d was associated with higher fitness of PCV2, as reported [68, 69] , rather than vaccine induced selection pressure, the emergence and rapid spread of new PCV2 variants provide evidence that current vaccines need to be updated.\n",
            " For a safe xenotransplantation, elimination programs have been proposed for porcine viruses such as HEV [17] , PCMV [111] , porcine lymphotropic herpesviruses, and others [112] , by isolation of virus-free animals, treatment, and vaccination. Elimination programs in the case of circoviruses should be based on (i) selection of animals found non-infected using highly sensitive detection methods to avoid false-negative testing; (ii) vaccination or other strategies (see below), since treatment is not available; and (iii) isolation of virus-negative animals to prevent de novo infection. Elimination means elimination from the herd, elimination from a single individual is impossible, since there is no treatment presently available. The efficacy of the vaccines should be improved and new vaccines against emerging variant virus strains should be developed. Since PCV2 is easily transmitted through the placenta and since colostrum was shown to be infectious, Cesarean section, and colostrum derivation are two promising strategies to eliminate PCV [80, 106, 107, 113] . Recent findings of PCV2 in Göttingen Minipigs [114] , which were introduced into the facility by Cesarean delivery and are produced under specified pathogen-free breeding conditions that are very similar to designated pathogen-free breeding conditions [115] , confirm transmission through the placenta and indicate that selection of PCV2-free animals may be difficult. However, when 384 embryos recovered from PCV2 infected pigs 10 days after inoculation were transferred to seronegative donors, no infection of the recipient pig and the piglets was observed, indicating that embryo transfer can be successfully used for the elimination of PCV2 [116] .\n",
            " PCV2 is a very small virus, it is stable and resistant to some disinfectants, pH, and heat, and it induces severe diseases in infected pigs. PCV2 is an immunosuppressive virus and it is still unclear whether subclinical infections of pigs may decrease the functionality of the organs required for transplantation. Vaccination against PCV2 is able to prevent diseases, but in most cases is unable to prevent the transmission of the virus. Although PCV2 infects human cells and induces a cytopathic effect in vitro, no pathogenic effects were observed when PCV was transmitted by contaminated vaccines to children. It remains unknown whether PCV may infect severely immunosuppressed individuals. In conclusion, for all of these reasons, sensitive detection methods should be used to screen for the virus and improved vaccination, Cesarean delivery, colostrum deprivation, and embryo transfer should be used to prevent transmission of the virus.\n",

            "Title: Highly potent multivalent VHH antibodies against Chikungunya isolated from an alpaca naïve phage display library Open Access Journal of Nanobiotechnology †\n",
            "Body Text: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the causative agent of chikungunya fever (CHIKF), generally causing febrile, arthralgia/arthritis, and rash. The virus is mainly transmitted by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Human CHIKV infection was first reported in Tanzania in 1953 when the pathogen caused the first major outbreak [1] . In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) first described CHIKF \"A re-emerging disease in Asia\" as a call to increase attention to CHIKV worldwide [2] . In the past decades, CHIKF is prevalent in the Pacific region and Latin America with millions of cases reported over 100 countries [3] [4] [5] . A recent outbreak occurred at the China-Myanmar border in 2019, which was imported from Myanmar to Ruili City, Yunnan Province, China. Being highly infectious, it is considered one of the fastest spreading mosquito-borne diseases following malaria and dengue. As there are no licensed antiviral treatments or vaccines available for the CHIKV infection, early diagnosis is critical. While the mortality rate is low for CHIKV infections, they are likely to be misdiagnosed.\n",
            " CHIKV is an enveloped single-stranded RNA Alphavirus [6] . The mature infectious CHIKV is a ~ 70 nm icosahedral enveloped particle in diameter, composed of transmembrane glycoproteins E1, E2, and E3. E1 and E2 glycoproteins assemble into heterodimers with 80 trimeric spikes on the surface of the virions [7, 8] . E1 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates the fusion of virus and the host cell membrane [9, 10] . E3 is responsible for the folding of the E2-E1 heterodimer but is cleaved during post-translational maturation [11] . E2 is composed of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains located at the center of an N-terminal domain A, the lateral tip of domain B, and at the lateral tip of a C-terminal domain C. Domain A and domain B are considered to be the binding sites of the Mxra8 receptor on the target cell [12] . Because of this structural advantage, CHIKV glycoprotein E2 appears to be immunodominant with multiple identified epitopes which induce neutralizing antibodies and therefore has a higher serodiagnostic potential.\n",
            " Nanobodies are single variable domains on heavy chain (VHH) antibodies of molecular weight ~ 15 kDa that are derived from camelid and cartilaginous heavy-chain only antibodies [13, 14] . As the smallest functional antibody, it is widely studied both in vitro and in vivo. Compared to conventional antibodies, VHHs are highly stable and soluble, easily purified from E. coli, and typically have nanomolar binding affinities [15] [16] [17] . Specifically, the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of nanobodies play a key role in recognizing cavities or hidden epitopes such as the virus-binding site of a cell surface receptor [18] and the active site of an enzyme [19, 20] . Screening of VHH antibodies from the naïve library is the superior option for fast diagnosis and efficient treatment. For example, Dong, et al. [21] and Huo, et al. [22] identified the high-affinity nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 from naïve llama VHH libraries that bind to the S/ RBD protein and block its interaction with ACE2. Similarly, Yan, et al. [23] recognized two human procalcitonin (PCT) nanobodies from the naïve phage display library and successfully applied them to develop a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which showed a linear range of PCT between 10-1000 ng/mL.\n",
            " The current gold standard of CHIKV diagnosis is using virus isolation or virus genome detection assays. Compared to cell culture, fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis is a viable alternative method for viral nucleic acid testing. However, qRT-PCR is problematic due to complicated nucleic acid extraction, which requires highly demanding experimental conditions, is time-consuming, and has an extremely high miss-detection rate [24] . Detection of virions using antibody-based ELISA is a simple and effective approach for identifying and quantitating antigens. To the best of our knowledge, commercial ELISAs are only available for detecting the antibodies for CHIKV (i.e., IgM and IgG). However, commercial rapid ELISA tests for detecting CHIKV antigens are not available. Continued trade and international travel growth may also increase the probability of the emergence of vector viruses. Screening individuals with fever for CHIKV infections using rapid diagnostic tests at airports or customs are warranted. This practice can reduce the risk of importing infections to mainland China.\n",
            " Here, we generated 20 VHH antibodies using a naïve phage display library for binders to the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. Considering the advantages of activity and affinity, Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were selected as the focus of the present study. Our results suggested that both antibodies could bind to CHIKV E2 protein and virus particles as well as recognize different epitopes. In addition, a 100-fold increase in affinity for the E2 glycoprotein was observed when two VHH antibodies were constructed into multivalent formats. This result can be used for diagnostic applications to detect sera binding proteins and/or virions, either as single VHHs or in combination.\n",
            " Vero cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 5% CO 2 , 37 ℃. Chikungunya/human/China/GD134/2010 (Gen-Bank Accession: HQ846359) was isolated from the serum of an infected female patient at Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Zika/human/China/GD01/2016 (GenBank Accession: KU740184) was isolated from Guangdong inbound passengers. All experiments involving the CHIKV and ZIKA authentic virus were conducted in biosafety level 2 or higher laboratories. Virus virions were inactivated using β-propiolactone (Sigma-Aldrich) with a concentration of 1:2000 at 4 ℃ for 24 h. Complete inactivation of the virus was confirmed by the lack of replication in a Vero infection experiment. Supernatants containing virus particles were concentrated using PEG-it (SBI Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C and resuspended in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, pH7.4) for further use.\n",
            " A VHH phage display library (AlpaLife) of ~ 2 × 10 9 cfu was generated using the phagemid vector pADL-10b. Escherichia coli (E.coli) SS320 cells containing the VHH library were infected with helper phage M13KO7 to produce phages displaying the encoded VHHs as fusion proteins. Biopanning of phages displaying VHHs specific to the Chikungunya/SL-CK1 E2 (Sino Biological) glycoprotein was performed as described previously [25, 26] . After three rounds of panning, 384 individual clones were picked to inoculate 2 × YT (yeast extract tryptone) medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin overnight at 37 °C. The cell-free phage supernatant was detected by phage-ELISA with HRP-conjugated goat anti-M13 IgG antibody (Sino Biological). OD 450 values ≥ 0.5 and P (positive OD 450 )/N (negative OD 450 ) greater than 3 P/N ratios were determined as positive clones. Positive candidates were sequenced (Sangon Biotech) and aligned with CDRs amino acid sequence. A five percent bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative control for each round.\n",
            " For monovalent VHH antibodies, sequences were synthesized (Generay Biotech) and subcloned into pET-SUMO with a tandem N-terminal His-tag, SUMO-tag. Recombinant plasmids were subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Protein expression was carried out overnight at 18 °C after 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction at OD 600 0.6. The His-tagged protein was purified by Talon Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer. The eluates were concentrated using a 1.5 mL Microsep advance centrifugal device (PALL) with a molecular weight cut-off of 3 kDa. Purity quality was analyzed by Coomassie-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\n",
            " Bivalent and trivalent VHHs were fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 and cloned into the pcDNA 3.4. Multivalent VHH units were connected through (GGGGS) × 3 flexible linkers. The Fc-fusion constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells at 8% CO 2 at 37 °C for 1 week. Antibodies in the supernatant were purified using protein A. Purity of all samples was analyzed by size-exclusion highperformance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC).\n",
            " The size and structure of VHHs were analyzed by negative stain TEM and NTA. 10 µL of an aqueous solution of samples were applied to copper mesh grids (400 mesh). After deposition for 5 min, the excessive solution was removed with filter paper. Drops of 3% phosphotungstic acid stained on the grid for three minutes and observed on a TEM (JEM-1200EX, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). All samples were diluted in PBS before measurement on a NanoSight NS300 instrument (Malvern, Worchestershire, UK). Data acquisition and processing were performed using NTA software 3.3. Each sample was recorded three times in 30 s, with detection threshold 3.\n",
            " Microtiter plates (Corning) were coated with 2 µg/mL CHIKV E2, 10 µg/mL purified virus virions or the control protein SUMO in a carbonate buffer (CBS, pH9.6) overnight at 4 °C, and blocked with 3% BSA(Sigma-Aldrich) PBS (pH7.4) at 37 ℃. Serial tenfold dilutions of the SUMO-tagged VHHs in 3% BSA were incubated with the immobilized antigen, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-SMT3 (1:2000, CUSABIO). After wash, 100μL of TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate (TIANGEN) was added to the wells, and reactions were stopped with 100μL of 1 M HCl. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm on an Epoch ™ microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The EDIII protein of ZIKA was used as the negative control.\n",
            " Purified CHIKV E2 proteins (20 μg) and CHIKV virions (50 μg) were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). Following blocking with 5% BSA in 1 × TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.05%Tween-20), the membranes were incubated overnight with 1:500 dilution of antibodies. Membranes were probed with an SMT3-HRP conjugated antibody (1:1000, CUSABIO), and revealed with the SuperSignal West Dura ECL reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chemiluminescence images were visualized with the FluorChem E scanner system (ProteinSimpleSan, Jose, CA, USA).\n",
            " LSPR measurements were performed using an OpenSPRTM instrument (Nicoyalife) to determine the affinity of monovalent VHH antibodies to the E2 protein. The COOH chip (Nicoyalife, Canada) was loaded onto the OpenSPRTM instrument following the standard OpenSPRTM procedure. The test was run with PBS (pH7.4) at the maximum flow rate (150µL/min) to reach the signal baseline. A sample 200µL isopropanol run for 10 s to evacuate the air. After the baseline was reached, the PBS buffer was rinsed through the sample loop and evacuated with air. Slow down the flow rate of PBS (pH7.4) to 20µL/min, and then load 200µL of EDC/NHS (1:1) solution to activate the COOH sensor chip. 200µL of ligand E2 protein (0.4 mg/mL) was diluted for 4 min and the sample was rinsed with PBS (pH7.4). The sample with 200µL blocking solution and the sample loop was rinsed with PBS and evacuated with air. The baseline was observed for 5 min to ensure stability. Selected antibodies were diluted into a series of different concentrations and sampled at 20µL/min. Both antibodies and ligand binding times were 240 s and natural dissociation was 360 s. Kinetic parameters for the binding reactions were calculated using Trace Drawer software (Ridgeview Instruments AB), One to One analytical model.\n",
            " A fragment of cDNA encoding the Mouse-Mxra8 extracellular domain (residues 23-336, GenBank accession number NM_024263.4) or Human-Mxra8 extracellular domain (residues 24-337, GenBank accession number NM_032348.3) was appended with a TEV enzyme site and a human IgG1 Fc at the C-terminus as well as the IL-2 signal peptide at the N-terminus in pcDNA 3.4 expression vectors and transiently transfected into HEK293 cells followed by media collection and purification using protein A sepharose. The Mxra8-Fc binding assay was adapted from the previously described [27] . MaxiSorp ELISA plates (Corning) were coated with 2 µg/ mL anti-mouse CHKV E2 monoclonal antibodies in CBS (pH9.6) overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed four times with PBS and blocked with 4% BSA(Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). CHIKV virions (1 µg/ ml) were diluted and added for 1 h at RT. After washing, MoNb-2E8 and MoNb-3C5 or Mouse Mxra8-Fc fusion protein (all at 10 µg/ml) were incubated for 30 min. Plates were washed and Human Mxra8-Fc (tenfold serial dilutions) were added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at RT. Plates were washed again and incubated with secondary rabbit anti-human IgG-Fc (1:5000, Bioss). After washing, the plates were developed with TMB substrate (TIANGEN) and 2 N H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm.\n",
            " An indirect immunofluorescence assay was developed on CHIKV-infected Vero cells, as previously described [28] . Briefly, infected cells (multiplicity of infection (MOI), 1) were cultured for 72 h and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Biosharp) for 20 min. PFA-fixed cells were permeabilized and blocked with 1% Triton X-100(MP)/1% BSA(Sigma-Aldrich)/PBS for 1 h at RT. The cells were incubated with antibodies (10 μg/mL) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by Alexa Fluor 488 Anti-6 × His tag antibody (Abcam) or Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Beyotime) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Mshot). Anti-CHIKV rabbit serum was obtained from a rabbit immunized with β-propiolactone CHIKV GD134 virion and used as a positive control. Anti-CHIKV E1 mouse IgG antibody (R&D Systems) was used as a control antibody.\n",
            " The binding of antibodies to the virus on the cell surface was assessed by flow cytometry assay. Monolayers of Vero cells were infected with CHIKV and ZIKA at an MOI of 0.1 and harvested at 48 h post-infection. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with permeabilization buffer (0.05% Triton-X in PBS). Cells were incubated on ice for 60 min with 10 μg/ml antibodies. After washing twice with PBS, cells were stained with 1:1000 diluted goat anti-human H&L (FITC) or FITC rabbit polyclonal to 6 × His tag (Abcam) for 45 min and analyzed using flow cytometry (Beckman CytoFlex, Brea, CA, USA).\n",
            " As secondary antibodies, bivalent VHHs were coupled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) performed using a HRP Conjugation Kit (Abcam) following manufacturer instructions. 2 μg/mL of BiNb-2E8 in CBS (pH9.6) was added per well of a coated 96-well plate at 4 ℃ overnight. After washing with PBST and blocking with 5% BSA in PBST for 1 h, 100 μL of the E2 protein were diluted in a two-fold dilution series (starting dilution 5 in 10,240) or human sera samples (dilution 1:10) were added and incubated at RT for 1 h. Wells were washed 3 × 5 min, and 100μL of HRP labeled BiNb-3C5 (1 μg/mL) was added to each. After 1 h of incubation, plates were washed 5 times with PBST. TMB was added to the wells for colorimetric development and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. Human Mxra8-Fc served as the control. Samples were considered seropositive if OD 450 values were higher than the mean obtained for the negative samples plus 3 standard deviations. The CHIKV positive sera samples were sourced from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Southern Theater Command. Twenty CHIKV negative sera from healthy subjects were used for the calculation and validation of the cut-off value and were excluded from the sample matrix.\n",
            " A pool of 10-mer peptides with 5 amino acid overlap spanning the Chikungunya/SL-CK1 E2 glycoprotein was generated by chemistry to a purity of 90% (GL Biochem). All peptides were provided as a lyophilized powder, reconstituted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and stored at − 80 °C. Each peptide was coated at 1ug/mL in CBS (pH9.6) overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 5% BSA(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBST. An irrelevant SARS-CoV-2 peptide was used as the negative control. The binding of the coated peptide was characterized by incubation with 2 µg/mL antibodies. Mouse monoclonal anti-6 × His tag HRP-conjugated (Abcam) was used at 1:5000 dilution in the blocking buffer, and further absorbance measurements of the enzymatic reaction in TMB substrate (TIANGEN), were used to detect the bound epitopes.\n",
            " The homology model of protein structure was built on the DeepMind algorithm AlphaFold system (https:// deepm ind. com/). The complex model of Nb-2E8 or Nb-3C5 to the CHIKV E2 protein was generated by pyDOCK (https:// life. bsc. es/ pid/ pydoc kweb). All structural data of the docking models were visualized using the PyMOL software (https:// pymol. org/2/).\n",
            " All experiments were replicated at least two times, and representative data or pooled data from repeat experiments were recorded. Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism Software (San Diego, CA, USA). Data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).

            " VHH antibodies have become increasingly accessible using high-throughput naïve libraries to rapidly recognize multiple target antigens while resisting adverse biochemical properties such as instability, multi-reactivity, and aggregation during affinity maturation [29, 30] . To obtain active protein-binding clones from the enriched library, we conducted three rounds of screening (Fig. 1a) and examined for specific protein-binding using a phage ELISA. Additional file 2: Table S1 showed that the phage clones specific to the CHIKV E2 protein were effectively enriched through consecutive selection rounds. A total of 119 positive clones were included for genomic sequencing and data analyses (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). After CDRs sequence analysis, 20 unique CHIKV E2 specific antibodies were identified ( Fig. 1b and 1c) . These sequences were clustered into several discrete groups based on VHH similarities (Fig. 1d) .\n",
            " Using the prokaryotic system in E.coli strain BL21(DE3), we expressed recombinant VHH antibodies with N-terminally 6 × His-and SUMO-tagged proteins (Fig. 2a) . The expressed antibodies can exist as intracellular soluble and active proteins mostly found in the lysate supernatant (Additional file 1: Fig. S1 ). However, Nb-4C1 and Nb-4G10 were aggregated into inclusion bodies in the E.coli cytoplasm (Additional file 1: Fig. S1 ). Soluble VHHs were further purified by cobalt-chelating sepharose columns using 250 mM imidazole for elution. Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE showed the recombinant proteins were detected at the expected apparent molecular weights, which was ~ 28 kDa (Fig. 2b) . To confirm the specificity of binding of the 20 candidate VHH antibodies, CHIKV E2 as coating antigen was carried out by indirect ELISA (Additional file 1: Fig. S2 ). Of these, Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were found to specifically bind with the E2 protein as well as CHIKV virion (Fig. 2d) . Western blot analysis showed that both Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were able to recognize the purified CHIKV virion and the E2 protein (Fig. 2c) . The results suggested that both antibodies recognize linear epitopes on CHIKV E2. Moreover, NTA analysis revealed the particles in the size range characteristic for Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 (< 100 nm) (Fig. 2e) . The morphology of VHHs was further confirmed by TEM (Fig. 2f ) .\n",
            " To validate the binding capabilities of the antibodies targeting the E2 protein, we measured the binding kinetics of antibodies by LSPR. While MoNb-2E8 and MoNb-3C5 have an affinity of 101 nM and 368 nM (Fig. 3a) , they showed a weak affinity with the E2 protein. We also evaluated whether Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 compete with Mxra8-Fc to bind with CHIKV. Both Human Mxra8-Fc and Mouse Mxra8-Fc could non-competitively bind to CHIKV (Fig. 3c) . This would explain that Nb-2E8, Nb-3C5, and Mxra8 interact at different sites with virions and most likely do not compete for the same epitope. Nb-2E8, Nb-3C5, and anti-rabbit serum were used as primary antibodies to detect the expression of the viral E2 protein in Vero cells at 72 h post-infection. Figure 3b showed that specific green and red fluorescence were observed in the virus-infected cells, but not in virusuninfected cells. Further confirmation of the binding specificity of the VHHs was accomplished by flow cytometry analysis of infected cells labeled with Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 (Fig. 3d) . Blue boxes, the proportion of cells in which the fluorescence value exceeded the gating threshold. Quantifications presented in ratios of fluorescencepositive cells to the total number of cells, revealed that the FITC-positive values of CHIKV infected cells were visibly higher than ZIKA infected cells (P < 0.05).\n",
            " To further improve the affinity of VHH antibodies against CHIKV E2, Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were fused to an Fc domain of IgG1 to generate multivalent fusion proteins and obtain milligram quantities of highly pure (> 95%) recombinant proteins (Fig. 4a, 4b , and Additional file 2: Table S3 ). BiNb-2E8, BiNb-3C5, TriNb-2E8, and TriNb-3C5 showed high binding affinities to CHIKV E2 with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of 2.59, 20.70, 4.52, and 10.40, respectively (Fig. 3a) . Cytofluorimetric quantification of BiNb-2E8 stained cells to the total number of cells was 95.81% and 95.20% for BiNb-3C5 (Additional file 1: Fig. S3 ).\n",
            " We developed a sandwich ELISA protocol, in which purified bivalent antibodies are used as the capture and different bivalent antibodies are used for detection, to quantify relative antigen response levels. From 4 independent experiments, the linear equation of Y = 6.908e-004 X + 0.7684 (r = 0.9864, P < 0.0001) was found to be the optimal linear fit, which demonstrated good linearity over the concentration range (5-1250 ng/mL) (Fig. 4c) . The BiNb-2E8 was combined as capture and the HRP-labelled BiNb-3C5 as detection to reveal a combination with good performance.\n",
            " To establish a baseline for the evaluation of the E2 antigen capture test, 20 CHIKV seronegative samples were analyzed. The cut-off was defined as the mean OD 450 value of the negative controls + 3SD: 0.0696 + (3 × 0.0128) = 0.108. Hence, sera samples giving OD 450 values higher than 0.108 were recorded as positive, and negative when OD 450 values were lower than 0.108. By this criterion, all 15 serum of patients infected with CHIKV had OD values greater than that of the cut-off value, which was judged as positive. Also, the difference between CHIKV seronegative and seropositive samples was significant s (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4d) . Therefore, the sandwich ELISA established in this study can be used in the early diagnosis of CHIKV viral infection.\n",
            " To characterize specific linear epitopes of the CHIKV E2 protein, 68 peptides with an offset of ten amino acids were used to assess responses (Additional file 2: Table S4 ). As shown in Fig. 5b , P61-GEEPNYQEEW and P10-LKIQVSLQIG strongly reacted with Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5, which correspond to the amino acid residues 331 to 340 and 46 to 55 of CHIKV E2 domain C and A, respectively (Fig. 5a) . Comparison of epitopes of the Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 with sequences from representative strains of each CHIKV genotype (SL-CK1, BR33, CU-Chik683, and Ross: East, Central, and South African (ECSA); RSU1: Asian; Senegal: West African) (Fig. 5c) . Of note is that the Nb-3C5 recognized epitope is highly conserved across the six-representative CHIKV genotypes. to map the binding of antibodies to the E2 protein. Like peptide-based ELISA, the formation of complex demonstrates Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 bind different epitopes on E2 (Fig. 5d) . In the complex, residues L98, G99, W100, T101, and L108 from the CDR3 loop of Nb-2E8 made contacts with the P61epitopes of E2. The CDR1 and CDR3 regions of Nb-3C5 have contributed to the P10 epitopes of domain C.\n",
            " Nanobody opens important possibilities for biomedical applications, but so far, most have been generated by immunized Camelidae, which is time-consuming and expensive for laboratories. Naïve phage display library, a technique for obtaining genetically engineered nanobodies against an antigen without immunization [31] , allowed the isolation of antibodies against autoantigens, nonimmunogenic, or toxic antigens. High-affinity antibodies can be obtained in a short time when the library capacity is sufficiently large. VHH, also namely nanobody, is tenfold smaller than conventional antibodies with unique advantages [32] . As a result of its small size and stability, it is easily incorporated into the body's natural metabolic pathways. More importantly, VHH domains have longer complementary antigen-binding regions CDR3, providing greater antigen-binding capacity, and the affinity of nanobodies can be further improved by genetic engineering techniques [33] . In this study, we performed genetically engineered VHH antibodies targeting of CHIKV by using a phage display technique based on a naïve antibody library derived from 103 healthy adult alpaca lymphocytes with a capacity of 2 × 10 9 cfu, which was able to screen for specific binding VHH antibodies. A total of 20 VHH sequences specifically binding to CHIKV E2 were obtained, including CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. The amino acid sequence length of the CDR3 region varies from 17 to 20, with 85% of the sequences greater than 17 amino acids, indicating typical characteristics of a nanobody. In framework region 2 (FR2), the high stability and solubility of VHH was attributed to the typical substitutions of hydrophobic residues. Altogether, the VHH antibody was a convenient monovalent scaffold, with the single-chain easily expressed in E. coli. The pET-SUMO expression system, which combines the pET plasmid with a SUMO partner linking the target gene to SUMO via a homologous recombination cloning strategy, is efficiently and stably expressed under the control of a strong T7 promoter [34] . The SUMO protein was an ideal candidate tag for enhancing the expression, folding, and stability of proteins [35, 36] , especially for heterologous proteins like antibody fragments [37] . Several studies have reported that recombinant proteins have been efficiently produced using the SUMO fusing system in E. coli [38] [39] [40] . The results from this study agree with the previous studies. VHH antibodies were secreted to the culture medium in a soluble form. An N-terminal 6 × His Tag was added to the expression vector to aid purification and, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a single band at approximately 28 kDa. However, two VHHs Nb-4C1 and Nb-4G10 were expressed in E. coli and refolded from inclusion bodies. We speculated that it can potentially be associated with VHH sequences.\n",
            " For purified VHH antibodies, following identification by ELISA, western blot, and IFA-mediated overlap experiment, Nb-2E8, and Nb-3C5, we have chosen for further validation. SPR technology is widely known as a golden standard for capturing antibody-antigen interactions [41, 42] . To determine the kinetic rate and affinity constants, binding analysis of E2 and monovalent antibodies were carried out by LSPR. LSPR results demonstrated that the binding affinity of MoNb-2E8 and MoNb-3C5 is relatively low. Recombinant fusions of monovalent antibodies are limited by weak binding affinity due to the lack of multivalent affinity benefits, poor production capacity, and potential immunogenicity [43] [44] [45] . To further improve the affinity of VHHs against CHIKV E2, homodimer (BiNb-2E8, BiNb-3C5) and homo-trimer (TriNb-2E8, TriNb-3C5) were fused to an Fc domain of IgG1 to generate multivalent fusion proteins. We surprisingly found that compared with the corresponding monovalent antibodies, both homo-dimer and homo-trimer showed a 100-fold enhancement towards the E2 protein. Among them, BiNb-2E8 was confirmed by LSPR analysis, with a binding affinity of ~ 2.59 nM. Developing high affinity and specific antibodies for capturing viral antigens is crucial for any point-of-care testing (POCT) such as ELISA to be successful. Thus, we capitalize on the strengths of the selected VHH antibodies to establish a rapid, convenient, and reliable screening test.\n",
            " A major advantage of the ELISA method is that it can detect viruses at a concentration of 1-10 µg/ml and require few antibodies [46] . Traditional antibodies considered for developing ELISA have been polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. However, these highly specific antibodies are cost-effective and have poor stability under adverse environmental conditions [47] . Nanobodies are powerful tools for a wide application in molecular biology, providing high affinity and antigen specificity. In this study, we prepare specific multivalent antibodies against the E2 protein and develop a double-antibody sandwich ELISA for the detection of antigen quality using BiNb-2E8 as capture antibodies and BiNb-3C5 as the detection antibodies. A good linear correlation was achieved in the 5-1000 ng/mL range. ELISA results showed that patients with CHIKV had significantly higher serum E2 levels than CHIKV seronegative (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the best choice for coated antibodies is to recognize only a single antigenic determinant [48] [49] [50] . Two types of diagnostic and protective antigens, ZIKA and SARS-CoV-2, were tested by indirect ELISA. Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were found to have no binding activity to react with the ZIKA and SARS-CoV-2 proteins without any dose-dependent manner. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis of the two VHHs of Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 positively stains CHIKVinfected cells but was negative on ZIKA-infected cells. Overall, Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were specific for CHIKV and had no cross-reactivity with ZIKA and SARS-CoV-2. These findings indicated that the ELISA protocol could be performed in any laboratory and served as the foundation of an inexpensive tool for the early diagnosis of CHIKV.\n",
            " An understanding of the interaction between the antibody and its targeted antigen, and knowing the epitopes, are critical for developing epitope-based diagnostic reagents. The epitopes recognized by the VHHs were identified by peptide-based ELISA, and the epitopes sites were located. Previous studies have reported that several monoclonal antibodies targeting the structure of the domain A and B could block fusion and inhibit interaction with cellular receptors [8, 51] . Epitope mapping revealed that Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 bound the different linear epitopes distributed in domain C and domain A, respectively. In particular, the P10-46 \"LKIQVSLQIG\" 55 has not been reported. But we had previously predicted that the peptide \"QVSLQIGIK\" was the immunodominant B-and T-cell epitope using in silico techniques (unpublished data). Several studies suggested that the P61-301 \"GEEP-NYQEEW\" 310 was found to be B-cell epitopes shared by humans and mice [52, 53] . Unfortunately, the selected two VHH antibodies that focus on the domains of the target linear epitopes are non-neutralizing. The main neutralization sites on the CHIKV E2 protein are likely to be available in a conformation-dependent manner, rather than as linear epitopes.\n",
            " Based on sequence alignment analysis, the P10 was completely conserved among all CHIKV genotype strains analyzed here, indicating that Nb-3C5 is potentially capable of recognizing three CHIKV genotypes (ECSA, Asian, and West African). It also found that the P61 epitope sequence in the West African lineage CHIKV strain had two single two amino acid differences from the other genotypes. This may limit the potential diagnostic applications of Nb-2E8 in countries where West African lineage strains of the virus circulate. However, all epitopes had significant amino acid mutations across other alphaviruses (Mayaro virus, O'nyong'nyong virus, Semliki Forest virus, Ross River virus, Sindbis virus, etc.). These features enable the differential diagnosis of CHIKV. Taken together, these VHH antibodies, Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5, specifically recognize different epitopes of the CHIKV E2 protein, which are the optimal pair of antibodies for the development of a double-antibody sandwich ELISA.\n",
            " There are several potential limitations to the study. First, our study is only focused on highly potent antibodies against CHIKV. Further studies are needed to demonstrate other VHH antibodies could interact with the E2 protein and to evaluate the diagnostic or treatment merit of specific antibodies. Second, the present study illustrates a strategy to mine the valuable VHH antibodies by naïve phage display library. The results support the feasibility of VHHs as a rapid diagnostic tool. However, the diagnostic accuracy parameters and procedures in this study have not been directly optimized. To establish a standardized CHIKV diagnostic process, the optimization of antibody reagents is required. Third, the binding site prediction of nanobody-E2 complex relies on peptide-ELISA and homology-modeling applications, which lacked X-ray diffraction (XRD) or cryoelectronic microscopy to investigate the crystal structure parameters.\n",
            " In summary, we developed VHH antibodies from a naïve phage display library that addresses the specific needs of CHIKV serodiagnosis. The selected antibodies of Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 could bind the CHIKV E2 protein with high specificity and affinity in a multivalent platform. These results suggest that the selected antibodies are used for diagnostic applications to detect sera binding protein and/or virions, either as single VHHs or in combination.\n",

            "Title: Polyomaviruses-associated respiratory infections in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children\n",
            "Body Text: Lower respiratory tract-infections (LRTIs) are a major cause of hospitalizations during childhood [1] . Determining pathogen specific causality of LRTIs is hampered by lack of sensitive methods for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia, as well as the concurrent identification of multiple respiratory-viral pathogens, particularly when using molecular assays [2] . Nevertheless, worldwide studies attribute a large proportion of LRTIs to viral infections [3, 4] . Largescale molecular screening based technologies have contributed to the discovery of new infectious pathogens, including in 2007 two polyomaviruses (PyV), WU-and KI-polyomavirus [5, 6] . These PyV belong to the Polyomaviridae family and have been associated with respiratory disease in humans, although direct evidence of causality is lacking [7] . Two other polyomaviruses (BKPyV and JCPyV) have been implicated in disease in immunocompromised patients [8] [9] [10] . There are, however, conflicting data with regard to the role of WUPyV and KIPyV in immunocompromised individuals [11] [12] [13] .\n",
            " Previous studies have used pneumococcal-conjugate-vaccine (PCV) randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) as a probe to establish the probability of co-infections by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) vaccine-serotypes and respiratory-virus in children hospitalized for pneumonia [14, 15] . The rational of this approach is that any biological-plausible difference between PCV-and placebo-recipients in the incidence of any disease which could be associated with vaccine-serotype pneumococcal infection would indicate a role of vaccine-serotypes in the outcome of interest (for review [16] ). For example, we have previously reported that PCV-recipients, had a 45% lower incidence of pneumonia hospitalizations in which influenza-virus was identified, and as such concluded that at least a similar proportion of the influenza-associated pneumonias among placebo-recipients was precipitated by co-infection with PCV-serotypes [14] .\n",
            " The aim of this study was to determine the burden and clinical features of WUPyV and KIPyV infections in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children hospitalized for LRTIs. Furthermore, as an exploratory analysis we used the design of a RCT of a 9-valent PCV (PCV9) to probe whether pneumococcal co-infection may contribute to hospitalization for PyV-associated pneumonia.\n",
            " We analyzed respiratory specimens collected from children who participated in RCT in South Africa as previously described [14, 17] . Briefly, 39,836 children were randomized (1:1) from 1998 to 2000 to receive 3 doses of PCV9 or placebo [17] . Hospitalbased surveillance for all-cause hospitalization was undertaken, all hospitalized children underwent HIV testing [17] . Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained from children hospitalized with LRTIs for identification of selected respiratory-viruses [14] and archived from February 2000 onward. In this study only NPAs collected from February 2000 to January 2002 from children <2 years old were analyzed. If a child had recurrent LRTI hospitalizations, only NPAs collected >28 days apart were included in the analysis. These samples had been previously investigated for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A/B, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and adenovirus using immunofluorescence and for humanmetapneumovirus (hMPV) by nested-PCR, as described [14, 15] .\n",
            " Archived NPAs were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) using the primers and probes as described [18] . We tested for WU-and KI-polyomavirus, as well as for human-bocavirus (hBoV), human-rhinovirus (hRV), and four human-coronaviruses (CoV). A comprehensive overview of the identified individual viruses has been reported separately [18] . The current analysis details the epidemiology of WUPyV and KIPyV-positive LRTIs in the study cohort. The clinical definitions used in this study have been described [14] .\n",
            " The analyses on the epidemiology of WUPyV and KIPyV in children hospitalized for LRTIs were restricted to placebo-recipients in the context of the initial trial [17] .\n",
            " Proportions were compared by Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests and continuous variables by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test. Regression analyses were performed to compare clinical features between HIV-infected and -uninfected children. Multiple regressions were controlled for age at hospitalization, detection of a virus previously-tested and year of collection. In an exploratory analysis using the concept of vaccine-probe studies [14, 19] , we explored whether there was any association between PCV9 and the risk of hospitalization for LRTIs in which WUPyV or KIPyV were detected by estimating vaccine efficacy (VE) based on the formula:\n",
            " incidence rate in the unvaccinated − incidence rate in the vaccinated incidence rate in the unvaccinated × 100\n",
            " Children were included in the per-protocol analysis if they received all the study-vaccines as per planned schedule and the LRTI event occurred >14 days after the third dose of study-vaccine. Only the first episode of viral detection was included in the VE calculation for an individual participant. p-values <0.05 were considered significant. Analyses were performed using STATA version 12.1 (College Station, TX, USA).\n",
            " A total of 1460 NPAs were analyzed by rRT-PCR, including 699 from PCV9-recipients (48.8%) and 761 (52.1%) from placeborecipients [18] .\n",
            " WUPyV was detected less frequently in HIV-infected (6.3%) compared to HIV-uninfected children (13.9%, p = 0.002) ( Table 1) . One HIV-infected and three HIV-uninfected children had at least two episodes of WUPyV-positive LRTIs more than 28 days apart. Among HIV-uninfected children, WUPyV was generally detected concurrently with other respiratory-viruses (72.7%), which was at a higher frequency compared to HIV-infected children (38.9%, p = 0.005) ( Table 1 ). The most common co-detected viruses were hRV (31.8%, n = 21), hBoV (16.7%, n = 11), RSV (12.1%, n = 8) and hMPV (10.6%, n = 7) in HIV-uninfected children; and hRV (27.8%, n = 5) and KIPyV (16.7%, n = 3) in HIV-infected children.\n",
            " By multivariate analysis of WUPyV-associated LRTIs, HIVinfected compared to HIV-uninfected children were more likely to have oxygen saturation <90%, present clinicallyas pneumonia f Other laboratory investigations assessed that were not significantly different between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children included: percentage of children presenting with C-reactive protein levels ≥40 mg/l or procalcitonin levels ≥2 ng/ml and mean white cell count.\n",
            " g Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from one HIV-infected child and in two HIV-uninfected children in whom WUPyV was detected. h Bacteria isolated from HIV-infected children in whom KIPyV was detected included: Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 2) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 1). rather than bronchiolitis. Pneumococci were isolated by blood culture in one HIV-infected child and two HIV-uninfected children with WUPyV-associated LRTI (Table 1) . HIV-infected (11.1%) compared to HIV-uninfected children (0%, p = 0.04) had a higher case fatality rate (CFR). The two HIV-infected children who died were 13 and 15 months old, both presented with pneumonia and WUPyV was the only respiratory-virus identified, neither had evidence of bacteraemia nor pulmonary tuberculosis and the one child tested for Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP) infection was negative (Table 2) . \n",
            " KIPyV was detected in 10.2% of the specimens available from HIV-infected and in 7.4% from HIV-uninfected children (p = 0.13) ( Table 1) . Recurrent KIPyV-associated LRTI episodes occurred in five HIV-infected children, including three children with two episodes each, one child with 3 episodes and one child with 5 episodes. There was a single HIV-uninfected child with two KIPyV-positive LRTIs. Identification of KIPyV was perennial, albeit uncommon during November and December 2001 (Fig. 1) . There was a lower prevalence of KIPyV detection in 2000 compared to 2001 among HIV-infected (6.6% [13/198] KIPyV was frequently detected in combination with other respiratory-viruses in both HIV-infected (75.9%) and HIVuninfected children (74.3%) ( Table 1 ). In HIV-infected the most common co-detected viruses included hRV (51.7%, n = 15), WUPyV and hMPV (10.3%, n = 3 each). In HIV-uninfected the most common viruses associated with KIPyV were hRV (31.4%, n = 11), hMPV (14.3%, n = 5) and WUPyV (11.4%, n = 4).\n",
            " HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected children with KIPyVassociated LRTIs were more likely to have oxygen saturation <90%, higher respiratory rate, longer duration of hospitalization (median [range]: 5.0 days vs. 1.0 day [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] ; p = 0.008) and were more likely to have alveolar consolidation on chest X-ray (CXR-AC) and concurrent bacteraemia (Table 1) . Pneumococci were isolated from three HIV-infected children.\n",
            " Four HIV-infected (13.8%) and two HIV-uninfected (5.7%) children in whom KIPyV was detected died during hospitalization. HIV-uninfected children with KIPyV-associated LRTI who died compared with those who survived were younger (3 vs. 12 months; p = 0.03). Both HIV-uninfected children, aged 3 months, presented with pneumonia, had co-infections with other viruses and one child (who was malnourished) also had PCP infection (Table 2) . Of the four HIV-infected children who died, KIPyV was the only respiratory-virus identified in two of them although at least one was co-infected with PCP. Overall, five of the six children who died had indirect markers of bacterial infection, including three HIV-infected with raised C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels (two of whom also had Escherichia coli bacteraemia) and the other two (one HIV-infected and one HIV-uninfected) with CXR-AC ( Table 2) .\n",
            " As an exploratory analysis the effect of PCV9-vaccination on the incidence of polyomavirus-associated pneumonia hospitalizations was evaluated. In fully vaccinated HIV-uninfected children, the incidence of WUPyV-positive clinical pneumonia hospitalizations was 48.5% (95% CI: 9.1, 70.8) lower in children who received PCV9 compared to placebo-recipients (Table 3) . A similar VE pointestimate was observed in cases restricted to episodes in which WUPyV was the sole detected virus (45.4%, 95% CI: −47.6, 79.8).\n",
            " There were also reductions in the incidence of hospitalization for KIPyV-associated clinical pneumonia in PCV9-recipients compared to placebo-recipients overall (51.3%, 95% CI: 14.5, 72.3) and specific in HIV-uninfected children (80.0%, 95% CI: 41.4, 93.2). Similar reductions were observed when KIPyV was the only identified virus (Table 3) .\n",
            " No differences in incidence were observed between PCV9-and placebo-recipients in hospitalizations for WUPyV-or KI-associated clinical pneumonia in HIV-infected children and in hospitalizations for WUPyV-or KIPyV-associated bronchiolitis.\n",
            " To our knowledge, this is the most detailed report on the prevalence and clinical features of LRTIs where polyomaviruses were detected in HIV-infected and -uninfected children. Among hospitalized HIV-infected children, WUPyV was detected in 6% of the cases and KIPyV in 10%. In HIV-uninfected children the prevalence of WUPyV was 14% and of KIPyV was 7%. In HIV-infected children 11-14% of the cases positive for at least one polyomavirus were fatal and in 67% (4 cases in total) of these WUPyV or KIPyV were identified as single-detections. Our study also established a possible interaction between polyomaviruses and pneumococcus in HIV-uninfected children, although this may have been masked in HIV-infected children in whom PCV9-vaccination was demonstrated to be less efficacious against pneumonia [17] .\n",
            " WUPyV was detected in 9% of respiratory samples from children presenting with upper or LRTI in Germany, 7% in South Korea and South Africa and 6% in Thailand; KIPyV has been identified in 1-6% of children presenting with respiratory-tract infections [12, 13, [20] [21] [22] . Another study from South Africa reported that 57% of 21 children with LRTIs with WUPyV and 33% of 3 with KIPyV were HIV-infected, however, the HIV-status was unknown in 50% of the cases [12] . In that same study, both polyomaviruses were Table 3 Differences in incidence of WUPyV and KIPyV-associated lower respiratory tract infections between fully-immunized children who received 9-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine and placebo recipients; per-protocol analysis. absent among 50 healthy immunocompetent controls [12] . The role of WU/KIPyV as more serious pathogens in immunocompromised individuals is uncertain. Higher viral loads of PyV were documented in lymphoid tissues and in the brains of HIV-infected adults compared to those from immunocompetent individuals [23, 24] . Similarly higher KIPyV viral loads were found in respiratory-tract specimens from haematology/oncology paediatric patients with respiratory infections, however, whether the viral loads correlated with disease severity was not established [13] . These observations suggest that there may be more viral replication and/or that polyomaviruses might reactivate in immunosuppressed individuals, implying that T-cell impairment might be a factor in facilitating polyomavirus replication. Norja et al. found that WU/KIPyV detection on respiratory samples occurred predominantly in two groups of subjects: immunocompetent <2 years of age with LRTIs (7%) in whom there was a high frequency of co-infection (75%), and among older, generally immunocompromised individuals without respiratory illness (11%) or with mild upper respiratory-tract infections (7%) [7] . Although our study was not designed to establish whether polyomavirus infections caused more severe disease in HIV-infected children, among hospitalized children in whom polyomaviruses were detected HIV-infected were more likely to present with pneumonia rather than bronchiolitis, had a longer duration of hospitalization and higher CFR compared to HIV-uninfected children. Similar observations have been detected between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children for other viruses [18] , and consequently may not necessarily infer causality for polyomaviruses precipitate more severe illness in HIV-infected children. The increased morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected children could have been related to other co-morbidities such as bacterial or other non-viral co-infections. In the absence of sensitive tools for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia, as well as lack of investigating for other non-viral causes of pneumonia, our study is unable to conclude the actual role of polyomaviruses to more severe disease in HIV-infected children. Nonetheless, the higher CFR, as well as that four fatal cases with polyomavirus as the sole respiratory-virus detected were all HIV-infected children suggest a possible association of polyomavirus causing severe disease in HIV-infected. Furthermore, five HIV-infected children had recurrent KIPyV-positive LRTIs compared to only one HIV-uninfected child. This could have been due to extended viral shedding, viral reactivation or reinfection. A study from Germany detected KIPyV DNA in the respiratory-tract of an immunocompromised child for 7 months and hypothesized that a KIPyV infection during childhood could result in latency of the virus in normal individuals, however, an immune impairment could result in viral reactivation [25] . In 2001 the detection rate of KIPyV in HIV-infected children was higher than in 2000 this may be because of the older cohort in 2001, hence possibly different risk of infection, or differences in year-to-year epidemics.\n",
            " The concept of a vaccine-probe analysis was initially used in attributing the contribution of Haemophilus influenza-type b in the aetiology of radiological-confirmed pneumonia, as well as subsequently in PCV trials [14, 16, 19] . We have used the same approach in probing the likelihood of co-infection by PCV9-serotypes in children hospitalized for pneumonia associated with influenza virus, PIV and hMPV [14, 15] ; and we demonstrated that 44-58% of children hospitalized for pneumonia-associated with these viruses were likely to have pneumococcus co-infection [14, 15] . Using this type of analysis, our study suggests that co-infections with PCV9serotypes contribute to hospitalizations for clinical pneumonia in which WU/KIPyV were identified. The imputed rate of coinfection of pneumococci in children with polyomaviruses-positive pneumonia from our study provides a conservative estimate of this possible interaction as only 9 serotypes were included in the vaccine and VE even against vaccine-serotypes pneumococcal pneumonia was not 100%. The high VE estimate for KIPyV-positive disease needs to be contextualized within the wide uncertainty bounds of this estimate. The suggested interaction between polyomaviruses and pneumococcus warrants further study.\n",
            " High co-infection rates with other respiratory-viruses were found for WUPyV and KIPyV which are similar to previous reports [6, 13, 20] . In the absence of a control group of children without LRTIs a definitive causal relationship between polyomavirus detection and disease could not be inferred and this constitutes a limitation of our study. Another limitation of our study is that we relied on NPAs, where identification of an organism does not necessarily imply infection. Also in our study the HIV-infected children were not treated with anti-retroviral treatment (ART), which may have contributed to their clinical course and may differ to HIV-infected children treated with ART.\n",
            " Determining the aetiology of pneumonia remains a challenge, especially in children and the pathogenic potential of some of the newly-described respiratory-viruses is difficult to address in the context of multiple infections and without specific symptoms. Although polyomaviruses were frequently detected in children hospitalized for LRTIs in our study, further studies which include autopsy samples from fatal LRTI cases, lung aspirate ant-mortem and also enrolment of healthy controls [26] , are required to clarify the role of polyomaviruses in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\n",

            "Title: Modeling and analysis of epidemic spreading on community networks with heterogeneity\n",
            "Body Text: With the development of network science, many common characteristics of real networks have been revealed, where one of the important characteristics is that a wide range of biological and social systems contains community structure [5, 9, 15, 17, [24] [25] [26] . Different individuals may form a community because of the same attributes, such as interest, age, profession and so on. As the large-scale outbreaks of epidemic diseases have occurred many times in different regions and different races in history, it can be said that the history of human history is a history of the struggle against different epidemic diseases. And with the progress of science and technology, the convenient transportation has also promoted the spread of the epidemic diseases to a great extent, for community links. They found that the existence of community makes the degree distribution get broader, and the epidemic threshold decreases with the increase of community strength (p/q) [11] . Huang and Li studied the SI dynamics on scale-free network with community structure, they found that the community structure makes the growth of the infection slow and the epidemic prevalence reduce [7] . Salathé and Jones investigated the epidemic spread in empirical and artificial networks with community structure, and got the similar conclusion: the community structure has inhibiting effect on epidemic spreading, and the peak value of epidemic prevalence decreases with the increase of community strength. Moreover, they found that immunizing bridge nodes is more effective than simply immunizing highly connected nodes in networks with strong community structure [20] . To understand the influences of community structure and clustering coefficient on SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) dynamical processes, Wu and Liu presented a network model with adjustable clustering coefficient and adjustable community strength, and found that for a fixed community strength, the efficiency of epidemic spreading will decrease with increase of the clustering coefficient [27] . Chu et al. investigated the epidemic spreading on weighted scale-free networks with community structure, and found that compared to the internal weighting exponent, the external weighting exponent has higher impact on slowing the epidemic spreading [3] . On this basis, Min et al. further studied the spread of disease on weighted scale-free community network with two mixing styles [13] : a dense-weak style and a sparse-strong style. In [2] , the authors studied the epidemic dynamics on a network with overlapping community structure and found that the epidemic prevalence increases with the increase of overlapping region. Some scholars constructed a random network composed of a sparse community and a dense community, and they studied the phenomenon that the disease persists throughout the dense community, while the outbreak and extinction states occur periodically in the sparse community [18] . Shao et al. studied the epidemic dynamics in a small-world community structure network with consideration of a traffic-driven SIS epidemic model [21] , and found that the community structure can accelerate the epidemic spreading in the traffic-driven model. Stegehuis et al. studied two random network models that create a network with similar community structure [4] , and found that the community structure can both enforce as well as inhibit diffusion processes, and the exact internal structures of communities barely influence the behavior of spreading processes. Based on the SI (susceptible-infected) epidemic model, Shu et al. numerically studied how weak ties (connect pairs of nodes belonging to different communities) influence epidemic dynamics [23] . Some scholars studied the SEAIR (susceptibleexposed-asymptomatically infected-symptomatically infectedrecovered) [32] and the stochastic SIR [31] epidemic model on scale-free networks with community structure. Bonaccorsi et al. analyzed a continuous-time SIS model on a community structure network in which individuals that belong to different communities have different infecting probabilities [1] . Ren et al. investigated SIS epidemic spreading processes on a time-varying community structure network [19] . Xia et al. presented a new epidemic SIS model to investigate the spreading behavior on community structure networks with dynamical topology. They found that the epidemic threshold is only related with the population density within the community, and the long-range motion will make the original disease-free community become the endemic state [28] .\n",
            " In most existing community network models, the researchers often ignored the heterogeneity among different communities. However, in the real social networks, the physical contacts among individuals in some communities are more closer than in other communities, which reflects the heterogeneity among communities. For example, in real social networks, young students community interact with each other more frequently than elderly people community. Furthermore, studies have suggested that heterogeneity in contact patterns among individuals in heterogeneity communities has an important effect on the epidemic spreading [10] . In addition, many scholars are concerned about finding ways to suppress the spread of the virus, such as looking for more effective immune strategies and raising awareness of the individuals. While some scholars hope to find the source of epidemic spreading and control the epidemic spreading in the early stage of epidemic spreading [6, 8, 22, 33] . When there exists heterogeneity among the communities in the network, we are curious about whether the difference in the location of the source of infection will affect the spread of the virus, and want to study the transmission rule of epidemic on the community structure network with heterogeneity among communities, which is helpful for us to find an effective control strategy for epidemic spreading.\n",
            " Mathematical modeling of the dynamics of infectious diseases, as a quantitative research method, has been widely used in the field of the epidemic spreading. In this paper, we firstly construct a new community structure network model with adjustable heterogeneity among communities. Then we establish a novel epidemic spreading model based on this network model and calculate the epidemic threshold. And we analyze the impacts of heterogeneity among different communities and modularity coefficient on epidemic spreading either. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce in detail our network model, and the network characteristics are discussed either. In Section 3, we define the epidemic model and introduce the mean field equations. Then we give some numerical and simulations which support the theoretical analysis in Section 4. Finally, this paper ends with concluding remarks in Section 5.\n",
            " The possible mechanisms of constructing a community structure network have been revealed by many models [2] [3] [4] 7, 11, 13, [18] [19] [20] [21] 27, 28] , and these network models also take into account different actual features of the real networks, like clustering coefficient [27] and edge weight [3, 13] . Most of the models ignore the heterogeneity among communities, and how it affects the spread of epidemic is a practical and meaningful problem. In [10] , by observing the real populations in the populated city Hong Kong, the researchers find out that the heterogeneity of contact patterns of individuals within and between different age groups is an important impacting factor in the transmission of infectious diseases, so they take into account the age structure of a population and the different contact patterns among individuals in different age groups and propose an age-structured model. When the groups of different ages mentioned in Ref. [10] are regarded as different communities, the whole population in the city can be viewed as a community structure network with heterogeneity. In this section, we construct a new community structure network model with heterogeneity among communities based on random network, in which the average degree of each community may be different.\n",
            " Assuming that there are m different communities, each community has n i ( i = 1, 2, . . . , m) individuals. The generating algorithm of the new community network with heterogeneity can be described as follows:\n",
            " (1) Each node is assigned to a single community in accordance with the communities' size.\n",
            " (2) At each time step, each pair of unconnected nodes in i-th community can be connected with probability p in i . It should be noted that the inter-community connection probability of each community (p in i ) may be different. (3) At each time step, randomly chose two nodes which are not neighbors and belong to different communities, then connect them with probability p ex to create an inter-community link where p ex ≪ min(p in i ) , which makes the community network has a strong community strength.\n",
            " Through the above process, a community network with heterogeneity can be generated, in which the heterogeneity among communities is manifested in the difference of the average degree of each community ⟨k i ⟩. We can get community networks with different heterogeneity by adjusting p in i . When given a set of different networks, to measure the strength of heterogeneity among communities for each network, we set a heterogeneity strength function H and its expression is:\n",
            " Assume that these networks all have m communities. In Eq. (1), the numerator D (⟨k i ⟩) denotes the variance of the communities' average degree of a network, it can be expressed as:\n",
            " where the sub item ⟨k⟩ in Eq. Suppose that the total number of edges is E, we obtain:\n",
            " As an important measurement for the community strength of community networks, modularity coefficient [15] is defined as follows :\n",
            " where e ij denotes the proportion of edges between community i and j in the entire network. So e ii and ∑ j e ij can be described as follows:\n",
            " where E represents the total edge number, which is the same as shown in Eq. (3). Thus, the modularity coefficient of our model is:\n",
            " Therefore, from Eqs. (3) and (7), we can get the relationship between the modularity coefficient Q and other parameters, such as n i , ⟨k i ⟩ , p in i and p ex . The values of p in i and p ex can be adjusted to get community structure networks with given modularity Q, n i and ⟨k i ⟩ .\n",
            " The existence of heterogeneity among communities in the network may lead to a novel phenomenon on the epidemic spreading. So in this section, different from the previous mathematical model, we will describe the spreading process by a novel SIR (susceptibleinfected-recovered) mathematical model, which is based on each community and considers both of the inter-and intra-community epidemiological processes of all nodes in a community.\n",
            " In the initial stage of epidemic transmission, there are only a small number of infected individuals in the network, and the rest of them are susceptible individuals. At each time step, an susceptible individual can be infected by one of its infected neighbors with probability λ , and an infected individual can be recovered with probability γ . The infection process contains two parts for each community in general: intra-community infection and intercommunity infection. Let ⟨k i ⟩ denote the average degree of intra-community within communities i , and ⟨ k ij ⟩ denote that of inter-community between community i and j . As p in i and p ex are the inner-community and inter-community connection rates, thus\n",
            " can be expressed as follows:\n",
            " and\n",
            " Let parameters S, I and R respectively represent the density of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals in the entire network. Similarly, S i , I i and R i represent the proportion of healthy, infected and recovered individuals of the i-th community. Then the new epidemic model for each community can be constructed as:\n",
            " As the communities of the network have different average degrees, each community has its own epidemic threshold which is called community threshold in this paper. The following question naturally arises. What is the relation between community thresholds and entire network threshold? In the following, we will derive community thresholds and entire network threshold.\n",
            " Let n S i and n I i denote the numbers of susceptible and infected individuals within i-th community, so S i and I i in Eq. (10) \n",
            " Because of the complex structure of community network, theoretical analysis of the epidemic threshold is very difficult. For simplicity, we assume that each community has the same size n, namely, n i = n (i = 1, 2, . . . , m). We substitute Eqs. (8) and (9) into Eq. (10), then the simplified equations are as follows:\n",
            " Combining\n",
            " and Eq. (11), we can accurately estimate the threshold. For a community network, if the modularity coefficient Q is large enough, the impact of spread through the inter-community edges on the epidemic prevalence within a community almost can be ignored. Thus, we can approximately estimate the epidemic threshold of a community. The calculation process is as follows. Firstly, the first and third equations in Eq. (11) can be approximated:\n",
            " where the initial condition S i (0) ≈ 1/m . From Eq. (12), we can eliminate the term of I i (t) , namely,\n",
            " Then compute the integral:\n",
            " Thus, we get\n",
            " there will be no infected nodes in the community network, namely, S i (∞) + R i (∞) = 1/m . Thus, we get:\n",
            " where R i (∞) = 0 is a trivial solution of Eq. (15) , and this equation has other nonzero solutions when d\n",
            " It is possible that part/one of the communities in the network are/is endemic, while the epidemic do not erupt throughout the network. So the theoretical threshold of the entire network λ c is between the maximum and the minimum of the community thresholds.\n",
            " In this section, to discuss the influence of various factors on the dynamics of epidemic spreading, we give a set of simulations on different kinds of community networks with heterogeneity among communities and examine how the outbreak of epidemic is affected by both the heterogeneity among communities and modularity coefficient. In addition, we compare the effects of the infectious source locations on epidemic spreading either. In the following simulations, there is a small fraction of infected nodes in one of the communities initially, while the remaining individuals of the entire network are susceptible.\n",
            " Next, we make simulations and comparisons based on the homogeneous community structure network with heterogeneity among communities. It is well known that, in real networks, the outbreak of each epidemic is caused by a small number of infected individuals of a local area in the network. Since there are differences among communities, did the location of the initial infection node/nodes has effect on the epidemic spreading? To obtain a definitive answer, we do some simulations on three community structure networks, where each network is constructed based on ER random network model and has three communities with different heterogeneity. Figs. 1-3 show the time evolution curves of epidemic size of three different networks, where the average degrees of three networks are the same, but with different average degrees in each the seed node locations, we assume that the network models have the same average degree of the entire network ( ⟨k⟩ = 20 ) and the community sizes are n 1 = n 2 = n 3 = 500 . We find that, for each network, the location of the infection source affects only the propagation velocity rather than the epidemic prevalence. We also observe that the time duration to reach the steady state is inversely proportional to the heterogeneity among communities. In each simulation, an initial infected node is randomly chosen from a specified community. And for each network, 5000 simulations are taken with a randomly chosen seed node initially. The other simulation parameters are: the infection rate λ = 0.1 and the modularity coefficient Q = 0.6. Fig. 4 shows the effects of heterogeneity among communities on epidemic threshold and prevalence. In the simulations, there are three communities within the network and the communities sizes are n 1 = n 2 = n 3 = 500. We keep the degree of entire network to be constant at ⟨k⟩ = 20 . The graph contains three sets of data, which compare the thresholds and prevalence of epidemic of these community networks. The lines with red dots, black circle and blue asterisk respectively correspond to the networks with intra-community degrees ⟨k i ⟩ = {10, 20, 30} , ⟨k i ⟩ = {15, 20, 25} and ⟨k i ⟩ = {20, 20, 20} . From Fig. 4 , we find that the increase of heterogeneity among communities makes the infectious diseases easier to break out, namely the heterogeneity among communities has negative relation with the epidemic threshold. And the epidemic prevalence of a network with greater heterogeneity among communities is larger than others, whereas the converse situation holds when the infection rate is much greater than the epidemic threshold.\n",
            " In Fig. 5 , we study the effect of modularity coefficient Q on the epidemic threshold λ c in three networks with different modularity coefficients (equal to 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 respectively). In the simulations, there are three communities within each network and the average degrees of three communities are all ⟨k i ⟩ = {15, 20, 25} , i = 1, 2, 3 . The degrees of these networks are all ⟨k⟩ = 20 and the communities sizes are n 1 = n 2 = n 3 = 500. It is found that the epidemic threshold decreases with the increase of the modularity coefficient of the network, and the epidemic size of the network with higher modularity coefficient is larger around the epidemic threshold, while the inverse situation occurs when the infection rate is far greater than the threshold. It is necessary to explain that although the threshold values obtained through simulations cannot completely correspond to the threshold deduced theoretically, the relationship between the parameters of the network (especially the heterogeneity among communities H and the modularity coefficient Q ) and the propagation threshold is in accordance with the theoretical deduction. As the existence of heterogeneity among communities, the network models with same average degree of the entire network may show different modularity coefficients, and we cannot be sure whether the results of above simulations are only affected by the heterogeneity. So, we firstly investigate the relationship between heterogeneity and modularity of the community networks that was used before. In the following simulations, there are three communities in each network, and the community sizes are the same. Let the average degree of all networks be ⟨k⟩ = 20. From Eq. (7), we can get the parameters (inter-and intra-community linking rate) that were used to construct the network model with given network configurations. As shown in Fig. 6 , the vertical and horizontal axes in the graph stand for heterogeneity H (see Section 2) and modularity Q respectively. The curve is obtained with heterogeneity. So we can conclude that the results of above simulations in Figs. 1-5 are only affected by the heterogeneity.\n",
            " The above simulations aim at the single source of infection. However, in real life people often move and contact to make virus appear in many regions at the same time, leading to multiple sources of infection. In the following, we will do some simulations on how the process of epidemic spreading is affected when multiple sources of infection are distributed among different communities in the community structure network with heterogeneity. In Figs. 7-9, we show the time evolution curves of epidemic size of three different networks, where the average degrees of three networks are the same, but with different average degrees in each community. We assume there are two sources of infection in the network, and that these two seed nodes are located in two communities. The parameters of the three networks used in the simulations are consistent with the previous single source of infection. The other simulation parameters are: the infection rate λ = 0.05 and the modularity coefficient Q = 0.6. For each network, 2000 simulations are taken with two randomly chosen seed nodes initially.\n",
            " From Figs. 7-9, we find that the speed and prevalence of the epidemic spreading change with the locations of the sources of infection. Looking at each figure, we can see that the propagation speed is the fastest and the ultimate prevalence of epidemic spreading is the largest when two seed nodes are located in the two communities with largest average degree, and the opposite situation appears when the two seed nodes are located in the two communities with minimal average degree. And the larger the heterogeneity among communities, the greater the difference between curves. It should be noted that the difference between the three curves is not so large, which means that the locations of multiple sources of infection have little influence on the prevalence of epidemic spreading. Comparing these three figures, we find that the epidemic prevalence decreases with the increase of the heterogeneity among communities.\n",
            " As the small world network is a kind of homogeneous network, the WS small world community structure network also belongs to the homogeneous networks homogeneous community networks, namely, the epidemic spreading mathematical model proposed before is still applicable to it. What is to be explained here is that we also do the same simulations in the WS small world community structure networks, and the simulation results are very similar to those obtained based on the ER random community structure networks. Therefore, we will no longer show these simulation curves here. In the last part of this section, we will compare and analyze how the epidemic spreading process is influenced by the topology of three kinds of community structure networks (the community networks respectively constructed based on the ER random network, the WS small world network and the BA scalefree network).\n",
            " It is difficult to build an epidemic dynamic model based on the heterogeneous community networks with heterogeneity among communities. In the third section, some conclusions are obtained for homogeneous community network by analyzing the proposed epidemic dynamics model and verified by some Monte Carlo simulations. Next, we construct a heterogeneous community network model considering the heterogeneity among communities, and do Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the dynamics of epidemic spreading. In the following simulations, each network contains three communities, and the community sizes are n 1 = n 2 = 0.1 and the modularity coefficient Q = 0.6 . In order to find out the impact of the location of infection source on the epidemic spreading process, we randomly chose an initial infected node from a specified community in each simulation. From these three figures, we find that the location of the infection source only affects the propagation velocity. The average degrees for three communities are shown in each figure. From Fig. 10 to Fig. 12 , the heterogeneity among communities decreases, while the corresponding epidemic prevalence increases. This is because with the increase of the heterogeneity among communities, the links between nodes become closer in some communities, while the edges of the nodes in other communities are thinning which is analogous to the situation that deleting the inner edges of most communities and adding edges only in a small number of communities, so the epidemic will be suppressed when the virus spreads to the sparse community. Fig. 13 shows the curves of epidemic threshold for each community in a heterogeneous community networks with heterogeneity among communities where the average degrees for three communities are ⟨k i ⟩ = {14, 26, 20} , i = 1, 2, 3, and the community coefficient Q = 0.6. Communities with larger average degree of intra-community have smaller epidemic threshold. From Fig. 14 , we can get the global epidemic threshold, and its value indeed between the maximum and the minimum of the communities' thresholds. Fig. 14 shows the curves of epidemic thresholds for three networks with different heterogeneity. And Fig. 15 shows the curves , we find that the heterogeneity among communities has negative relation with the epidemic threshold, namely, the infectious diseases become easier to break out with the increase of heterogeneity among communities. And the epidemic prevalence of a network with greater heterogeneity among communities is larger than others, whereas the converse situation holds when the infection rate is much greater than the epidemic threshold. From Fig. 15 , we find that the epidemic threshold decreases with the increase of the modularity coefficient of the network, and the epidemic size of the network with higher modularity coefficient is larger around the epidemic threshold, while the inverse situation occurs when the infection rate is far greater than the threshold. These conclusions are consistent with those obtained from homogeneous community networks with heterogeneity among communities.\n",
            " The networks in real life is more complex, for example, the internal topology of some groups in the network tends to the scalefree network, and some groups are closer to the small world or random networks, that is, several mixing style groups form a large network, we called it the mixing style community network. It is another kind of community network with heterogeneity among communities, which is more consistent with the actual network. However, its mathematical epidemic spreading dynamics model is more difficult to build. Next, we construct the mixing style community structure network based on scale-free network and random network, and analyze the epidemiology through Monte Carlo simulations.\n",
            " We first try to see whether the location of the infection source of the mixed mode community structure network will have an impact on the propagation speed and the final transmission scale. Let the average degree in each community be the same, namely, 26, 20} , i = 1, 2, 3. From Fig. 16 , we find that, only the speed of epidemic spreading is affected by the location of the infection source.\n",
            " From Figs. 17 and 18, we find that the value of the global epidemic threshold is indeed between the maximum and the minimum of the communities thresholds. We mainly verify the formal conclusions, and more in-depth studies will be carried out later. \n",
            " Next, according to ER random network model algorithm, WS Small World Network model algorithm and BA scale-free network model algorithm, we generate three kinds of community structure networks with different community heterogeneity among communities. Using the SIR propagation dynamics model, the epidemic spreading dynamics of infectious diseases in different network topologies are analyzed and compared by simulations. The network and related network parameters in simulation are as follows. There are three communities within each network and the communities sizes are n 1 = n 2 = n 3 = 500, the node degree of the entire network ⟨k⟩ is constant at 20. The graph contains three sets of data, which compare the thresholds and prevalence of epidemic of these community networks. Let the intra-community average degree ⟨k i ⟩ respectively be 10, 20 and 30 to generate community networks with larger heterogeneity among communities, and let ⟨k i ⟩ respectively be 14, 20 and 26 to generate community networks with smaller heterogeneity among communities.\n",
            " Figs. 19 and 20 show the time evolution comparison curves of epidemic prevalence with single source of the infection in the BA scale-free community network, the ER random community network and WS small world community network, where the infection rate λ = 0.025. Here, the modularity coefficient Q is set to 0.6 for these three kinds of community networks, and For the propagation velocity of epidemic spreading, from these two figures, we can find that BA>ER>WS, which is consistent with the situation in the networks without community structure. And the peak value of the epidemic prevalence in the BA scale-free community network is obviously far greater than the other two, while the other two networks' peak values are basically the same.\n",
            " From Fig. 21 , we can find that, for these three community structure network models, the change trend of the epidemic threshold of the entire network is in order of WS>ER>BA, which is also consistent with the situation in the networks without community structure. In addition, when the infection rate is near the critical value, with the increase of transmission rate, the growth rate of epidemic prevalence of each network from large to small is BA>ER>WS, and when the rate of infection increases to a certain value, the situation reverses. Finally, the ultimate epidemic prevalence on the WS small world community network is the largest.\n",
            " To summarize, we have proposed a modified community network model considering the heterogeneity among communities, which is more close to real networks. Based on this network with heterogeneity among communities, we have presented a mathematical epidemic model for each community and studied the epidemic dynamics in this network model. It has been found that community networks with different heterogeneities but the same average degree have different epidemic thresholds, and the epidemic threshold value of the entire network is between the maximum and minimum values of communities epidemic threshold. And when there is only one seed node in the network, the location of the initial infected individuals affects only the propagation velocity rather than the epidemic prevalence, while when there are multiple sources of infection in the network, the location of the sources of infection will have some influences on both the speed and prevalence of the epidemic spreading. In addition, the epidemic threshold is inversely proportional to the heterogeneity among communities. The study results are helpful to predict epidemic spreading trend more accurately and find useful strategies for controlling disease spreading.\n"

            "Body Text: Dormancy, such as hibernation in mammals [1, 2] , diapause of insects and zooplankton [3] , as well as the soil seed banks [4, 5] , is a widespread and efficient adaptive strategy for populations under environmental fluctuation. Various types of dormancy are also a common form of stress response in bacteria including sporulation of Gram-positive bacteria [6] [7] [8] . The evolutionary stability of dormancy has been investigated under varying environments [3, 9, 10] , as well as under the environment with minimal abiotic fluctuations [3] . However, the dormant form of an organism is much more costly compared with the active form in the course of evolution, due to its inability to breed and the large energy consumption during resting egg production as is the case for many invertebrates, such as zooplankton [11, 12] .\n",
            " Hence, dormancy has become a topic of major interest in evolutionary biology: why does dormancy persist and remain a competitive evolutionary strategy? Previous studies have shown the advantage of predator dormancy when two types of predators compete for a single resource [13, 14] . This phenomenon was first experimentally discovered by [15] and subsequently analyzed by [16] . They found that large-amplitude fluctuations can be avoided by predator dormancy in the predator-prey dynamic population model, explaining the paradox of enrichment [17] [18] [19] . However, the effect of prey dormancy has not been studied: how will dormancy affect the prey, and can prey dormancy also suppress largeamplitude fluctuation?\n",
            " In order to identify the factors that determine whether prey remains active or goes into dormancy, it is necessary to quantify the competition among prey. Under the high density of predators, the conditions are harsh for prey because they have to avoid being foraged by numerous predators. Under these conditions, the ability to enter dormancy will be beneficial to the prey allowing it to reduce its consumption and breeding, as well as the probability of being discovered. In contrast, the prey will remain active to promote population growth under a low density of predators. Furthermore, dormancy is beneficial for prey (actually, for any organism) under large-amplitude environmental fluctuation, especially under harsh environmental conditions, but not in a safe, stable environment. Recently, it has been shown that environmentally destructive populations can survive by switching between \"nomadic\" and \"colonial\" forms [20] [21] [22] . Predator dormancy also allows the predator to survive in the large-amplitude fluctuation [14] . In these models, one form grows rapidly but depletes the environment (which includes prey in the case of predator and host in the case of a parasite), whereas the other one does not affect the environment but decays. Each of these strategies individually results in extinction, but combined, they can ensure the survival of the population. Therefore, these models exhibit Parrondo's paradox, an abstraction of the phenomenon of flashing Brownian ratchets [23] [24] [25] , where a winning outcome can be achieved by alternating between two losing strategies [26] [27] [28] [29] .\n",
            " Inspired by the previous analyses of the predator-prey model, we propose a population dynamic model to investigate the competition between two forms of prey with different settings under predation. The two forms of dormitive prey y 1 and y 2 are both losing strategies compared with the perennially active (PA) prey p with superior traits. Indeed, the active form of the dormitive prey y 1 has a lower growth rate than the PA prey, spending energy on dormant offspring rather than foraging, and thus loses; the dormant form y 2 is also a losing strategy due to its low growth rate and inability to grow on its own. In the game-theoretic perspective, these two strategies cannot individually compete with the PA prey. However, alternating between these two losing strategies allows the dormitive prey to gain an advantage in the competition. This result recapitulates the phenomenon of Parrondo's paradox. An additional unexpected finding is that the dormitive prey, which generally would be assumed to be more effective under harsh environmental conditions, in this model, has a higher fitness in richer environments. This outcome is determined by the high density of predators and the large-amplitude fluctuations.\n",
            " The competition between different forms of prey and the effect of dormancy\n",
            " We develop a population dynamic model to explore the competition between the two types of prey under predation (Eqs. 1, 2, and 3). The differences between the two types of prey are that (1) the PA prey p has a higher growth rate r p and (2) the dormitive prey has two forms (active form y 1 and dormant form y 2 ) which are determined by dormancy switching function μ(z) and dormancy termination rate α. In general, the prey with a higher growth rate will dominate and survive for a long time in the environment under predation. Hence, the density of the predator z is one of the vital parameters for the competition of prey. Especially, the predator density determines the dormancy switching in our model such that there is more dormant form under a higher predator density but more active form under a lower density of predators. Here, we assume that the density of the dormant form of the dormitive prey does not contribute to the density-dependent growth, and the mortality rate is a constant for the predator. In gametheoretic terms, the active form y 1 and dormant form y 2 of the dormitive prey are both losing strategies compared with the PA prey p because (1) the active form has a lower growth rate and spends extra energy to produce dormant offspring and (2) the dormant form also has a lower growth rate and cannot support population growth on its own. However, will the dormitive prey with a lower growth rate but capable of entering dormancy under harsh environmental conditions overtake the PA prey and win the competition in the environment? The detailed descriptions, the initial values, and the units of parameters and functions used in our model, which were obtained from published real-world data [11, 14, [30] [31] [32] , are given in Table 1 .\n",
            " In the first competition scenario, we assume that the active form or the dormant form of the dormitive prey competes with the PA prey individually (Fig. 1A, B) , under different initial population densities, dormancy termination rates α, and dormancy switching functions μ(z). In this case, y 2 equals 0 ( Fig. 1A) , and y 1 equals 0 ( Fig. 1B) individually. In this competition, the active form of the dormitive prey is disadvantaged compared with the PA prey and eventually goes extinct (t = 40) due to its low growth rate (Fig. 1A) , whereas the dormant form of the dormitive prey becomes extinct already in the first wave because it cannot sustain population growth on its own (Fig. 1B) . Thus, both forms are losing strategies for the dormitive prey, so that the PA prey outcompetes y under all conditions. In this competition, the interaction between the PA prey and the predator follows the Rosenzweig-MacArthur criterion [33] .\n",
            " In the next competition scenario, we assume that the dormitive prey can switch between the active and dormant forms (Fig. 1C ) due to the setting of μ(z). In this case, the PA prey is dominant at the beginning (t ∈ [0, 320]) thanks to its high growth rate r p . However, the PA prey cannot support the high density of predators. At high density, the predator will forage for a large number of the PA prey, causing its extinction, because it has no recourse to an evasive strategy (dormancy). Thus, it begins to decline after t = 200 and becomes extinct at t = 380. Then, the dormitive prey overtakes the PA prey and gradually evolves towards a steady state of coexistence with the predator. There are more active forms at lower density of the predator and more dormant forms under higher density of predators because of the setting of μ(z). The density of the active form is similar to the density of the PA prey, which is determined by the carrying capacity K. In order to examine the dynamics of different populations more closely, a cycle of the dynamic process (t ∈ [400, 450]) is enlarged (Fig. 1D) . The peaks of different populations do not occur at the same time. Specifically, the peak time of y 2 occurs between the peak times of y 1 and z. In addition, the growth rate of the dormant form of the dormitive prey around t = 420 is higher than the rate during t ∈ [410, 418], which is determined by the growth term r y ð1− pþy 1 K Þð 1−μðzÞÞy 1 . During t ∈ [410, 418], the growth of the dor- Table 1 The descriptions, values, and units of parameters and functions used in the model (from recent real-world data [11, 14, [30] [31] [32] mant form is mainly due to the increasing density of the active form of the dormitive prey, causing the increase of ð 1− pþy 1 K Þy 1 , under the logistic growth model. However, after t = 418, the density of the active form begins to drop and the density of the predator begins to increase, and therefore, the growth rate of the dormant form is higher than before because of the rapid increase in 1 − μ(z) (Eq. 3). After t = 420, the growth rate is slower than the foraging rate, so the dormant form of the dormitive prey declines and the predator reaches its peak.\n",
            " Impact of the carrying capacity on the outcome of the competition As the carrying capacity K increases, there will be more prey, causing a higher density of predators. However, our previous results show that the PA prey cannot support the high density of the predator and thus becomes extinct. Hence, the impact of the carrying capacity on the competition between the two types of prey should be studied. Compared with K = 11 (Fig. 1C) , the dormitive prey will take advantage earlier at K = 13 ( Fig. 2A) . The PA prey cannot reach its peak (near carrying capacity) under these conditions and will begin to decline at a point where it still has an apparent potential to rise. This is the case because the current density of prey already results in high predator density such that the prey cannot reach the environmental capacity due to the high rate of predation. However, the predator grows faster than before thanks to the availability of adequate resources, so the PA prey will become extinct quickly because of the lack of an evasive strategy. The first time when the peak density of the active form of the dormitive prey is higher than the peak density of the PA prey is called the reversal time T w . The reversal time T w is 195.1 in this case ( Fig. 2A) , that is, reversal occurs earlier than it does at K = 11. When K continues to rise to 20 (Fig. 2B) , the reversal time further shortens, to T w = 89.2. In addition, the peak density of the active form of the dormitive prey is also higher than for the previous conditions and comes close to the carrying capacity. In contrast, when K decreases to 9 (Fig. 2C) , the PA prey is at an advantage because the density of the predator is lower than it is at larger K. This allows the PA prey to grow in the environment and avoid extinction. The peak density of the PA prey is also close to K = 9, the same as discussed before. At a high predator density, the PA prey will be extensively foraged and will eventually go extinct. In contrast, the dormitive prey can enter dormancy to survive at a high density of the predator, which is a competitive survival strategy. Hence, the dormant form is advantageous to the prey under population fluctuation in the apparent competition [34] . The reversal time T w changes rapidly when the carrying capacity K is low but stays nearly constant at high K (Fig. 2D) .\n",
            " We further explored the parameter space of the model to determine how the dormitive prey gains advantage under different conditions. The outcomes were evaluated by the highest density of each competitor during t ∈ [2800, 3000] (stable competition). Due to the impracticality of all-vs-all parameter comparison, the parameters were analyzed in pairs as follows. Table 1 unless stated otherwise. The initial population density is [2, 2, 0, 1]. A Carrying capacity K equals 13. B Carrying capacity K equals 20, causing higher density of each population and shorter reversal time T w compared to the case that K equals 13. C Carrying capacity K equals 9, the PA prey wins the competition. D The relationship between the reversal time T w and carrying capacity K. Fig. 3 The parameter space of population traits that determines which type of prey can achieve a higher abundance, recapitulating the phenomenon of Parrondo's paradox. The parameter values are from Table 1 unless stated otherwise. A, B Joint impact of carrying capacity K, dormancy termination rate α, and predator death rate d z on prey density when two types of prey are under predation. C, D Joint impact of parameters in the dormancy switching function μ(z) on prey density when two types of prey are under predation, including the lower bound χ, range φ, switching threshold η, and width σ. E, F The relationships between the predator and two types of prey, including the growth efficiencies k q and foraging efficiencies c q , are compared The carrying capacity K was first compared with the dormancy termination rate α (Fig. 3A) . When K is low, the PA prey reaches a higher abundance than the active form of the dormitive prey, no matter how α changes. This is because there are not enough predators to consume resources (prey) under low K, thus avoiding the extinction of the PA prey. However, as K increases, a large number of predators will forage for the PA prey, leading to its extinction. In this case, the active form of the dormitive prey gains advantage under medium values of α, because both the high and low α only allow a single form of dormitive prey to exist, which are losing strategies compared with the PA prey (Fig. 1A, B) . The carrying capacity K is then compared with the predator death rate d z (Fig. 3B) . With the increase of K, the density of both types of prey will increase, the same as the result in Fig. 3A . At low K, only small values of d z allow the active form of the dormitive prey to win because only the dormitive prey can survive under the high density of predators in this case. There will be more prey in the environment with higher K, leading to many predators; thus, the PA prey can only win under higher values of d z (fewer predators) as shown above. Hence, there is only a narrow range of d z for the PA prey to dominate in the environment under high K, but a wide range of d z under low K.\n",
            " Four parameters in the dormancy switching function μ(z) were then compared because of the importance of switching for the dormitive prey. The lower bound χ and range φ determine how many preys remain active and how many go dormant (Fig. 3C) . The values of χ and φ obey the condition 0 ≤ χ ≤ χ + φ ≤ 1, which means that the value of the dormancy switching function should be between 0 and 1. We find that the active form of the dormitive prey can only gain advantage when χ is relatively low (χ ≤ 0.6) and χ + φ is close to 1. χ cannot be too large because the prey needs a certain amount of active form to provide the growth capacity in all cases; otherwise, the dormitive prey will go extinct. The reason why χ + φ ≈ 1 is to ensure full reproduction under safe conditions, so that the dormitive prey can survive under environmental fluctuations. In the comparison of switching threshold η and width σ in μ(z) (Fig. 3D) , the dormitive prey can reach a higher abundance than the PA prey with low σ because of the sharp switching. The sharp switching between the active and dormant form results in a strong fitness to the environment, allowing the disadvantaged prey to win in the competition.\n",
            " The relationships between the predator and two types of prey are further studied. The comparison between the predator growth efficiencies from the active form k p ; k y 1 and the efficiency from the dormant form k y 2 (Fig. 3E) shows that k y 2 does not affect the result of the competition. Higher k p and k y 1 will cause more predators in the environment, resulting in the winning outcome of the active form of the dormitive prey (similar results in Fig. 3B) . We assume the foraging efficiencies c y 2 ≤c p and c y 2 ≤ c y 1 in Fig. 3F because the dormant form is less likely to be found and thus avoids predation. There will be more predators under higher c p and c y 1 , and thus, it can be concluded that the dormitive prey will win in this case (same reason as in Fig. 3B ).\n",
            " Analysis of the present model shows that the dormitive prey can outcompete the PA prey with superior traits by switching between the active and dormant forms. The counterintuitive results obtained here are that (1) the dormitive prey with lower growth rate and extra energy loss can overtake the PA prey and win the competition and (2) prey dormancy is advantageous in rich environments (high carrying capacity), whereas intuitively, it could be expected to gain advantage in poor environments. These surprising outcomes of the competition can be explained through Parrondo's paradox: alternation of two losing strategies can result in a winning strategy. In this model, both the active form and the dormant form of the dormitive prey are individually disadvantaged in the competition against the PA prey because (1) the active form of the dormitive prey has a lower growth rate and spends extra energy to produce dormant offspring, and (2) the dormant form also has a lower growth rate and cannot support population growth on its own (Fig. 1A, B) . However, a winning outcome for the dormitive prey can be achieved by alternating between the active form and the dormant form (Fig.  1C ). This result can be explained by Parrondo's paradox [35] [36] [37] . Parrondo's paradox also might be applicable to other biological competitions. For example, bacteriophages can switch between active reproduction (hostdestroying lytic phase) and dormancy (lysogenic phase) depending on the state of the external environment [38] , and the dormancy of phages (lysogeny) can be considered an adaptation to host population oscillations.\n",
            " Under a high carrying capacity, a high density of prey is reached by logistic growth [39] , thereby supporting a high density of predators. However, the high density of predators will lead to the extinction of the PA prey because the latter has no recourse to dormancy as an evasive strategy ( Fig. 2A, B) . Hence, the dormitive prey has higher fitness under higher carrying capacity (higher density of predators). Furthermore, the higher the carrying capacity, the sooner (smaller value of the reversal time T w ) the dormitive prey will gain advantage and overtake (Fig. 2D ) because predators will grow faster and forage more PA prey. In contrast, the PA prey will gain advantage under the low peak density of predators (Fig.  2C ) because it can support the predator population at this low density. Therefore, the density of predators (determined by the carrying capacity in our model) is the key factor that determines the outcome of the competition between the two types of prey [34, 40] . This allows us to interpret the second counterintuitive result: prey dormancy is advantageous in richer environments. The resource-rich environment not only increases the density of the prey, but also causes the large-amplitude population (predator-prey) cycles and high density of predators due to the prey oversupply, followed by over-predation [15, 17] . The dormant form of prey can survive under the high density of predators in the population cycles to come back subsequently, whereas the PA prey goes extinct in the cycles. Furthermore, no matter which prey has the advantage in the competition, the peak density of prey is higher in a richer environment, approaching the carrying capacity and causing large amplitude cycles, which is beneficial to the dormitive prey.\n",
            " The large-amplitude population cycles have been explored in diverse real-world cases, such as the relationship between Daphnia and plankton [15, 41] , Arctic lemmings and weasels [42] , parasites and mountain hares [43] , and intraspecific competition of Antarctic krill [44] . These results show the effect of over-predation and potential applications of Parrondo's paradox [45, 46] . The large-amplitude fluctuations are usually accompanied by the extinction of populations [16, 17] , but dormancy allows the prey to survive the fluctuation, with a subsequent comeback. Thus, our key finding is that the dormitive prey can gain advantage and overtake in the competition under large-amplitude fluctuations. Indeed, prey dormancy has been observed in a variety of predator-prey systems including bacteria (Myxococcus as predator and Bacillus as prey) [47] [48] [49] ; arthropods-spider mites [50, 51] ; and small rodents-dormice [52, 53] .\n",
            " An obvious limitation of this work is that, because of the wide variation of the parameters of predator and prey populations, the dynamics derived from the real-world data [11, 14, [30] [31] [32] might substantially differ from those predicted by the model. Nevertheless, we explored in detail the impact of multiple parameter combinations on the competition outcome. In particular, this analysis shows that the parameter values that cause a higher density of predators, such as lower death rate, higher predator growth efficiencies, and higher foraging efficiencies, will lead to the extinction of the PA prey. In addition, the range of dormancy termination rates ensuring the winning outcome for the dormitive prey is determined by the carrying capacity, which can also affect the density of predators. The parameters in the threshold-induced dormancy function also need to be in a suitable range for the dormitive prey to win the competition.\n",
            " The analysis of the present model indicates that the counterintuitive winning outcome for the dormitive prey is underlain by the game-theoretic Parrondo's paradox. In the large-amplitude fluctuation, dormancy can help the dormitive prey to outcompete the PA prey with superior traits and even cause the extinction of the PA prey. Parrondo's paradox is likely to be widely applicable to other biological competitions with large-amplitude fluctuations.\n",
            " In the dynamic population model, we introduce an additional prey population (y) to the existing predator-prey model, adapted from the Lotka-Volterra-derived model of Rosenzweig and MacArthur [33, 54, 55] . In detail, two prey populations (p, y) are both preyed on by the predator population (z). p is the density of PA prey, and y = y 1 + y 2 is the density of dormitive prey, with y 1 and y 2 corresponding to the active and dormant subpopulations, respectively. Here, we assume that (1) the dormant form of the dormitive prey is sterile, (2) the dormant form does not contribute to density-dependent growth regulation, and (3) density-dependence applies to growth but not to mortality. The differential equations of this proposed model are:\n",
            " Þy 1 −αy 2 − f y 2 y 2 ð Þz;\n",
            " z ¼ k p f p p ð Þz þ k y 1 f y 1 y 1 ð Þz þ k y 2 f y 2 y 2 ð Þz−d z z:\n",
            " Two types of prey follow the logistic growth model [56] with the environment carrying capacity K and different maximum growth rates (r p , r y ), as well as the predation from the predator at rates f p (p), f y 1 ðy 1 Þ , and f y 2 ðy 2 Þ (Eq. 2). The active form is also supplemented by the dormant form at the termination rate α, and only a fraction of energy, μ(z), is used for the active descendant of the dormitive prey. Therefore, the remaining fraction, 1 − μ(z), is used for the dormant progeny. The predator grows in proportion to the growth efficiencies (k p , k y 1 , k y 2 ) and predation rates (f p (p), f y (y 1 ), f y 2 ðy 2 Þ), while dying at rate d z . Recent published real-world data [11, 14, [30] [31] [32] shown in Table 1 are used to validate our proposed dynamic model. These data have been applied to describe the traits of prey and predator in the competition from the zooplankton modeling literature. Numerical simulations were implemented by the ode23 function in MATLAB that is an implementation of an explicit Runge-Kutta (2,3) pair of Bogacki and Shampine [57] . The accuracy of the simulation is ensured by the strict tolerance level in the repeated experiment, which makes the final coefficient not change significantly and less than 1%. In the simulation, the relative error tolerance and absolute error tolerance are both 10 −8 .\n",

            "Body Text: The presence and diffusion of bioaerosols (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other dead or living organisms including biological debris) in the Earth atmosphere impact ecosystems, climate, and human health (Burrows et al., 2009; Burrows et al., 2009; Fröhlich-nowoisky et al., 2016; Pöschl and Shiraiwa, 2015) . The biosphere directly emits bioaerosols into the atmosphere, which subsequently enables their dispersion and transport even at long distances (Després et al., 2012; Womack et al., 2010) . In the course of atmospheric transport, bioaerosols may undergo further chemical and physical transformation, stress, and biological aging upon interaction with UV radiation, photo-oxidants, and various air pollutants like acids, nitrogen oxides, ozone, and aromatic compounds. All these processes can limit or even suppress the vitality of the living fraction of bioaerosol and therefore affect their capacity to diffuse and to colonize new ecosystems (Womack et al., 2010) . Due to the above challenges, the present knowledge on the ability of viruses and bacteria to spread in the air and diffuse infections and more in general diseases is still immature and demands a wide spectrum of investigation (Middleton, 2017; Morawska and Cao, 2020; Polymenakou, 2012) .\n",
            " Most of the previous studies in the Mediterranean area have been limited to advections of air masses from the Sahara Desert only. The occurrence and impact of this type of air mass, very rich in desert dust, are frequent and well documented (Escudero et al., 2006; Formenti et al., circulation of air masses of different origin and distinguished by nature, type, quality, and extent of contributions (Cusack et al., 2012; Kallos et al., 2014 Kallos et al., , 2007 Petroselli et al., 2018) . Due to the very different characteristics of the source areas, these air masses are expected to carry different bacterial populations and specific chemical markers and pollutants. Moreover only a few studies have used molecular-based approaches to investigate the relationships of different air masses with the bacterial communities in the Mediterranean area. In such studies, bioaerosol characterization was conducted by a low-throughput approach (cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene), while High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) approaches were used in an even smaller number of cases. Most of the previous studies on aerosol-associated microbial communities in the Mediterranean area have been focused on intense Saharan intrusions sampled in the proximity of the dust sources (Gat et al., 2017; Katra et al., 2015; Mazar et al., 2016; Polymenakou et al., 2008) , or after a long-range transport over the Mediterranean basin (Federici et al., 2018; Rosselli et al., 2015; Sanchez De La Campa et al., 2013) . Much less is known about the specific characteristic of the bacterial communities transported by air masses from continental Europe.\n",
            " In this frame, the present study aims at defining the patterns of the bacterial communities of atmospheric aerosol from distinct geographic regions reaching the Mediterranean. The samples were collected during different long-range transport events towards a background monitoring site hypotheses to be tested in this work are two-fold: (i) bacterial community structure associated with long-range transported aerosol in the Central Mediterranean area is significantly different based on the air mass provenance; (ii) there is a correlation between the main aerosol chemical characteristics and the airborne bacterial communities. To test these hypotheses, we investigated the chemical and microbial datasets by cluster analysis, similarity tests, and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis.\n",
            " All the aerosol samples analyzed in this work were collected at the EMEP regional background site of Monte Martano (MM) in Central Italy (42°48'19''N, 12°33'55''E) . MM has been established in a relatively undisturbed location, near a television antenna, on the ridge of a small mountain chain (1100 m asl), above the timberline and facing a completely free horizon (Moroni et al., 2015) . The site is equipped with aerosol, gaseous pollutants, and meteorological monitoring instrumentations (Moroni et al., 2015) . Due to its elevation, the low background concentrations and the 360° free horizon, the site is particularly suited for the assessment of long-range transport events of atmospheric aerosol (Federici et al., 2018; Petroselli et al., 2018a Petroselli et al., , 2018b .

Microvirga was already found in desert-coming air-masses and some species of this genus can reduce nitrogen gas to ammonia (Favet et al., 2013; González-Toril et al., 2020) . It should be also noted that some of the 32 most abundant genera are human-and animal-associated bacteria and include known pathogens, such as Haemophilus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Propionibacterium (Brock et al., 2012) .\n",
            " Moreover, we retrieved some bacterial genera that, despite being ubiquitous in the environment, also contain many opportunistic pathogens and a few pathogens, such as the Pseudomonadales Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, or Clostridium sensu stricto and Clostridium XI (Brown, 2014) . However, analyses based on 16S rRNA sequences do not allow to distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic species or strains.\n",
            " The results of the cluster analysis on the database containing only the abundant genera, summarized by the dendrogram in the right panel of Figure 2 , were used for a data-driven visualization of the samples that are reported in the barplot following the dendrogram order. The average 1-D distances reported in the dendrogram revealed a high β-diversity among the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof bacterial communities of the SH samples, which however generally clustered together. At genus level, the structure of bacterial communities clearly showed differences due to the sample provenance rather than to other factors such as seasonality. Interestingly, amongst the PM samples, the non-Saharan samples collected during regional movements of air masses (RG) and, to a lesser extent, during long-range intrusions (NE and NW), showed a high richness of genera with low abundance, indicating a highly diverse and even community. Conversely, PM during Saharan intrusions showed a lower richness of genera, indicating that these microbial communities were dominated by fewer typical phylotypes. This is in contrast with previous studies, which generally reported higher diversity during dust intrusion events compared to nondust events (González-Toril et al., 2020; Griffin, 2007; Mazar et al., 2016; Polymenakou et al., 2008; Sanchez De La Campa et al., 2013) . It may be hypothesized that, in the case of central Italy, both regional air masses and long-range intrusions from NE and NW mainly cross more heterogenous areas than Saharan intrusions, thus collecting a wider variety of microorganisms.\n",
            " Particularly, when BTs indicated that regional air masses were prevalent, it is also possible that local sources played a major role in shaping bacterial communities. In fact, a wide variety of potential local sources, such as soil surface, leaf surface, water bodies and even animal faeces, To gain further insights about similarities and differences among all the aerosol samples and hypothesize possible effects of the air masses with different origins, a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis was performed using the computation of Bray-Curtis distances between bacterial communities. This statistical method has been applied to the database containing only the abundant genera, and results are shown in Figure 3 . The results of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f NMDS analysis showed a good clustering (stress value < 0.15) of the samples according to their provenance group. In particular, the NMDS1 dimension (x-axis, Figure 3 ) seems to separate well the different clusters, and particularly the Saharan dust samples from the others, while NMDS2 describes the variability within each group.\n",
            " NMDS is a helpful exploratory analysis but does not allow explaining the similarities or dissimilarities among samples, and additional information from other analysis is needed. For example, samples associated with RG and NW air masses show a partial overlap in the NMDS analysis, which is understandable based on the phenomenology of back trajectories (see Figure   1 ). In fact, RG air masses at MM tend to the terrestrial and marine western sectors of peninsular although it has been demonstrated that a number of diseases are linked to desert aerosols (Middleton, 2017) , the concern about Saharan intrusions might be reduced from a public health point of view in this context, since air masses from European and regional origin were more enriched in human-associated bacteria than Saharan air masses. A more detailed boxplot representation of the distribution of the 116 more abundant genera for the four air mass origins is reported in Supplementary Material (figure SM5 ).\n",
            " Chemical and microbiological data were combined to check possible correlations between the variables and the sample provenances. In particular, some typical markers of Saharan dust, biomass burning, and industrial activities, the two latter being particularly enriched in non-Saharan samples, were identified amongst the chemical analytes. Moreover, the analysis of the β diversity showed that the microbial communities of long-range transported Saharan dust were significantly different from those sampled when other air masses were present, strongly supporting the hypothesis that desert dust can impact the bacterial composition of the aerosol at our latitudes (Gat et al., 2017; Mazar et al., 2016; Rosselli et al., 2015) . On the contrary, non-Saharan samples showed similar communities among each other, which in fact clustered together (Figures 2 and 3) . Nevertheless, as observed for the chemical characteristics, even if similarities existed within the PM samples sharing the same origin, the differences were not negligible and suggested that each event was independent of the others. This has been already observed in previous works, at least for dust events. In fact, significant differences in bacterial community J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof structure were reported during different dust events that impacted the same area, even when two events were very close in time (Federici et al., 2018; Yamaguchi et al., 2014) .\n",
            " In order to combine information about microbiology and chemistry, the NMDS1 dimension from the statistical analysis on bacterial communities was correlated with the concentration of chemical variables, normalized against the PM values (w/w). Some of the statistically significant correlations (p = ***) are shown in Figure 5 .\n",
            " Specifically, a significant correlation was found between NMDS1 and PM 2.5 (i.e. PM 2.5 /PM 10 ratio). PM ratio was lower for Saharan dust with the exception of the outlier SH_20141107 which corresponded to the weakest Saharan dust event, with a PM 10 concentration of 8.4 µg/m 3 .\n",
            " The correlation was significant also between NMDS1 and PM coarse ., which was higher for SH because Saharan intrusions are constituted by coarser particles. Organic carbon (OC) content correlated significantly with NMDS1. OC in Saharan dust was lower than in non-Saharan samples because the latter can have a higher anthropogenic contribution. The highest OC/PM 10 values were found for SH_20140624 (which had also high sulphate concentration) and SH_20140522 of NW provenance. As stated above, also many bacterial genera that were significantly more abundant in non-SH than in SH samples (e.g. Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Propionibacterium and Haemophilus) were generally related to anthropic and built environments. This confirms the relevance of the impact that densely populated areas may exert on bacterial populations transported by air masses.\n",
            " Anthracene was the only PAH correlating significantly with NMDS1, being higher for SH samples. The sum of low molecular weight PAHs (LW) was also higher for SH samples.\n",
            " Calcium concentrations showed no correlation with NMDS1, which was interpreted as due to the high local contributions of this element. Iron, on the other side, was richer in SH samples and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof correlated negatively with NMDS1. Ammonium and sulphate concentrations were generally higher for non-Saharan air masses. Innocente et al. (Innocente et al., 2017) also reported that high ammonium and sulphate concentrations were associated with long-range transport from north-west in Milan (North Italy), and those air masses presented a high percentage of\n",
            " Propionibacterium. This is in agreement with our SIMPER analysis, which indicated the genus Propionibacterium as significantly more abundant in NW than in SH samples ( Figure 4 ).\n",
            " However, Innocente and colleagues also reported that this correlation was weak, and ionic composition of air masses was much more clearly related to air mass provenience than to bacterial community structure.\n",
            " Indeed, also in our case, since NMDS1 was strongly correlated to air mass origin, it was not possible to fully understand whether variations in chemical variables were more correlated to variations in bacterial community structure or to dust provenance.\n",
            " In this work, we have characterized the bacterial communities of 19 air masses of different origin, sampled as PM 10 at the remote site of Monte Martano, in Central Italy. This EMEP station is representative of the Central Mediterranean area. The main results of the present work can be summarized as follows:\n",
            "  Four distinctive air masses were identified: previous similar work on this topic was substantially limited to Saharan (SH) dust air masses while in the present study we extended the characterization to regional (RG), North-Western (NW), and North-Eastern (NE) air masses.\n",
            "  At genus level, the distribution of the bacterial populations in air masses clearly showed differences due to the sample provenance. In fact, PM 10 during Saharan intrusions J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof showed a relatively low number of genera, while non-Saharan samples, particularly those collected during regional movements of air masses (RG), showed a high number of different genera with low abundance, indicating a highly diverse and even community.

            "Title: The Use of NanoTrap Particles as a Sample Enrichment Method to Enhance the Detection of Rift Valley Fever Virus\n",
            "Body Text: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) belongs to the genus Phlebovirus and family Bunyaviridae. RVFV is composed of a tripartite singlestranded RNA genome with large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments [1, 2, 3, 4] . RVFV particles have icosahedral symmetry and are 90-110 nm in diameter [4] . The envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer that is embedded with the Gn and Gc glycoproteins. These glycoproteins, which are the most exposed components of the virus during infection, play a crucial role in the entry of the virus into the host cell.\n",
            " RVFV is a highly pathogenic arthropod-borne virus that is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, particularly after heavy rainfall. Although it can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, RVFV primarily affects livestock and humans [2] . Animals are infected through mosquito bites and other arthropod vectors. Humans are typically affected when they come in close contact with infected bodily fluids or tissues, but transmission via mosquito bites, as well as aerosolization may also occur. However, humans are dead-end hosts [1, 5] .\n",
            " Since being first identified in 1930 in the Rift Valley of Kenya, outbreaks have led to high mortality rates as well as significant economic loss [3] . RVFV has remained endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, causing major outbreaks throughout the continent over the last century [6] . In 1976, 200,000 individuals were infected and 600 fatal cases were reported in Egypt [5] . Most likely due to international livestock trade, it has since crossed the Arabian Peninsula into Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Over 30 mosquito species, mostly Aedes and Culex are vectors for RVFV [5] . Of particular concern is that the Aedes species is widely distributed in the EU countries and many of those countries (Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and France) have high-risk vector habitat areas that may serve as emergent sites. Moreover, in the Unites States, this species has been found in 23 states [7] . Since RVFV is capable of utilizing a wide range of mosquito vectors, the virus has the potential to spread further into non-endemic areas [5, 8] .\n",
            " Mortality rates are dependent on species and age. In livestock, mortality rates are as high as 30%. Mortality rates can reach as high as 95% in newborns and the young, while abortion rates are as high as 100% [5] . Symptoms in humans are usually mild and include febrile illness resembling the flu, with a small percentage developing serious clinical manifestations such as retinal lesions, meningoencephalitis, hepatitis, severe hemorrhagic fever, coma and death. In recent years an increase in mortality amongst humans from 2% to 45% has been reported, suggesting evolving mechanisms of virulence and mutations [3] .\n",
            " Due to its transmission via aerosolization, high pathogenicity, and classification as a Group III (bioterrorism potential) Category A emerging infectious disease by the NIAID, work with RVFV requires BSL-3 containment. It is highly suggested that laboratory staff working with RVFV be vaccinated. Therefore, diagnosis of RVFV is restricted to a small number of laboratories. This limitation has led to some delay in diagnostics associated with virus isolation and identification techniques that may pose a problem for healthcare authorities in the event of an RVFV epidemic. There is a crucial need for rapid detection and identification of the virus [3, 5] .\n",
            " NanoTrap particles are a novel technology that can address all the critical analytical challenges for pathogen identification and measurement. They are homogenous hydrogel particles of about 800 nanometers in size that have a shell made of polymers of Nisopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and co-monomers such as acrylic acid (AAc) and allylamine (AA) with cross links of N,N9methylenebisacrylamide (BIS). This shell can be modified to alter permeability or porosity by increasing or decreasing the percentage of BIS [9, 10] . Charge-based affinity baits are incorporated into the NanoTrap particles by copolymerization and covalent binding to the shell [10] . The NanoTrap particles are temperature-and pH-sensitive, decreasing in size with increased temperature and low pH. The molecular sieving properties of the particles depend on several aspects. The degree of cross-linking within the particles provides inclusion and exclusion of high abundance large molecules (e.g. albumin). Affinity baits further facilitate the capture and concentration of the target protein, and prevent it from exiting the particle. They may be of negative or positive charge, therefore attracting analytes of opposite charge. This was seen in an early experiment performed by Luchini et al. where the incubation of particles containing anionic affinity baits captured myoglobin, a protein with a positive charge [9] . Some NanoTrap particles are composed of NIPAm shells, and a few of these shelled NanoTrap particles are also coated with vinyl sulfonic acid (VSA) [11] . NanoTrap particles are able to perform three functions in one step: molecular size sieving, target analyte affinity sequestration, and complete protection of captured analytes from degradation. Furthermore, NanoTrap particles help to bridge the gap between detection and the limits of sensitivity. Mass spectrometry (specifically liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry) is a favored technique for the discovery of candidate biomarkers in biological fluids. However, this technique only accepts a small input volume and complex solutions often lead to decreased sensitivity. The NanoTrap particles concentrate protein analytes in small volumes to effectively amplify the sensitivity of mass spectrometry. In addition, their promiscuity allows for multiple analytes to be harvested from a single sample [9] . Experiments conducted by Luchini et al. demonstrated the capture and enrichment of small molecules spiked in complex solutions such as whole blood and serum [9, 10] . A 2011 study by Douglas et al. on the detection of Lyme disease demonstrated that NanoTrap particles can improve sensitivity more than 100-fold (over existing methods) as well as lead to 100 percent capture and 100 percent elution yield of low abundance antigens in biofluids. Lyme disease antigens at low abundance were detected in both urine samples as well as from a single infected tick [12] .\n",
            " The current library of commercially available NanoTrap particles has been designed to specifically harvest proteins, peptides, metabolites and small molecules. We hypothesized that NanoTrap particles would be able to capture whole virus through the interaction of the NanoTrap particle with the positively charged residues on the surface of RVFV. Our study demonstrates that NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing whole virus, and can be assayed with both qRT-PCR and plaque assays. Importantly, serial dilution studies and studies in serum indicate that NanoTrap particles increase detection sensitivity at lower viral titers. Furthermore, the virus can be inactivated with either heat or detergent, while the virus captured can still be detected with qRT-PCR. Importantly, the NanoTrap particles protect purified viral RNA as well as stabilize the infectivity of RVFV. The studies described here expand upon the NanoTrap particles repertoire to characterize the capture of viruses.\n",

            " There is a dire need for fast and efficient diagnosis of many viral diseases. Our research specifically looked at RVFV, a virus that can only be worked with in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories, and its capture with NanoTrap particles. NanoTrap particles are hydrogel particles that contain internal affinity baits. They have previously been used in the capture of several analytes, but never in the capture of whole virus particles. We were not only able to capture and detect RVFV at very low titers from both media and serum, but we were also able to inactivate the virus, which allows for its safe transport to BSL-2 laboratories. While there are other commercially available beads that can also capture virus, NanoTrap particles are the only beads that can protect the viral RNA from enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that whole virus detection with NanoTrap particles is not limited to only RVFV, but that NanoTrap particles can be used to detect other viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV).\n",

All cell lines were cultured in a humidified environment containing 5% CO 2 at 37uC.\n",
            " The experiments used a live attenuated vaccine derived from the RVFV ZH548 strain, known as MP-12, which had been isolated in 1977 from a patient with uncomplicated RVFV. The virus was generated by 12 serial passages in MRC5 cells, inducing 25 nucleotide changes across the viral genome [13] . Both RVFV ZH548 and MP12 strains were anonymized. MP12 was propagated by infecting Vero cells at 80-90% confluency at an MOI of 0.1 in DMEM+++. Cell culture medium was collected from the cells when ,75% cytopathic effect was observed (typically 72 hours post-infection (hpi)). Cell culture medium was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet the cellular debris. Cell free-viral supernatants were then filtered using a 0.22 mM filter and viral titer determined by plaque assays. Screening experiments for Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) used the live attenuated vaccine TC-83, which had been derived from the Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain by 83 serial passages in fetal guinea pig hearts. This induced changes at 12 nucleotide positions across the viral genome [14] . The viral supernatant of chronically infected J1.1 cells was used in the HIV-1 screening experiments. The LAV strain of HIV-1 had previously been used to infected Jurkat E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 to 0.01 for 2 hours at 27uC and cultured for two weeks. The cells that survived the cytopathic effects of virus infection were cloned and the supernatant from growth-positive wells were screened for Reverse Transcriptase (RT) activity [15] .

            " NanoTrap particles can capture whole virus NanoTrap particles have previously been shown to capture proteins. We hypothesized that the RVFV glycoproteins would be Figure 1 . RVFV capture by NanoTrap particles. A) Seven different types of NanoTrap particles were incubated with viral supernatants containing RVFV (1E+7 pfu/ml) for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed 4 times with water. Viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR assays. B) Percent detected virus was calculated compared to a sample processed without NanoTrap particle incubation. C) Viral supernatants were incubated with NT46, NT53, and NT69 for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed 4 times with water. Serial dilutions followed by plaque assays were performed to determine if full virus was bound by the particles. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g001 capable of interacting with the NanoTrap particles, facilitating capture in a fashion similar to the way in which protein biomarkers interacted with the NanoTrap particles. To test this hypothesis, seven different NanoTrap particles were tested with RVFV. Four NanoTrap particles possessed shells (NT53, NT55, NT69, and NT71) whereas three did not (NT45, NT46, and NT75) ( Table 1) . We incubated culture supernatants from RVFVinfected Veros with each NanoTrap particle. All seven NanoTrap particles successfully captured virus, averaging 6.8E+07 genomic copies per reaction. Specifically, NT46, NT53, and NT69 captured higher genomic copies than the other NanoTrap particles, with each capturing approximately 1.0E+08 genomic copies per reaction ( Figure 1A ). This corresponds to 78-83% capture ( Figure 1B) of a sample containing a high titer of virus.\n",
            " In order to determine if the amplification observed in the qRT-PCR assay was due to the NanoTrap particle capturing intact viral particles or association of viral RNA (presumably due to lysed virus) with the particles, plaque assays were performed. If the particles captured viral RNA or lysed virus, no plaques should be observed. Plaque assays were performed on the three best candidates from the qRT-PCR screening. Captured viruses were not eluted off of the NanoTrap particles, but rather the samples were diluted and added directly to the Vero cells during the plaque assay procedure. We hypothesized that the viral glycoproteins would have a greater affinity for the cellular receptor than the NanoTrap particles and thus would enter the cells. NT53, which contains a cibacron blue bait with a shell, captured infectious RVFV virion six-and four-fold more than NT46 or NT69, respectively ( Figure 1C ). These plaques were not due to cell death induced by the NanoTrap particles themselves, as NanoTrap particles alone did not produce plaques. Therefore NT53 was chosen for all future experiments with RVFV.\n",
            " Experiments were performed to determine potential elution methods that would release the virus without affecting the viral particle integrity. It had previously been found that sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations between 0.5M and 2M could effectively elute various analytes from cibacron blue dyes by disrupting electrostatic interactions between cibacron blue dyes (the bait molecule found within NT53; [16] ). We hypothesized that incubating the RVFV-bound NanoTrap particles on ice would allow the particles to swell and, with the aid of vortexing, the virus would disassociate from the NanoTrap particles. Therefore, we tested a NaCl based elution method coupled with an ice-swelling method. Plaque assays were performed to determine the amount of virus eluted from the NanoTrap particles and the amount that remained bound to the particles after a high salt elution. After NT53 incubation with RVFV, the pellets were resuspended in 2.0 M NaCl in DMEM and placed on ice for 30 minutes with vortexing every ten minutes. Both the eluates and pellets were analyzed by plaque assay ( Figure S1 ). The results showed that 5.5% of RVFV was detected after elution with 2.0M NaCl. The addition of NaCl coupled with incubation on ice only slightly released RVFV virions, demonstrating the virus' strong affinity for the NanoTrap particles. However, as seen in Figure 1B , RVFV-bound NanoTrap pellets directly added to Vero cells during the plaque assays procedure were capable of producing plaques. Based on these results, we opted not to elute RVFV from the NanoTrap particles, but rather to add the RVFV bound to the NanoTrap particles directly during the plaque assay procedure.\n",
            " We next wanted to determine the limit of detection of RVFV in plaque assays with NT53. NT53 was incubated with RVFV at decreasing titers, from 2.5E+6 to 2.5E+1 pfu/ml, and plaque assays performed (Figure 2A) . Captured virus was detected down to 2.5E+1 pfu/ml for RVFV. These results show that NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing whole virus even at low viral titers.\n",
            " We next determined the percentage of RVFV captured by NT53 in comparison to the total input amount. RVFV at 1.0E+6 and 1.0E+3 pfu/ml were added to NT53. At 1.0E+6 pfu/ml, 99.35% of the virus was bound to the NanoTrap particles whereas at 1.0E+03 pfu/ml, ,100% of the virus appeared bound to the NanoTrap particles ( Figure 2B ). The results confirm that the NanoTrap particles are efficient at capturing RVFV, especially at a lower titer. Interestingly, the results also suggest that a small volume of RVFV can be captured with NanoTrap particles and then recultured to grow more virus.\n",
            " RVFV detection is more sensitive with NanoTrap particle incubation\n",
            " In clinical instances of infection, the viral titers in circulation during very early stages after exposure are expected to be low and therefore, hard to detect [17] . We wanted to determine if viral enrichment by the NanoTrap particles (NT53) would enhance detection of RVFV when compared to detection in the absence of enrichment afforded by the NanoTrap. We specifically wanted to see the enrichment potential at lower viral titers when detection would be most difficult. For these assays, we chose to utilize qRT-PCR based detection due to its increased sensitivity over plaque assays. To this end, we spiked RVFV into cell culture media that contained 10% FBS at various concentrations from 1.0E+5 to Figure 2 . Characterization of RVFV NanoTrap particle capture. A) Viral supernatants were serially diluted (2.5E+6 to 2.5E+1 pfu/ml) and incubated with NT53 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The pellets were washed 4 times with water and then particles were tested in plaque assays to determine if full virus was bound by the particles. B) Viral supernatants at 1.0E+6 and 1.0E+3 pfu/ml were incubated with NT53 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sample was spun at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes and the unbound viral supernatant was saved separately. NT53 was washed 4 times with water and then particles were tested in plaque assays to determine how much virus were bound verses unbound by the particles. The percentage of bound virus at 1.0E+6 and 1.0E+3 pfu/ml was graphed. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g002\n",
            " 1.0E+1 pfu/ml. NT53 was then added to 1 ml of the spiked media. Viral capture with and without NanoTrap particles gave similar yields at higher viral titers ( Figure 3A) . However, at lower viral titers, there was a significant increase in viral capture with the use of the NanoTrap particles compared to samples without NanoTrap particle capture. There was greater than a 100-fold increase of viral detection with the use of NT53 at 1.0E+1 pfu/ml.\n",
            " We next wanted to determine if we could capture and enrich virus from a clinically relevant matrix. RVFV was spiked into 100% bovine, donkey, and sheep sera at 1.0E+05 pfu/ml. Incubation of RVFV spiked sera with NT53 resulted in enrichment by 13-, 3-, and 52-fold for bovine, sheep, and donkey sera, respectively ( Figure 3B ). These results demonstrate that NT53 not only captures but also enriches virus found in complicated matrices such as animal sera. The complex analytes (e.g. albumin) found in the sera are likely excluded by the NanoTrap particles and do not interfere with whole virus capture. However, we speculate that since the serum from each of the three animals contains different analytes, there may be interfering proteins that would lead to the observed enrichment differences.\n",
            " NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing inactivated RVFV Viral inactivation is crucial for its transport from the field or a BSL-3 facility to a BSL-2 environment for downstream analysis. However, after inactivation the virus may be susceptible to degradation. Therefore, we wanted to determine if RVFV would remain bound to the NanoTrap particles in an inactivation scenario. After NanoTrap particle incubation with RVFV and subsequent washes, NP-40 detergent was used to inactivate the virus (Figure 4 ). Plaque assays were performed to confirm viral inactivation. Plaque assays demonstrated that 0.1% NP-40 did not fully inactivate the virus incubated with or without NT53 ( Figure 4A ). Higher concentrations of NP-40 (0.5% and 1%) fully inactivated RVFV in the presence or absence of NT53. While the plaque assays confirmed inactivity of RVFV, qRT-PCR data demonstrated that RVFV was still captured following NP-40 addition ( Figures 4B). In the presence of NP-40 the levels of capture with NT53 were decreased as compared to the controls. This is likely due to the interference of the NanoTrap particle binding to RVFV due to the presence of detergent.\n",
            " We next tested the ability of NT53 to function in another commonly employed viral inactivation procedure. The samples were heat inactivated at 57uC for three different time pointsthirty minutes, one hour, and two hours -and plaque assays were performed to confirm viral inactivation. At thirty minutes approximately 1.0E+4 and 1.0E+2 pfu/ml of RVFV with and without NT53, respectively, were still detectable. Interestingly, RVFV was more resistant to heat inactivation in the presence of NT53, suggesting the NanoTrap particles may have a slight protective effect on the virus. However, complete inactivation was achieved at one hour ( Figure 4C ). While the plaque assays confirmed inactivation of RVFV, qRT-PCR data demonstrated the ability of NT53 to detect RVFV nucleic acids after heat inactivation ( Figure 4D ). These data demonstrate that it is possible to fully inactivate the virus before applying downstream assays such as qRT-PCR. Furthermore, these two experiments demonstrate the ability to inactivate a sample and transport it as a noninfectious sample, while still retaining capture.\n",
            " NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing and protecting viral RNA As we observed viral capture in the presence of NP-40, we hypothesized that the virus was being lysed and the released viral RNA recaptured with the NanoTrap particles. If the NanoTrap particles were not providing protection of the viral RNA, there will be no possibility for any downstream assays using inactivated material, which is a critical step in diagnostics. To test this hypothesis, we first lysed the virus with 1% NP-40 and followed by adding NT53 to the lysed material. Results in Figure 5A indicate that NT53 was able to capture the lysed virus. However, there was a 100-fold decrease in lysed virus with the addition of NT53 compared to the control (no NT53) with and without NP-40.\n",
            " These results mirrored what was observed in Figure 4B , where NT53 was capable of capturing virus to a lesser extent in the presence of NP-40. These results demonstrated that RVFV could be initially inactivated by traditional inactivation methods and then captured with NanoTrap particles. By incubating with the NanoTrap particles, the viral RNA will be protected and hence, can be used for downstream RNA detection.\n",
            " In order to directly show that NT53 was able to capture and protect viral RNA, we performed a NanoTrap experiment with purified viral RNA. We first incubated NanoTrap particles with purified RNA, and performed qRT-PCR assays. Results in Figure 3 . RVFV enrichment with NT53 incubation. A) RVFV was spiked into cell culture media (DMEM+++) at various concentrations from 1.0E+5 to 1.0E+1 pfu/ml. NT53 was added to 1 ml of media and captured according to standardize protocols. The pellet was washed 4 times with water, followed by processing with Ambion's MagMax 96well Viral RNA extraction kit. RVFV-spiked media without NT53 were processed in parallel. Viral RNA was quantitated by qRT-PCR with viral specific primers. B) RVFV was spiked into 100% bovine, sheep, and donkey serum at 1.0E+5 pfu/ml. NT53 were added to 1 ml of serum and captured according to a standardize protocol. The pellet was washed 4 times, followed by processing with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit. Serum without NT53 was processed in parallel. Viral RNA was quantitated by qRT-PCR. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g003 Figure 5B demonstrate that NT53 is capable of capturing purified viral RNA, albeit with less affinity than whole virus capture. NT53 was able to capture 0.01% of the input viral RNA. While we screened the NanoTrap particles for whole virus capture, we did not screen the NanoTrap particles for RVFV viral RNA capture. There is likely a NanoTrap particle that captures viral RNA with greater efficiency than NT53.\n",
            " As previous studies have shown that proteins captured by NanoTrap particles were protected from trypsin degradation, we next aimed to determine if NanoTrap particle capture could protect viral RNA from RNase degradation [9, 10] . Samples with and without NT53 were treated with RNase A at 140 or 1400 Units/ml and incubated for one hour at 37uC. Interestingly, the RNA incubated with NT53 was protected from RNase A degradation, whereas the RNA controls were subject to complete RNase A degradation ( Figure 5B ). At 140 Units/ml of RNase A, the captured RNA was detected at the same level as the RNaseuntreated sample. Even at a substantially higher RNase concentration (1400 Units/ml), 1% of the viral RNA input was still detected. Our results demonstrate that the NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing and protecting viral RNA from enzymatic degradation.\n",
            " In some situations, it may be important to retain the infectivity of the captured virus to enable the virus to be propagated for further characterization. Therefore, we evaluated the ability of the NanoTrap particles to capture and preserve the infectivity of RVFV following capture. RVFV was spiked into bovine serum and incubated with or without NT53 at 25uC for 48 or 72 h. In the absence of NT53, the infectivity of RVFV was decreased by ,3 logs ( Figure 5C ). In contrast, samples incubated with NT53 displayed only ,1.5 log decrease by 48 h. Although ,3.5 log decrease was observed with NT53 at 72 h, this still resulted in increased virus detected as compared to the control samples due to the enrichment afforded by NT53. The infectivity of RVFV was also assessed for samples that were incubated at 37uC, which would likely result in a more rapid decline in viral infectivity and thus 24, 48, and 72 h time points were examined. As suspected, a ,4 log decrease was observed in samples incubated at 37uC for 24 h without NT53. In contrast, samples captured by NT53 only displayed ,2 log decrease as compared to the control NT53 sample. At extended time points a further decrease in infectivity was observed with and without NT53, but in all cases a higher amount of infectious virus could be rescued from samples . Viral inactivation following NT53 capture. Panels A and B: NT53 was incubated with viral supernatants containing RVFV at 2.7E+8 pfu/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then incubated at room temperature with 0.1, 0.5 or 1% NP-40 for 1 hour (NP-40). Control samples were not treated with NP-40 nor captured with NT53. Samples treated with NP-40 without NT53 were processed in parallel (black bars). Viral inactivation was assayed by plaque assays (A) and viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR (B). Panels C and D: NT53 was incubated with viral supernatants containing RVFV at 2.7E+8 pfu/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then incubated at 57uC for 30 minutes, one hour, or two hours. Control samples were not heat treated nor captured with NT53. Samples heat-treated without NT53 were processed in parallel (black bars). Viral inactivation was assayed by plaque assays (C) and viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR (D Comparison of capture efficacy of NanoTrap particles and commercially available beads for RVFV capture NanoTrap particles have unique properties not demonstrated in other beads that are used for protein purification and albumin exclusion such as dye baits that make them an ideal candidate in virus capture. Therefore, we wanted to directly compare the ability of other beads to capture RVFV with NT53's RVFV capture capability. The capture of RVFV was tested with NT53 and six commercially available beads used in various assays. DEAE-Sephadex beads are used in ion exchange chromatography for purifying and isolating proteins; Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin are used for isolating nucleic acids and antibodies; Sephacryl S-200 beads are used to purify protein and macromolecules; Biorex 70 Resin beads are used for purification and fractionation of peptides, proteins, and other cationic molecules; SP Sephadex C-25 beads are used in chromatography to separate and purify protein, polypeptides, and other charged molecules; and Bio-gel HTP Hydroxyapatite beads are used in chromatography to separate and purify proteins, nucleic acids, viruses, and other macromolecules. These calcium phosphate beads work by the cationic interaction of the Ca 2+ functional groups with the carboxylate residues located on the protein surface and the anionic interaction of the PO 4 22 functional groups with the basic protein residues. RVFV was incubated with each of these beads and plaque assays were performed to determine whole virus capture. Bio-gel HTP Hydroxyapatite (HTP) captured RVFV the most efficiently, averaging 1.0E+7 pfu/ml, while NT53 performed the second best averaging 2.5E+6 pfu/ml ( Figure 6A ). The other four beads captured RVFV around or below 1.0E+5 pfu/ml.\n",
            " As we have demonstrated that NT53 not only captures intact RVFV, but can also capture and protect viral RNA from RNase A degradation, we tested the ability of HTP to act in a similar capacity. NT53 was able to fully protect the viral RNA against RNase A degradation and genomic copies for NT53 with and without NT53 treatment were similar. However, HTP beads were Figure 5 . NT53 protects viral RNA from degradation and preserves viral infectivity. A) RVFV was lysed with 1% NP-40 for 30 minutes at room temperature and then incubated with NT53 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR. Samples without NT53 and samples without NP-40 were processed in parallel. B) NT53 was incubated with purified RNA at 2.0E+8 genomic copies for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following water washes, the samples were resuspended in water and treated with 140 or 1400 Units/ml of RNase A. Samples with no RNase A treatment were processed in parallel. The viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR. Samples without NT53 were processed in parallel (black bars). C) RVFV (1.4+E7 pfu/ml) was spiked into 1 ml of bovine serum, NT53 added, and samples incubated at 25uC (for 48 or 72 hr) or 37uC (for 24, 48, or 72 h). Samples without NT53 were processed in parallel. Samples were assayed for viral infectivity by plaque assay. Control samples are samples that were processed immediately for plaque assays with no incubation period. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g005 unable to provide protection against RNase degradation, and no viral RNA was detected ( Figure 6B) . A control experiment with RNA alone demonstrated that our RNase treatment was effective. We next compared the ability of NT53 and HTP to capture RVFV during an inactivation scenario. For these experiments NT53 or HTP were added to the samples followed by viral inactivation through treatment with 1% NP-40 or heating at 57uC. The amount of virus captured was quantitated by qRT-PCR ( Figure 6C ). As was observed in previous experiments, viral inactivation with either NP-40 or heat treatment resulted in some loss of RVFV binding to the NanoTrap (1.2 and 0.8 log, respectively). However, HTP RVFV capture was more dramatically affected, resulting in a 2.5 log decrease with the NP-40 treated samples and a 2.7 log decrease in the heat inactivated samples. Collectively, our experiments demonstrate that while HTP is capable of capturing whole virus, it cannot protect viral RNA against RNase degradation and it displays a reduced ability to capture RVFV during an inactivation scenario. In contrast, NT53 is capable of capturing and protecting RVFV as well as capturing RVFV in samples that have been inactivated by heat or detergent treatment.\n",
            " We next asked the question if NanoTrap particles were capable of capturing other viruses. For this, we selected VEEV and HIV-1. VEEV, which at approximately 70 nm in diameter is a smaller virus than RVFV, which is approximately 100 nm in diameter. VEEV viral supernatants were incubated with various NanoTrap particles shown in Table 1 and capture was measured by qRT-PCR. Our data indicated that all six NanoTrap particles successfully captured VEEV, averaging 9.9E+06 genomic copies per reaction ( Figure 7A) , with a slight preference observed with NT45, NT46, and NT55 capturing 1.3E+07, 1.1E+07, and 1.1E+07 genomic copies per reaction, respectively. NanoTrap particles capture was also tested using HIV-1. HIV-1 supernatants from infected J1.1 cells were incubated with NanoTrap particles. RNA extraction was performed, cDNA was synthesized, and RT-PCR was performed. A semi-quantitative analysis shown in Figure 7B , demonstrated that all seven NanoTrap particles were able to capture HIV-1 with NT46 and NT53 demonstrating the best capture ( Figure 7B ). These results indicate that NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing multiple viruses. (7) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sample was washed 4 times with water and then particles were tested in plaque assays to determine how much virus was bound by the particles. B) NT53 or HTP was incubated with purified RNA at 1.0E+7 genomic copies for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following water washes, the samples were resuspended in water and treated with 380 Units/ml of RNase A. Samples with no RNase A treatment were processed in parallel. The viral RNA was extracted from isolated particles and quantitated by qRT-PCR (black bars). Samples without NT53 were processed in parallel (gray bars). C) NT53 and HTP beads were incubated with viral supernatants containing RVFV at 1.7E+8 pfu/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then inactivated by incubation at 57uC for one hour or incubating in the presence of 1% NP-40 at room temperature for 1 hour. A ''no bead'' control processed in parallel was included for each condition. Viral RNA was extracted from the particles and quantitated by qRT-PCR. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g006 Viral infections in nature do not occur in isolation and are often accompanied by other co-infections (bacterial and/or viral); therefore we sought to determine if the NanoTrap particles could capture RVFV in a ''mixed'' infection setting. To this end, bovine serum was spiked with RVFV only or with both RVFV and HIV, followed by NT53 viral capture and quantification as measured by qRT-PCR. Results indicated that NT53 was capable of capturing and enriching RVFV from samples that contained only RVFV or both RVFV and HIV ( Figure 7C ). Seven-fold enrichment was observed in samples containing RVFV only and 5-fold enrichment from samples containing both RVFV and HIV. These data provide evidence that the NanoTrap particles could be used with clinical samples.\n",
            " Therefore, in conclusion, the results demonstrate that Nano-Trap particles can capture and enrich RVFV from both cell culture media and clinically relevant matrices. The captured virus can then be inactivated and viral RNA protected from enzymatic degradation. The bound RVFV can be eluted off the NanoTrap particles, and used in downstream assays such as plaque assays and qRT-PCR. Furthermore, NanoTrap capture can be extended to other viruses as well, including VEEV and HIV.\n",
            " Rift Valley Fever Virus is a zoonotic virus that primarily affects livestock but has the potential to cause severe disease in humans.\n",
            " RVFV has led to outbreaks in Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula with the potential to spread to the United States and Europe. Changes in climate, travel, and trade have made RVFV an emerging disease that can have deadly economic and social consequences. Furthermore, RVFV is of biodefense interest due to its potential spread via aerosolization. There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines, so there is a reliance on sensitive and specific diagnostics early on in infection.\n",
            " The current state of RVFV diagnostics includes virus isolation, nucleic acid techniques, and antibody detection. Current RT-PCR-based assays require a critical amount of the virus circulating in the system. This can lead to misdiagnosis, especially falsenegative results, of the disease early on in infection. In contrast, our results demonstrate the ability of NanoTrap particles to enrich for RVFV from both cell culture supernatants as well as more complex matrices such as animal serum. The capability of NanoTrap particles to enrich virus is crucial early on in infection during which the virus can go undetected using other diagnostic methods. In our serum sample studies we noted different levels of enrichment depending on the source of the serum. For example, NanoTrap particles incubated in donkey serum resulted in a 52fold increase in RVFV detection sensitivity, whereas incubation in sheep serum only displayed a 3-fold increase. The presence of other analytes found in serum may be competing for capture with NanoTrap particles, which likely will differ between species as well Figure 7 . Capture of other viruses with NanoTrap particles. A) Six different types of NanoTrap particles were incubated with viral supernatants containing VEEV for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed 4 times with water. Viral RNA was extracted and quantitated by qRT-PCR assays. B) Seven different types of NanoTrap particles were incubated with 1 ml J1.1 supernatant for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed 4 times with water. The pellets were diluted in 100 ul water and RNA extracted. A cDNA synthesis using 150 ng of each sample was performed and followed by PCR using 10 ul cDNA. A DNA gel was run to determine viral capture. A sample with no reverse transcriptase added and a sample with just water were used as negative controls. The volume of each band was quantified and graphed. C) Bovine serum was spiked with RVFV (1.0E+6 pfu/ml) only or both RVFV (1.0E+6 pfu/ml) and HIV (100 ml of J.1. supernatants). Samples were incubated with NT53 for 30 minutes, viral RNA extracted and quantitated by qRT-PCR. Samples without NT53 were processed in parallel (black bars). doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g007 as between individual animals. Importantly we have also demonstrated the ability to capture RVFV in samples that also contained HIV. This is an important area of investigation, as clinical samples will likely contain multiple pathogens, providing further competition for NanoTrap binding. We hope to extend our spiked serum sample studies to experiments with serum samples taken from animals exposed to RVFV and human clinical samples. These studies will allow further optimization of the NanoTrap particle collection. In our current study we used very stringent wash conditions to ensure that the virus captured was tightly bound to the NanoTrap particles. In clinical samples, it may be necessary to decrease the number of wash steps to ensure that the maximum amount of virus is being captured from more complex samples. Alternatively, different wash buffers (altering salt and detergent concentrations) could be utilized to allow more selective binding of analytes. Due to the complex nature of clinical samples, it may also be necessary to increase the amount of NanoTrap particles added to prevent saturation. Nonetheless, our studies provide an important first step in the application of NanoTrap particles as a sample preparation and enrichment process to improve diagnostics from serum samples.\n",
            " One important advantage of utilizing NanoTrap particles is their ability to protect analytes from degradation. Previous studies have indicated that protein captured by NanoTrap particles are protected from trypsin degradation [9, 10] . In these experiments PDGF was incubated with an excess of trypsin. Following incubation the majority of the trypsin was found outside of the NanoTrap particles. However, even though some of the trypsin entered the particles, PDGF was completely protected from degradation. In the current study we extend these findings to demonstrate that viral RNA was protected from degradation in the presence of RNase A. Sample preservation is critical for stabilization of sample integrity both during field collection and during transported to diagnostic facilities. Bio-gel HTP Hydroxyapitite, while able to capture RVFV was unable to protect viral RNA from degradation, further demonstrating the advantage of using NanoTrap particles over other commercially available chromatography beads.\n",
            " Another critical aspect of the NanoTrap particles is the ability to collect viral samples and inactivate them to render them noninfectious, while still retaining the ability to detect the analyte of interest. This was demonstrated by captured of RVFV by NT53 followed by inactivation of RVFV with NP-40 (determined by plaque assays). Following inactivation, viral genetic material was still detected with qRT PCR and to a higher level than that observed with HTP beads. This is of particular importance in the transport of RVFV from a BSL-3 environment or field sample collection setting to a BSL-2 laboratory for diagnostic testing. Given that BSL-3 laboratories are both difficult to access and work in a BSL-3 environment is time-consuming and expensive, the inactivation method will allow for fewer lapses in time between obtaining the samples and the determining the results. In addition, as the NanoTrap particles allow the capture of the whole virus, the samples can then be analyzed with a variety of downstream analysis methods such as ELISA for the nucleoprotein of RVFV, western blotting, plaque assays, and qRT-PCR.\n",
            " The exact mechanism of NanoTrap binding to RVFV is unclear at this point. We hypothesize the NanoTrap particle capture is occurring through interactions with RVFV's glycoproteins, Gn and Gc. Gn and Gc are the only viral proteins available for capture by virtue of being exposed on the outside of the virion. The fact that the binding observed with HTP beads slightly exceeded NT53 in binding RVFV may provide insight into the mechanism of binding. HTP is known to bind primarily through electrostatic interactions and similarly, Cibacron blue, the affinity bait component of NT53 binds through electrostatic, hydrophobic or a combination of surface and electrostatic interactions. Based on these results, we expect that electrostatic interactions may provide the dominant mode of NT53 binding to RVFV. Due to the size of the virus (90-100 nm) as compared to the size of the NanoTrap particles (800 nm), it is unclear if the viruses are entering inside the core of the NanoTrap particle or binding to the outside of the NanoTrap particles. We have observed preferentially binding of RVFV with NanoTrap particles containing Cibracon blue baits, suggesting that the bait plays at least a partial role in the binding. Even if RVFV binding is partially or primarily found on the surface of the NanoTrap particles, the particles provide a unique advantage over other commercially available beads, which is sequestration of analytes within the NanoTrap particles. This is important as many enzymes (proteases, RNase,etc.) found in serum can rapidly digest protein and RNA. However, the NanoTrap particles can bind to small molecular weight proteins (such as trypsin) rendering them inactive [9] , thereby providing protection for other proteins and/or viruses captured by the NanoTrap particles.\n",
            " NanoTrap particles can be engineered with increased pore sizes to facilitate capture of RVFV inside the NanoTrap particles. This approach has the added advantage of ensuring capture within the particles themselves, which would be predicted to further increase the stability of the virus as well as increase the viral binding capacity of the NanoTrap particles. One potential disadvantage of larger pores sizes would be the loss of some of the sieve sieving capabilities of the particles. The size sieving is important for more complex samples (whole blood, sera, etc.), which would benefit from the ability of the NanoTrap particles to enrich for certain analytes (i.e. viruses) while excluding high abundant proteins such as BSA, which may interfere with downstream assays or mask lower abundant molecules such as low levels of viruses. However, it may be possible to obtain a balance of larger pores with efficient size sieving if the appropriate level of cross-linking could be achieved. This is an active area of research and warrants further investigation.\n",
            " Our results demonstrated that NanoTrap particle capture was not limited to RVFV, but could be extended to other viruses including VEEV and HIV. All three of these viruses are enveloped RNA viruses. Future studies will focus on the capture and enrichment of different viral classes, including DNA viruses and non-enveloped viruses. That capture of a wide range of viruses is especially important when multiple viruses cause the same type of disease and/or the symptoms of infection are very general. For example, respiratory infections can be attributed to multiple pathogens, including Influenza A and B viruses, Coronaviruses, and Adenoviruses. For this type of application, the promiscuity of the NanoTrap particles is particularly important, as it will allow the capture and enrichment of multiple viruses from the same sample. Therefore, we believe that increasing sensitivity for respiratory viral infections is an important diagnostic issue that the NanoTrap particles could address.\n",
            " In conclusion, our results have demonstrated that NanoTrap particles are able to capture and enrich whole virus. While other commercially available beads can also capture virus, only Nano-Trap particles are capable of protecting the integrity of the virus after inactivation with detergent or exposure to RNase A. However, further research is needed to determine the exact mechanism by which the NanoTrap particles capture and protect the virus. Figure S1 Elution with NaCl as demonstrated by plaque assays. RVFV supernatants were incubated with NT53 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sample was spun at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. NT53 was washed 4 times with water and then particles were eluted with DMEM+2M NaCl and incubated on ice for 30 minutes with vortexing every 10 minutes. The particles were tested in plaque assays to determine how much virus was eluted off of the particles. (TIF)\n",

Its normal habitat is unknown, but it is frequently found in water, soil and other damp environments (Chihab et al., 2004) . It contains a polysaccharide capsule and multitrichous polar flagella. The capsule has been associated with adsorption of cadmium and cobalt ions (Hawkins et al., 1991; Kostman et al., 1991; Ozdemir et al., 2005) .\n",

The organism may also behave as a nosocomial agent and infect critically ill patients who have undergone surgical procedures and/or had indwelling devices inserted. The infection has also been associated with factors such as immunosuppressive therapy, chronic renal failure and malignancy (Chihab et al., 2004) . Recently, this organism has been described as causing an unusual clinical infection mimicking mediastinal malignant lymphoma in a human patient (Goteri et al., 2010) .

            " Between 2008 and 2009, three unrelated domestic ferrets (animal numbers 1, 2 and 3) kept as pets by different owners in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain, presented with respiratory disease. All three were males, one was neutered (number 1) and none had contact with other ferrets or animals. Ferrets 1 and 2 were 3 years old and ferret 3 was 2 years old. The animals were not vaccinated against canine distemper virus or rabies. Ferrets 1 and 2 presented with depression, dehydration, anorexia, hyperthermia and acute onset dyspnoea. There was no history of prior medical problems. Complete blood counts and serum biochemical examinations revealed anaemia, severe neutrophilic leucocytosis with toxic neutrophils, hyperglycaemia and hypoalbuminaemia. Ferret 2 also had hyperglobulinaemia. Radiographic findings included a unilateral pleural effusion (right-and left-sided in ferrets 1 and 2, respectively) and a mediastinal mass displacing the trachea dorsally. Ultrasonographically, in ferret 2 there was a large quantity of hypoechoic effusion within the thorax and a heterogeneous ill-defined soft tissue mass was observed in the left mediastinum. Approximately 20 ml of purulent fluid were removed by thoracocentesis. Both ferrets were treated similarly with oxygen supplementation, crystalloid fluids, antibiotics (enrofloxacin, clindamycin and metronidazole), itraconazole, buprenorphine, ranitidine and sucralphate. Both animals died within 2e5 days of presentation.\n",
            " Ferret 3 had a history of recurrent and vaguelydefined problems consisting mainly of cough. The animal presented with acute, severe dyspnoea and was humanely destroyed without diagnosis or treatment at the request of the owner.\n",
            " Smears of pleural exudates were made from each of the ferrets and these were stained with Diff-Quik.\n",
            " Two ferrets were subject to necropsy examination. Ferret 1 was submitted to the Pathology Department at the Veterinary School of Barcelona; ferret 3 was examined by the referring clinician and tissue samples were submitted to a private diagnostic pathology laboratory. Tissue samples from mediastinal lymph nodes, lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, intestine and brain were collected from ferret 1. Samples of lung, mediastinal lymph node, mediastinal mass, trachea and oesophagus were taken from ferret 3. Samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and processed routinely.\n",
            " Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned (4 mm) and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Gram, ZiehleNeelsen (ZN), alcian blue and periodic acideSchiff (PAS) stains were also performed on serial sections from ferrets 1 and 3. Gram, ZN and PAS staining was performed on the pleural exudate of ferret 2.\n",
            " Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) antigen (Custom Monoclonals International, Sacramento, CA, USA; dilution 1 in 400), canine distemper virus (CDV) nucleoprotein (Ingenasa, Madrid, Spain; dilution 1 in 1,000) and influenza A (IA) nucleoprotein (CReSA, Barcelona, Spain; dilution 1 in 100) in lung and mediastinal tissues from ferrets 1 and 3, following the protocols previously described (Domingo et al., 1992; Gooskens et al., 2007; Mart ınez et al., 2008) . Negative control procedures included omission of primary antiserum. Tissue sections known to be negative and positive for expression of FRSCV, CDV and IA were included as additional controls.\n",
            " For in-situ hybridization (ISH), a 22 base pair (bp) digoxigenin-labelled DNA probe (5 0 Dig-TCTCTG AGGTATGGCCGTAACT 3 0 ) was used to detect DNA from Pneumocystis spp. in pulmonary and mediastinal tissues from ferrets 1 and 3, as previously described (Rosell et al., 1999) . Controls included tissues known to be negative and positive for Pneumocystis spp.\n",
            " Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to examine the pleural exudate obtained from ferret 2 and the formalin-fixed lung and lymph node from ferrets 1 and 3. After evaluating the stained slides, areas of the embedded formalin-fixed tissue where bacterial colonies were most abundant were selected for TEM. Pleural exudate was fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (EM grade, TAAB Laboratories, Berkshire, UK) in 100 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 2 h and rinsed four times with 100 mM PBS.\n",
            " Pellets from pleural exudate, lung and lymph node were then post-fixed in 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide (TAAB) containing 0.8% (w/v) potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) (Sigma, Madrid, Spain) 2 h and washed with 100 mM PBS. These steps were performed at 4 C. Samples were dehydrated through a graded acetone series, embedded in Epon resin and polymerized for 48 h at 60 C. Ultrathin sections were mounted in copper grids (200 mesh), contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate solutions and evaluated with a transmission electron microscope (Jeol JEM-1400 equipped with a Gatan Ultrascan ES1000 CCD camera).\n",
            " The pleural exudate obtained by thoracocentesis from ferret 2 was cultured on 5% sheep blood agar and Mac-Conkey agar. Plates were incubated at 37 C in 5% CO 2 and examined after 24 and 48 h. The isolates were identified using the API-20NE identification system (bio-M erieux, Madrid, Spain). For mycological isolation, pleural exudate was cultured on Sabouraud's glucose agar with chloramphenicol and incubated at 25 C.\n",
            " The 16S rRNA gene of the bacterial isolate obtained from ferret 2 was amplified using universal primers for bacteria (Calsamiglia et al., 1999) and sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator 3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A fragment of 1399 bp of this gene was analyzed. For sequence identification, Classifier and SeqMatch analysis tools in RDP (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) and BLAST at NCBI (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) were used. For phylogenetic reconstruction, the sequence was aligned with 197 type strains of the Pseudomonadales available at RDP. A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was constructed using the TamuraeNei substitution model and the Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI) ML heuristic method and evaluated with 1,000 bootstraps. The tree was rooted using the 16S rRNA gene of Escherichia coli K12.\n",
            " The pleural exudate consisted of neutrophilic inflammation with abundant clusters of rod-shaped to serpentine microorganisms measuring up to 2e3 mm in length, with a clear halo (Fig. 1) .\n",
            " At necropsy examination, ferrets 1 and 3 had approximately 5e10 ml of dense and serosanguinous pleural exudate. Ferret 1 showed multiple white and slightly raised nodules (1e2 mm) in the visceral pleura and pulmonary parenchyma. In ferret 1, the mediastinal mass observed radiographically correlated with a severe mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Fig. 2) , with abundant purulent exudate on the cut surface. Ferret 3 had a large white mass in the mediastinum which encircled the trachea, oesophagus and regional lymph nodes.\n",
            " Microscopical examination of the mediastinal lymph node from ferret 1 revealed a severe, multifocal to diffuse, necrotizing and neutrophilic to pyogranulomatous inflammation with variable infiltration of macrophages and lymphoplasmacytic cells. This process extended to the mediastinum. There were abundant colonies of rod-shaped (2e3 mm long) eosinophilic and gram-negative microorganisms with a clear and wide halo (capsule). Many of these organisms had capsules that stained positively with PAS and alcian blue (Fig. 3) . In the lung, the small white nodules observed grossly consisted of multifocal peribronchiolar aggregates of foamy macrophages. Bacterial colonies were not observed associated with these lesions.\n",
            " Similar lesions were observed in the mediastinal lymph nodes of ferret 3 and these extended to the pleura and oesophagus. This severe and diffuse pyogranulomatous inflammation was also observed in the lungs and was accompanied by thrombosis, lymphoid hyperplasia and mesothelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Numerous bacterial colonies, as described above, were observed in the mediastinal lymph nodes, bronchiolar lumen and pleura. Moderate numbers of these organisms had capsules stained by alcian blue, but only a few were PAS positive.\n",
            " No lesions were observed in the other organs examined and ZN staining, ISH for Pneumocystis spp. and IHC for FRSCV, CDV and IA were negative in both ferrets.\n",
            " The pleural effusion contained few leucocytes, but there were large numbers of gram-negative bacteria individually surrounded by a fibrillar matrix and forming multiple packets (or clusters). The bacteria were ultrastructurally intact (consistent with viability); some showed evidence of division and contained nucleic acid strands in the nucleoid (or nuclear zone) and cytoplasmic ribosomes. Each bacterium was 2e3 mm long and surrounded by a thick capsule (2e3 mm) comprised of concentric layers of fibrillar material. In addition, there were tiny electron-dense granules of unknown origin within the capsular matrix. The outer cell membrane was surrounded by a tubulovesicular matrix. Bacterial surfaces frequently contained multiple vesicular blebs of cell membranes (Fig. 4) . The inflammatory cells consisted of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes. Monocytes and neutrophils had undulated surfaces, but both lacked phagocytic vacuoles.\n",
            " Pure cultures of yellow-pigmented colonies of gramnegative rods were obtained on both blood and Mac-Conkey agars. The isolate was identified as P. luteola. Mycological culture was negative after 14 days of incubation.\n",
            " Molecular analysis identified the isolate as belonging to the genus Pseudomonas with a score of 100% (Confidence interval 80%). Using SeqMatch, the best hit (score 0.972) was P. luteola IAM13000, the type strain of this species. Using BLASTn, the best hit was P. luteola Marseille, with a nucleotide identity of 99% (1395/1399 bp). This classification inside P. (Chryseomonas) luteola was confirmed by phylogenetic reconstruction (Fig. 5) . \n",
            " The present report describes a newly recognized respiratory bacterial infection of ferrets presenting with acute dyspnoea, pyothorax and severe pyogranulomatous pleuropneumonia, lymphadenitis and mediastinitis. Bacterial culture and molecular taxonomy confirmed P. luteola as the causative agent in one animal. Although microbiological cultures could not be performed in the other two cases, the intralesional microorganisms were indistinguishable from each other by cytological and histopathological examination as well as by TEM. For this reason, we hypothesize that P. luteola could be the cause of this pyogranulomatous pneumonia and mediastinitis in all of these ferrets. P. luteola infection has been described in rainbow trout (Altinok et al., 2007) , but no cases have been found in animals, birds or reptiles. In mink, P. aeruginosa causes a fatal and acute haemorrhagic suppurative pneumonia, but no predisposing factors have been conclusively identified (Trautwein et al., 1962; Long and Gorham, 1982) . Previous studies in man showed that P. luteola may cause septicaemia, peritonitis, meningitis, dermatitis and endocarditis in patients with different underlying diseases or with indwelling devices (Chihab et al., 2004) . The ferrets of this report probably acquired the infection by the respiratory route, as other organs were not affected. However, the origin of the infection and the incubation period remain unknown. Humans (owners and clinicians) that came in contact with these animals did not show clinical signs of illness at any time, including before and after the animals were clinically ill. However, a clinical infection in a human patient mimicking mediastinal lymphoma caused by P. luteola has been described recently, and in that case there were similar histopathological lesions and microorganism morphology (Goteri et al., 2010) as described for the ferrets of this report. These results may suggest a predilection of this infection for the lower respiratory tract and the mediastinal lymph nodes of man and ferrets. Thus, this infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of pyogranulomatous pleuropneumonia and mediastinitis in the ferret and further research is needed to elucidate the zoonotic potential of ferrets in the transmission of the infection.\n",
            " The unusual morphology of the microorganisms initially suggested that they may be fungal in nature (e.g. Sporothrix spp.). However, TEM confirmed that the agent was a bacterium. TEM revealed numerous viable and dividing bacteria with surfaces frequently contained multiple vesicular blebs of cell membranes, a change consistent with endotoxin release. Moreover, viable leucocytes were present, but no phagocytosis was observed, suggesting that the inflammatory response in these animals was unable effectively to fight the infection. Based on this observation, we offer two hypotheses. The first is based on the possibility that bacteria were able to elude the inflammatory response; the second hypothesis speculates an ineffective immune reaction due to immune suppression or concomitant infectious and non-infectious diseases.\n",
            " In support of the first hypothesis, the literature shows evidence that the genus Pseudomonas has a polysaccharide capsule and flagella. The polysaccharide capsule has been associated with an antiinflammatory effect in P. aeruginosa infection in human patients with cystic fibrosis. In contrast, flagella are related to the stimulation of innate host defence (Cobb et al., 2004) . In this case, the abundant bacterial colonies with a thick polysaccharide capsule, coupled with the absence of flagella and phagocytosis observed by TEM, could have triggered a similar evasion mechanism of the inflammatory reaction in ferrets. On the other hand, bacterial capsules were positively stained by PAS and alcian blue, with more abundant positive colonies in ferret 1 than 3. This could suggest the presence of different clones of the same bacteria or, possibly, chemical changes in bacterial capsule during the course of infection, for which the significance is unknown. With regard to the second hypothesis, the diagnostic techniques used showed no predisposing, concomitant, infectious or non-infectious disease. No previous immunosuppressive therapy was reported, no histological evidence of predisposing viral or toxic damage was observed and IHC was negative for some of the most common ferret viral pathogens, including AI, Fig. 5 . A fragment of 1399 bp of the 16S rRNA gene of isolate P. luteola 571 was aligned with 197 type strains of the Pseudomonadales. A maximum likelihood tree was constructed using the TamuraeNei substitution model and the Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI) ML heuristic method and evaluated with 1,000 bootstraps. Only bootstrap values >50 are indicated. The tree was rooted using the 16S rRNA of E. coli K12. Branching of isolated P. luteola is amplified and the isolated label highlighted by a black square.\n",
            " CDV and FRSCV. Other microorganisms that could produce similar pyogranulomatous lesions (e.g. Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Actinomyces, Pneumocystis or fungi) were discarded by microbiological culture, ISH and special stains. However, stress periods or other intrinsic immune defects that may induce immune suppression could not be ruled out. P. luteola has been considered to be a secondary pathogen in human patients. However, a primary pathogenic role remains possible in the ferret. As these animals are becoming very popular domestic pets, gaining a greater understanding of the origin and dynamics of infection in ferrets may improve our knowledge of possible transmission to man, especially in those patients who are immune compromised or affected by cystic fibrosis.\n",

            "Title: Survival of Enveloped and Non-Enveloped Viruses on Inanimate Surfaces\n",
            "Body Text: Non-enveloped viruses, such as coxsackieviruses, rotavirus, or poliovirus, can survive for extended periods on surfaces (9, 10) , while enveloped viruses, including H1N1 and human coronaviruses, remain infectious on surfaces after several days (6) . The persistence of dried viruses is affected by various environmental conditions and factors such as heat, moisture, pH, and the type of surface (12, 15) . Furthermore, the compositions of media may also influence the persistence of viruses. The impact of drying on viral persistence has been evaluated in previous studies using viruses typically prepared in standardized media, including a cell culture medium supplemented or not with fetal calf serum (FCS) (4, 19) . However, these media are not representative of clinical situations because viruses have been detected in protein-rich media, such as serum, and protein-poor media, including water (11, 17) .\n",
            " In the present study, the persistence of two enveloped viruses, influenza virus type A (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and two non-enveloped viruses, minute mouse virus (MVM) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), was investigated. These viruses are relevant models for assessing viral persistence. MVM is a member of the Parvoviridae family, which is known to be resistant to desiccation (9) , and the other viruses have been implicated in nosocomial infections (5) . Furthermore, infectious titers higher than 10 6 TCID 50 mL −1 can be obtained for each virus in vitro.\n",
            " In addition, components of virus-containing media may affect viral persistence. Therefore, the influence of concentrations of common media components (fetal bovine serum [FCS] , bovine serum albumin [BSA] and sodium chloride [NaCl]) on the persistence of CVB4 was also investigated.\n",
            " CVB4 E2 is a strain provided by Ji-Won Yoon (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) (8, 13) . HSV-1 (ATCC VR-260), CVB4, MVM (ATCC VR-1346), and H1N1 A/PR/8/34 (ATCC VR-1469) were propagated on Vero (ATCC CCL-81) cells, Hep-2 (ATCC CCL-23) cells, A9 (EACC N° 85011426) cells, and MDCK (NBL2) (ATCC CCL-34) cells, respectively. Infected A9 cells cultured in supplemented DMEM and supplemented MEM (Invitrogen, France) were used to culture Vero and Hep-2 cells. MEM and DMEM media were supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% L-glutamine at 37°C and incubated in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Infected MDCK cells were cultured in MEM at 35°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. When cell lysis reached at least 75%, the inoculated flasks were scratched, freeze-thawed three times, and centrifuged at 2,000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was aseptically aliquoted and stored in a −80°C freezer. The viral titer was determined by limiting a dilution assay to 50% of the tissue culture infection dose by the method of Spearman-Kärber method and expressed as log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (7) .\n",
            " CVB4E2-positive strand RNA was quantitated by two-step quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (15) . Briefly, total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, California). Total RNA was retro-transcribed to cDNA using the Affinityscript QPCR cDNA synthesis kit and a specific reverse primer at 42°C for 15 min. Positive strand-specific RT was quantitated by the brilliant II QPCR kit (Agilent Technologies Stratagene) under universal cycle conditions (10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 60°C) on a Mx3000p (Stratagene). Primers were located within the enterovirus 5'-nontranslated region, which was highly conserved among enterovirus serotypes: CVB4 forward (5'-CCCTGAAT GGGGCTAATC) and CVB4 reverse (5'-ATTGTCACCATA AGCAGCCA). The sequence of the CVB4 probe was 5'-VIC-AACCGACTACTTTGGGTGTCCGTGTTT-TAMRA (Applied Biosystems). Negative controls were performed by RT-PCR without the reverse transcriptase enzyme or without DNA. Primers and probe pairs were designed with PrimerExpress software, and data were analyzed with Sequence Detector version 1.6.3 (both from Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts). Results were expressed as the cycle threshold (Ct)\n",
            " Fifty microliters (10 µL for iterative drying) of the virus inocula were applied to the middle of each petri dish lid (35-mm diameter [Falcon]), and dried under the air flow of a class II biological safety cabinet at room temperature. The air flow speed was 0.4 m s −1 and the relative humidity was measured using a relative humidity meter (Temperature and Humidity Data logger, IHM). Medium (1 mL) was added to recover dried virus inocula. The infectious titers of harvested fluids were then determined and the results expressed as described above.\n",
            " Statistical analyses of the results were performed by the Mann-Whitney U test using Graphpad Prism version 5.00 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, USA) when appropriate. Differences were considered to be significant when P <0.05.\n",
            " Fifty microliters of clarified culture supernatant fluids from cells infected with CVB4, MVM, H1N1, or HSV-1 were applied to petri dish lid surfaces and then dried under the airflow of a class II biological safety cabinet at room temperature (20 ± 2°C). The dried inocula were recovered and titrations were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section.\n",
            " Samples were considered dried when liquid was no longer observed on the lids, which occurred within 2 h. The mean values of the infectious titers of droplets containing HSV-1, H1N1, and CVB4 were reduced by 2.33 log 10 ; 1.1 log 10 ; 1.5 log 10 , respectively, 2 h after the inoculation (Fig. 1 ). Infectious viruses were not detected in dried HSV 1 and H1N1 inocula recovered 3 and 5 d after inoculation. In contrast, the viral titers in dried CVB4 inocula recovered 2 h to 5 d post inoculation were unchanged (4.39 +/− 0.38 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 , n=4). The viral titer of MVM in dried inocula recovered one week post inoculation was unchanged and similar to the titers measured in drops applied to the lids (5.87 +/− 0.20 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 n=4). No infectious particle was detected in dried CVB4 inocula 6 weeks after inoculation, whereas a significant amount of infectious particles was recovered from dried MVM inocula (0.5 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 [detection limit] vs 4.00 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 , respectively, P <0.02).\n",
            " Reductions in the infectious titers in recovered inocula when drops were dried on petri dish lids raised several issues. The efficiency of recovering viral particles in these conditions was questioned. The infectious titer of CVB4 was determined to address this issue, and RNA was also extracted to measure the amount of viral RNA by RT real-time PCR in order to estimate the level of viral particles. The amounts of viral RNA in recovered inocula dried for 2 h at room temperature and in fresh inocula were similar, as displayed by the pattern of Ct values obtained by RT real-time PCR (mean values were 24.36 vs. 23.86, respectively, P=0.56), whereas the infectious titer values were markedly different (2.17 log 10 reduction P=0.028) (Fig. 2) . Taken together, these results demonstrated that viral particles dried on petri dish lids were readily recovered.\n",
            " Thus, after drying on a plastic surface, the non-enveloped viruses, CVB4 and MVM, remained infectious for a longer period of time than the enveloped viruses, H1N1 and HSV-1.\n",
            " The patterns of resistance of MVM, CVB4, H1N1, and HSV-1 were examined. Ten microliters of each clarified supernatant fluid containing MVM, CVB4, H1N1, and HSV-1 was dried as described above. Repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension were carried out: 10 µL of sterile distilled water was added to a dried spot to start a new cycle of drying. Thereafter, dried inocula were recovered using 1 mL of culture medium and the viral titers were determined. Fifty microliters of each culture supernatant fluid containing H1N1, CVB4, HSV-1, or MVM was applied to Petri dish lids in quadruplicate. They were dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet at room temperature from 2 h to 6 weeks. Thereafter, dried inocula were recovered using 1 mL of titer media and the infectious titers were determined and expressed as log 10 . The results are the mean ± SD of four independent experiments. The dashed line represents the detection limit of the test. Each drying cycle resulted in a gradual reduction in the viral titers of H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 of approximately −0.4, −1.1, and −1.8 log 10 TCID 50 10 µL −1 per cycle, respectively (Fig. 3) . No reduction in the viral titer was detected for MVM after each cycle of drying. Furthermore, a reduction in viral titers was not observed in clarified supernatant fluids containing viruses kept at room temperature for the duration of the experiment (data not shown).\n",
            " These results showed that iterative drying resulted in reductions in the viral titers of H1N1, CVB4, and HSV-1, whereas those of MVM remained unchanged.\n",
            " Media containing various concentrations of FCS, BSA, and NaCl diluted in distilled sterile water were spiked with 1% of clarified CVB4-containing supernatants. Fifty microliters of these viral suspensions were applied to petri dish lids and dried, and viral titers in the recovered dried spots 2 h after the inoculation were determined.\n",
            " When the CVB4 suspension was spiked in medium containing a low concentration of FCS (<0.05%) or BSA (<0.01 mg mL −1 ) (Fig. 4) , the viral titers in the recovered dried spots were higher at 2.66 and 3.08 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 , respectively. In contrast, the viral titers in the suspension containing 1.25% of FCS and more than 0.39 mg mL −1 of BSA were below the detection limit of the test <0.5 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 . The viral titers in the suspension containing more than 1.25% FCS increased steadily and reached 1.17 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 at 100% FCS (P=0.019 vs the detection limit of the test).\n",
            " The viral titers in the recovered dried spots were lower when CVB4 was spiked in FCS and BSA media than in media containing any concentration of NaCl (Fig. 4) . In media Fig. 3 . Virucidal effect of drying on H1N1, HSV-1, CVB4, and MVM in supernatant fluids applied to Petri dish lids. Ten microliters of each supernatant fluid was applied to Petri dish lids in quadruplicate. They were dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet at room temperature. Ten microliters of sterile distilled water was added to the dried spot before starting a new cycle. Thereafter, dried inocula were recovered using 1 mL of media and the infectious titers were determined and expressed as log 10 . The results are the mean + SD of four independent experiments. The dashed line represents the detection limit of the test. *: P value <0.05. Fig. 4 . Virucidal effect of drying on CVB4 suspensions at various concentrations of FCS, BSA, and NaCl.

Thereafter, dried inocula were recovered using 1 mL of medium and the infectious titers were determined and expressed as log 10 . The results are the mean ± SD of four independent experiments. The dashed line represents the detection limit.\n",
            " containing low concentrations of NaCl from 0 to 0.1 mg mL −1 the viral titers in the recovered dried spots increased slightly from 2.66 to 3.08 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (P=0.1). In contrast, the viral titers in media containing between 0.1 and 2 mg mL −1 NaCl decreased from 3.08 to 2.58 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (P=0.04). In media containing more than 2 mg mL −1 NaCl, the viral titers increased steadily and reached 4.16 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 at 300 mg mL −1 NaCl (P=0.028 vs. viral titers at 2 mg mL −1 NaCl).\n",
            " The efficiency of recovering CVB4 when drops were dried in protein-rich media was analyzed. Viral titers were determined and RNA was extracted to measure the amount of viral RNA by RT real-time PCR. Experiments were performed with CVB4 spiked (1% vol/vol final dilution) in FBS (100%) or water containing 50 mg mL −1 BSA. In both protein-rich media, the amounts of viral RNA in recovered inocula dried for 2 h at room temperature and in undried inocula were similar, as displayed by the pattern of Ct values obtained by RT real-time PCR, whereas the infectious titer values were markedly different (Fig. 5) . Taken together, these results demonstrated that viral particles contained in a protein-rich medium dried on petri dish lids were readily recovered.\n",
            " Several considerations in the present study are noteworthy. The persistence of H1N1, HSV-1, MVM, and CVB4 was investigated and, for the first time, the effects of NaCl, FCS and BSA concentrations on CVB4 persistence were determined. Moreover, the effects of repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension on the persistence of H1N1, HSV-1, MVM and CVB4 were investigated. We selected petri dish lids for two reasons: they are hydrophobic, which prevents spreading of the droplet, and are non-porous, thereby improving virus viability (2) . The efficiency of viral recovery from petri dish lids was confirmed in experiments combining the measurement of infectious titers and estimation of the levels of viral particles through the amount of viral RNA measured by RT real-time PCR.\n",
            " Inactivation under the biosafety cabinet was achieved at different times based on the type of virus being tested. Inactivation curves for H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 encompassed two phases. The first phase lasted 2 h and corres-ponded to rapid decreases in the viral titer of −2.33, −1.1, and −1.5 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 for HSV-1, H1N1, and CVB4, respectively, but not MVM. In the second phase, the viral titers of each virus slowly decreased. Scheuplein and al. reported that the first phase was characterized by water loss due to the evaporation of free water from the surface (14) , which exposes viruses to a liquid-air interface, leading to virus inactivation (18) . Repeated drying followed by resuspension in water was carried out for the first time in the present study. Infectious titers of H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 decreased gradually at each cycle, whereas no significant change was observed in the MVM infectious titer. Within these cycles, each resuspension modified particle positions and allowed for the new exposure of viral particles to the liquid-air interface, which may explain the continuous reductions observed in viral titers with each cycle (14) . CVB4, which persisted for 5 weeks under the biosafety cabinet, was fully inactivated by 4 cycles of iterative drying, while H1N1 persisted for 5 d and remained infectious after 8 cycles. This difference can be explained by rehydration during the resuspension process, which markedly inactivated non-lipid viruses, as reported previously for poliovirus (3) . However, MVM, a non-enveloped virus, was not affected by iterative drying.\n",
            " Enveloped viruses were more sensitive than non-enveloped viruses in the second phase of viral persistence, which started when liquid was no longer observed on the lids; H1N1 and HSV-1 were inactivated in 5 d and 3 d, whereas CVB4 was inactivated in 6 weeks and MVM continued to be infectious. Drying was slower in this phase, which can be explained by the slow process of water loss due to the diffusion and elimination of bound water, as demonstrated previously (14) . It remains to be determined whether the process is still slower in the case of MVM, as reflected by the persistence of this virus in our experiments.\n",
            " A discrepancy was noted between our results and previous findings and was explained by several differences regarding media, surfaces, virus strains and temperature. Bean et al. inactivated H1N1 at a higher temperature (28.3°C vs. 20°C) (2) and Abad et al. inactivated poliovirus, an enterovirus resuspended in PBS, on a latex surface in less than 20 d (1) whereas CVB4 was inactivated in 6 weeks in our experiments.\n",
            " The results of our study show that the initial concentrations of BSA, FCS, and NaCl played a role in the pattern of viabil- , and 50 µL of these suspensions were applied to petri dish lids in quadruplicate. Inocula on lids were dried for 2 h at room temperature, and, thereafter, recovered with 1 mL of culture media. The infectious titers were determined and expressed as log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (■). RNA was extracted and the levels of viral RNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and expressed as C t (□). The results are the mean + SD of four independent experiments. The dashed line represents the detection limit.\n",
            " ity of CVB4 exposed to drying. The infectious titers of CVB4 after drying were higher when the virus was in pure water than in water containing BSA or FCS. These results demonstrated that the resistance of CVB4 to drying was hampered in the presence of BSA or FCS. The survival curves of CVB4 resuspended in 0 to 0.29 mg mL −1 BSA in 0 and 1.25% FCS were similar, which is consistent with the corresponding concentration of BSA in FCS under these conditions (0 and 0.30 mg mL −1 ). Taken together, these results suggest that the lower resistance of CVB4 in the presence of 0 to 1.25% FCS in our experiments depended on albumin. In contrast, with an initial concentration of more than 1.25% FCS, the impact of drying on CVB4 viability was reduced. A previous study reported that higher concentrations of proteins protected viruses against drying (16) ; however, CVB4 exposed to drying was fully inactivated in the presence of high concentrations of BSA (more than 0.39 mg mL −1 ) in the present study. The mechanism underlying the protective effect provided by high concentrations of FCS against drying remains to be determined. At an initial concentration of more than 10 mg L −1 , NaCl protected CVB4 from desiccation. This can be explained by a slow rehydration process during sample recovery, which protected the viral capsid, as previously suggested (3). In contrast, the viability of CVB4 was the lowest at a concentration of 9 mg mL −1 NaCl, which is the average concentration in blood.\n",
            " We herein showed that viruses persisted for days or even weeks on dry hydrophobic surfaces. The pattern of resistance of viruses toward drying, as illustrated in the model of CVB4, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral populations, as suggested by the results of iterative drying. Moreover, media compositions and component concentrations clearly played a role when virus suspensions were exposed to drying. The results of our study suggest that a subsequent increase in solute concentrations in droplets modulated the viability of viruses toward drying. Since the compositions of media play a role in the viability of viruses exposed to drying, the persistence of viruses in natural media (clinical or environmental), instead of defined media, need to be investigated. Further studies will be directed towards this line of investigation in our laboratory.\n",

            "Body Text: A temperature controller (LDC 3724B, ILX Lightwave) was used to control the temperature of a Peltier 1 heater (TES1 12703, Hebei I.T. (Shanghai) Co., Ltd). To implement the PID algorithm, a 10kΩ thermistor as 2 a feedback sensor was placed on the heater surface and connected with the controller circuit. 3 2.3. Nanopore Current Signal Analysis 4 The nanopore current signal was processed by a sensitive current amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Molecular 5 Device) with a low pass filter (cut off frequency of 10KHz) and simultaneously recorded at 250KSa/s 6 sampling rate with a data acquisition module (Digidata 1440A, Molecular Device). The current trace was 7 later analyzed by a custom MATLAB program, which can distinguish translocation events from other ionic 8 current fluctuations and electrical noise. First, the program calculates the standard deviation of the 9 nanopore baseline current and then initializes the program with a user defined detection threshold, which 10 is defined here as 4X the standard deviation of the background ionic current. In each cycle, a cluster of 11 sampled data points are considered collectively to downsample the signal and the mean value of the 12 cluster is considered as the new data point. This new data point is compared with the previously calculated 13 reference data point, and if the difference does not cross the threshold then the reference point is 14 updated with a proportional control algorithm. As soon as the threshold is crossed, the program tags this 15 event as a possible translocation event and then calculates the peak height. When the current falls back 16 below a predefined threshold within a user defined time (~10X longer than the expected translocation 17 dwell time), the program saves the duration between this event and the threshold crossing event as the 18 translocation dwell time, confirming it as a real translocation event. If the threshold is crossed by the 19 nanopore current just because of a random baseline shifting event, the ionic current amplitude remains 20 higher than the predefined threshold value within the user defined time. As a result, the program will 21 discard the event as a timeout event. 22 23 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Synthetic RNA samples including fragments from ORF 1ab, Envelope, and Nucleocapsid region of the 1 SARS-CoV-2 genome were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC: VR-3276SD).

Experimental setup and TACRE implementation 15 Fig. 1a shows a schematic view of the nanopore sensor and the experimental setup. At its heart is an 16 8x8 mm silicon chip on which six layers of alternating SiO2 and Ta2O5 were deposited to enable optical 17 waveguiding in low index layers based on the ARROW principle (Duguay et al. 1986 ). On top of these 18 layers, solid-core (SC) ARROWs (shown in grey) and a 5m x 12m microfluidic channel (shown in blue) 19 that also functions as a liquid-core (LC) ARROW waveguide are defined using SiO2 deposition and a 20 sacrificial layer process (Measor et al. 2011; Yin et al. 2004) . A nanopore with 20 nm diameter was milled 21 with a focused ion beam into the SiO2 layer over the liquid channel right next to the SC-LC interface at the 22 end of the horizontal channel section (see Fig. 1a ). More details of the device fabrication are provided in 23 the Methods section. Three fluid reservoirs were attached at the ends of the liquid channel (#1 and #3) 1 and over the nanopore (#2), respectively. Reservoirs were attached to the device with a thin layer of 2 thermal curing glue. They allow for introduction of liquids and particles into the channel and facilitate the 3 insertion of Ag/AgCl electrodes (each electrode was vertically inserted into each reservoir) to apply an 4 Fig. 1 . Optical trapping assisted nanopore capture rate enhancement (TACRE) platform. a, Optofluidic chip with connected solid-core (SC, gray) and liquid-core (LC, blue) waveguides. Reservoirs are attached over channel outlets and nanopore (NP) location. Voltages VEK and VNP are applied for electrokinetic delivery of bead-bound targets to the nanopore and translocation of released targets through nanopore, respectively. A light beam guided through the LC waveguide traps and collects carrier microbeads at the nanopore location. b, Closeup of TACRE process at NP location: targets are released from the beads while beads are trapped by the optical beam in the fluidic channel. Region (I): targets inside this region at the beginning of the experiment can diffuse to the nanopore capture volume within the duration of the experiment. Region (II): nanopore capture volume for particle translocations. c, SEM image of a terraced micro-well to create thin membrane for ion milling of 20 nm nanopore (inset). d, Baseline-corrected nanopore current for SARS-CoV-2 RNA segments translocating through the pore. Red dots mark individual RNA molecules identified by custom peakfinding algorithm. The optical trapping-assisted capture rate enhancement (TACRE) approach is implemented by delivering 3 microbeads that carry target molecules (here SARS-CoV-2 RNAs) from reservoir 1 into the channel and 4 then optically trapping them directly under the nanopore location. In this way, all targets reside within 5 the high-field capture radius of the nanopore at dramatically increased local concentration (region II in 6 Fig. 1b) and can be drawn rapidly and efficiently through the nanopore upon thermal release. This is in 7 stark contrast to detection of targets from bulk solution, where only a few targets that diffuse from region 8 (I) into the capture volume are detected. In order to reach the attomolar concentration levels found in 9 clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples, the process needs to be efficient in target delivery, trapping at the pore, and 10 target release. For optimized carrier bead delivery to the trapping region, we use a magnet to attract the 11 magnetic carrier beads to the bottom of the reservoir 1, where they can be drawn into the fluidic channel 12 by the electrokinetic force applied via VEK. Electrophoretic transport of beads to the nanopore is faster 13 and more controllable than purely pressure-based flow, and a detailed analysis is given in supplementary 14 section 1. For efficient and simple trapping of the beads at the nanopore, we use a single optical beam to 15 trap the carrier beads under the nanopore. As shown in Fig. 1a , a single-mode fiber is used to couple a 16 laser beam (532nm, Lighthouse Photonics) into the SC-waveguide at the edge of the chip with subsequent 17 propagation in the adjoining section of the LC waveguide. The scattering force of the beam, FO, is the 18 result of momentum transfer from photons that scatter off of the magnetic beads and overcomes the 19 electrokinetic force , FE, and traps the beads against the channel wall. This approach provides a 20 reproducible trapping location and a simplified optical setup compared to dual-beam or tweezer traps. 21\n",
            " Note that the optical force is only present in the horizontal channel section and, therefore, does not affect 22 the continued electrokinetic delivery from reservoir 1 into this region. When a desired number of 23 magnetic beads have been trapped under the nanopore, VEK is turned off and the beads remain 24 immobilized due to the optical trapping force. Third, efficient capture of released target molecules by the 1 nanopore is ensured by simultaneous application of heat on the heating block to release targets from the 2 beads and the nanopore voltage VNP that initiates the sensing process. The absence of a delay between 3 the release and sensing steps minimizes the possibility of target molecules escaping into the diffusion-4 limited region, making larger trapping enhancement factors possible as will be described below. 5\n",
            " Using this approach, molecular targets are presented to and detected by the nanopore in label-free and 6 amplification-free fashion as shown by the representative current trace in Fig. 1d where translocations 7 from individual RNA targets are observed with good signal-to-noise ratio and marked with red dots. Events 8 were identified by a custom threshold algorithm that is described in more detail in the Methods section. 9\n",
            " Before we turn to a detailed discussion of the results using clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples, we address the 10 up-stream assay design that ensures specificity of the nanopore sensor. 11 2.6. SARS-CoV-2 assay design 12 When used as a molecular particle counter, nanopore sensors lack the specificity to reliably identify a 13 particular target. In principle, different molecules produce different current blockade signatures, but in 14 practice the variation in their signals is too large to ensure accurate analysis, especially in complex 15 solutions such as bodily fluids. In order to preserve the label-free detection paradigm, a sample 16 preparation process is required that ensures that the nanopore is only exposed to the target molecules. were functionalized with 14-bp long biotinylated pulldown oligonucleotides specific to the ORF 1ab region 2 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig. 2a) . The specificity of this pulldown sequence to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs was 3 verified by a negative control experiment with Zika virus nucleic acids and showed no false positives 4 (Meena et al. 2021) . A relatively short pulldown sequence was chosen for compatibility with a moderate 5 target release temperature at the nanopore of 35.1 o C. To prepare the beads for the assay, a 5 L aliquot 6 of the beads at stock concentration (4 mg/mL) was washed 3x with pre-filtered 1X T50 (50mM NaCl, 10mM 7\n",
            " Tris, pH 6.5) buffer solution and then 0.5 L of 100 M biotinylated 14-bp pulldown sequence (purchased 8 from IDT) was added with 6x molar excess to saturate the binding sites of each bead. The mixture was 9 then kept on the rotary mixture at room temperature for 1 hour. After the incubation process, unattached 10 pulldown sequences were removed by washing and the magnetic beads were resuspended in 5 L of 1X 11 T50 solution. 12 To detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples, human nasal swab samples that tested 1 negatively for SARS-CoV-2 (confirmed by RT-qPCR) were collected by the UCSC Molecular Diagnostics 2 Laboratory. A 10 L aliquot of each sample was spiked with 10 L of 1x10 9 copies/mL synthesized SARS-3\n",

While the exact extraction efficiency is not known, the results 10 of our concentration dependent assay (see Fig. 3d ) suggest that this process worked with minimal loss. 11\n",
            " Since there are more than 10 5 binding sites on a bead, there is ample room for future optimization of the 12 protocol, e.g for detection of higher concentrations, use of fewer beads for chip-based sample 13 preparation, or to increase the throughput of the nanopore sensing step. To further increase the pulldown 14 efficiency and accelerate annealing, the mixture was transferred to a 30 °C water bath for 1 minute Then 15 the vial was gently flicked and centrifuged briefly, followed by 1-minute heating in a dry bath at 95 °C. The 16 water bath cooling and dry bath heating steps were repeated four times to maximize the binding 17 possibility of the target particles to the magnetic beads. Then the solution was kept in an ice bath for 30 18 minutes. During the final bead washing process, the unattached target RNA molecules and nasal swab 19 supernatant were discarded, followed by washing with 1x T50 buffer twice. The target-carrying magnetic 20 beads (Fig, 2c) were resuspended in 1x T50 buffer with a final concentration of 3.3x10 6 beads/mL. An 21 added 2% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant helps reduce bead clogging inside the LC channel. 22\n",
            " The release temperature is set to 10 °C above the melting temperature between the pulldown sequence 23 and the target (35.1 °C), to account for heat transfer loss from the heater block to the ARROW chip. We 24 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reiterate that this bead based SPE method offers flexibility for adjusting the bead number for 1 measurements at different target concentrations to reach a desired number of targets per bead. Save for 2 the different starting matrix, the same protocol was used for measurements of targets in buffer solution. 3 Fig. 1d already showed the experimentally observed nanopore current traces obtained from the clinical 1 NP swab samples using bead-based SPE and TACRE-based detection from eight trapped beads, 2 demonstrating the feasibility of this approach for label-free, amplification-free diagnostics. In order to 3 quantify the performance of the assay, we ran comparative assays with TACRE and without (i.e. detection 4 from bulk solution), and over a large dynamic concentration range (10 4 -10 9 copies/mL) that exceeds the 5 clinically relevant range of 10 4 -10 6 copies/mL ). First, we assessed the speed of the TACRE-6\n",
            " based assay . Fig 3a shows a plot of real-time particle translocations versus running time for both TACRE 7 and bulk control experiments at concentrations of 10 9 and 2x10 8 copies/mL, respectively. The control data 8 ( Fig. 3a top; blue bars) show stochastic, but continuous detection of small numbers of targets over the 9 entire duration of the 5 min measurement due to the slow, diffusion-limited target delivery to the pore. 10\n",
            " The TACRE experiment shows a qualitatively and quantitatively different picture. Here, 90 beads holding 11 an approximate average of 5 RNAs per bead were trapped at the nanopore. These target RNAs were 12 released within the nanopore capture volume by increasing the temperature to 45 o C for the first 150 sec 13 (indicated by gray bar in Fig. 3a) . After the chip reached the desired temperature (monitored by the 14 nanopore baseline current), we observe a sharp rise in the translocation rate between t=57s and t=63s 15 during which 75% of the total of 677 molecules were drawn through the nanopore and detected. This 16 demonstrates the effectiveness of the TACRE process for a full clinical assay. We note that thermally 17 released targets from the beads remaining in reservoir 1 could not contribute to the translocation events 18 by diffusing to the nanopore capture volume within the duration of the experiment. 19\n",
            " Next, we evaluated the suitability of this assay to cover the entire clinically relevant concentration range 20 for COVID-19 ). Fig. 3b shows the concentration of the control experiment with target RNAs 21 spiked into buffer salt solution. Since this bulk solution test does not require bead pulldown, extraction of 22 targets from nasal swabs was not necessary. We find that the number of translocations during the 360s 23 detection window that represents a reasonable duration for a point of care test depends strongly on the 24 concentration as expected for detection from bulk solution. While direct, label-free detection of single 1\n",
            " RNAs is indeed observed even in this arrangement, the assay has become unreliable at 10 5 copies/mL (2±1 2 counts from three trials) and does not work at all at lower concentrations. Therefore, if we choose 10 3 translocation events with a standard deviation of less than 20% as the minimum number of events to 4 positively identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs, bulk detection has a limit of detection of 1x10 6 5 copies/mL and misses essentially the entire clinical concentration range. In stark contrast, the TACRE 6 process does not suffer from these limitations and we can ensure that a sufficient number of carrier beads 7 deliver at least 10 targets into the nanopore capture volume. Fig. 3c presents the concentration 8 dependence of the TACRE assay. The solid circle marks the number of translocations (i.e. SARS-CoV-2 RNAs 9 detected by the nanopore) for the clinical swab sample (c=5x10 8 copies/mL). In this case, eight beads with 10 an average 100 targets per bead were trapped and the measured number of detected RNAs is in excellent 11 agreement with expectations (cross symbol). Another trial, with targets spiked into the same buffer 12 solution that was used for the bulk experiments at a similar starting concentration (1x10 9 copies/mL), 13 shows a very similar count (open circle) and again excellent agreement with the anticipated value. Clearly, 14 the starting matrix (swab vs buffer) does not affect the outcome of the assay, and the remainder of the 15 concentration series was carried out with RNA targets in buffer, analogous to the bulk series. We find that 16 at least ten counts are observed for all concentrations down to the lower clinical limit of 10 4 copies/mL 17 and that there is always good agreement between experiment and the number of counts predicted by 18 multiplying the number of trapped microbeads with the average number of targets attached to each bead. 19\n",
            " This demonstrates unequivocally label-free and amplification-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs over the 20 entire clinically relevant range. We emphasize that a linear dependence is not expected for this plot 21 because the number of trapped beads and the average number of targets per bead varied between data 22\n",
            " points. On the other hand, given the agreement between data and predictions, it is possible to determine 23 an unknown concentration from these data, i.e. from the number of translocations, number of trapped 1 beads, and the concentration of magnetic beads used for extracting the targets. 2\n",
            " In order to further clarify the favorable scaling of the TACRE method with concentration, we present 3 normalized values of the detected counts as solid circles in Fig. 3d . The normalization is based on a 4 standard trial of 10 trapped beads with 20 RNAs/bead, which would result in 200 counts independent of 5 starting concentration and is represented by the solid black line. For example, if only 5 beads were trapped 6 with 8 RNAs/bead, the observed count number would be multiplied by a factor of (10/5)*(20/8)=5 to 7 obtain the normalized value. We find that these normalized values are close to 200 (within a factor of 8 two) across the entire concentration range, which confirms that the TACRE assay is not limited at low 9 concentrations in the same way as a bulk experiment. Indeed, the normalized counts at the lowest and 10 highest concentration (167 and 225, respectively) are nearly identical to each other and the ideal value of 11\n",
            " 200. This shows that the capture process during the sample preparation phase was equally efficient at all 12 concentrations and validates our earlier RNA-per-bead estimates. We can also conclude that the assay 13 can readily be extended to even lower concentrations by increasing the number of trapped beads and/or 14 mixing fewer capture beads with the sample to increase the number of targets per bead. 15 We now turn our attention to quantifying the benefits of the TACRE process in terms of the increased 16 local concentration within the nanopore capture volume which is critical for reaching clinically relevant 17 concentration levels as described above. To quantify the local target concentration near the nanopore 18 during the TACRE experiments with SARS-CoV-2 RNAs, the capture volume is estimated from the bulk 19 experiment as described in more detail in supplementary section 4. Using the calculated value of 1,309 20 m 3 , the local target concentration for both the bulk control (solid blue line) and TACRE (red circles) assays 21 of Fig. 3c is plotted versus starting concentration in Fig. 4a . The bulk control curve shows a trivial linear 22 dependence as the concentration at the nanopore is the same as in the rest of the channel. In the case of 23 the TACRE assay, however, we observe local target concentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than the bulk value and can be maintained at picomolar levels even for initial concentrations in the 1 attomolar range. This demonstrates that the TACRE approach is very efficient, even for a relatively small 2 number of trapped carrier beads, and scales favorably to low concentrations. Indeed, the largest local 3 concentration enhancement of a factor of 7.8x10 5 was observed for the lowest initial target concentration 4 of 17aM. 5\n",
            " Finally, we take a look at the improvements to the assay dynamics, i.e. the increase in assay detection 6 speed enabled by the TACRE approach. To quantify this important benefit, we define a translocation rate 7 enhancement as the ratio of peak translocation rate at each concentration of the TACRE assay and the 8 rate of particle counts over the 360 s duration of the assay for the control case. Fig. 4b shows the 9 Again, we find that the TACRE process becomes more powerful as the concentration decreases, and a 4 record enhancement factor of 2,075x is observed at 1X10 5 copies/mL. This corresponds to an over 2,000 5 times reduction in the time needed to detect the same number of target molecules. Since no targets were 6 detected in the control experiment at 10 4 copies/mL, the TACRE factor would nominally be infinite. With 7 long enough assay times, the control experiment would produce counts and a finite enhancement factor, 8 but it is safe to assume that this factor would significantly exceed the demonstrated value of 2,075x. 9\n",
            " In summary, we have demonstrated a label-free and amplification-free assay for detection of SARS-CoV-11 2 RNAs in clinical samples on a nanopore-optofluidic chip. The use of target delivery to the nanopore via 12 optical trapping of carrier microbeads at the pore solved the major issues of specificity and low detection 13 rates commonly faced by nanopore sensors. The TACRE assay showed vastly superior performance over 14 bulk solution-based analysis in terms of limit of detection, dynamic range, and detection speed with an 15 improvement by more than three orders of magnitude. The assay was demonstrated with clinical 16 nasopharyngeal swab samples and showed a dynamic range of 5 logs, covering the entire clinically 17 relevant concentration range down to a concentration of 17aM. The assay can be readily applied to 18 detection of other infectious diseases that have comparable dynamic ranges (de Laval et al. 2017; Kuypers 19 et al. 2006; Towner et al. 2004 ). It can also be improved, e.g. by increasing the number of trapped beads 20 and their target loads, modifying the trapping process, or optimizing the target release method. These 21 modifications can lead to even larger enhancement factors and lower limits of detection. Furthermore, 22\n",
            " the TACRE assay can be functionally expanded, e.g. by applying the assay to protein targets (Meena et al.  23  1 channel, multiplex detection, or by applying advanced signal processing for real-time analysis of the 2 nanopore signals. As a result, this integrated nanopore sensor has the potential to be used as a simple, 3 ultrasensitive, and rapid molecular analysis tool with a diverse range of applications in disease diagnostics 4 and biomedicine. 5 \n",

            " Emergency systems development is a foundational part of developing emergency care in Africa.\n",

            " Defining key metrics used concurrently throughout African emergency care research is important to facilitate future research.\n",
            " Emergency medicine plays an integral role in many health systems around the world, primarily in high-income countries. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] There is mounting evidence that high-quality emergency care has the potential to address a significant proportion of the global burden of disease, as advocates have called for the development of emergency care in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Recent outbreaks of pandemic infectious diseases such as MERS-CoV in the Middle East and Asia, and Ebola in West Africa highlighted the need for equipped emergency care facilities, staffed with trained personnel to stem the tide of such outbreaks and to form the front lines in the treatment of more common but increasingly important conditions such as non-communicable disease (NCDs) and injuries in LMICs. 17 Despite the compelling need for more data on emergency care in LMICs, research in this area has been largely neglected. A 2015 systematic review of emergency facilities in LMICs found no published reports on emergency care in over half of LMICs. 18 Where data were available, the review found that only a small set of metrics on emergency care delivery was reported consistently across facilities, and that researchers frequently used a wide array of ill-defined measures to describe EC characteristics and performance. This inconsistency has complicated inter-facility data comparison and study replication. 16, 19 More data are needed to understand current capabilities, expose deficits, and ultimately improve emergency care delivery in these resource-constrained settings. 10, 16, [18] [19] [20] In this study, we identify a set of key metrics commonly used by researchers to describe emergency care in LMICs and propose a standard set of data elements that would be practical to collect. A consensus on basic terminology and methodology has advanced the field of emergency medicine in high-income countries, and a clearly defined core set of metrics for describing emergency care in LMICs would similarly not only advance local emergency care research and quality improvement, but also allow for more effective cross pollination and systems development.\n",
            " We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO registry: CRD42014007617) to identify published reports describing general emergency care delivered to an undifferentiated patient population in all 139 LMICs. For each LMIC, we searched PubMed, CINAHL, and all World Health Organization (WHO) regional indices using ''[country name] + emerg * \" as the search term. We performed a similar search on Google Scholar, but limited the search to within article titles given the large number of results. We also manually screened select non-indexed journals known to frequently publish research on emergency care. Reference lists of all studies included were further screened manually.\n",
            " Results were screened by title and abstract, and selected for inclusion if they described facility-based emergency care provided to all patients, regardless of disease category or chief complaint. Articles published after 1989 in all languages were included provided an English or French abstract was available. We excluded studies focussed only on specific emergent conditions (e.g., stroke only), subsets of the general emergency patient population (e.g., women only), or data aggregated from multiple departments or facilities, unless they provided general emergency facility statistics or data on the burden of diseases.\n",
            " We evaluated the reporting frequency of data elements commonly found in published emergency care literature originating from LMICs. We created a database that continually expanded with new data fields as the systematic review progressed and new reported metrics were encountered. At the conclusion of the review, we selected publications that provided comprehensive descriptions of their facilities and patients, and used them as models to structure our recommendations for future research.\n",
            " At the conclusion of our review, we presented our findings at the African Federation of Emergency Medicine consensus conferences, Addis Ababa 2014 and Cape Town 2015. Small group discussion amongst attendees provided invaluable insight into some of the local determinants and limitations to data collection and publication in certain settings. We incorporated lessons learnt from the group discussions on how to improve data standards into our recommendations. We highlight specific information to be recorded and reported by individual emergency facilities, to enable reliable inter-facility data comparisons and expose areas for improvement in specific locales. Fig. 3 presents the proportion of these publications that reported the data elements of interest.\n",
            " As a whole, hospital characteristics were nearly universally reported, with the exception of whether it was located in an urban or rural setting. As a result, researchers curious as to the kinds of patients the facility served or its geographic access would have to use mapping software (e.g., Google Maps) to find an approximate location for the facility. Similarly, indicators of overall hospital size and patient capacity, such as the number of inpatient beds, were infrequently reported; however, could be found occasionally on the hospital webpage, if one existed. The physical layout of the emergency centre itself, including the number of emergency centre beds, was documented more often. The annual patient volume in the emergency centre was the most commonly reported marker for facility size, but the simultaneous reporting of the catchment area for the hospital or the number of outpatient visits per year was rare.\n",
            " Although half of the studies referenced the availability of triage, further details on the processes for stratification of patient acuity were not routinely provided. For example, only 20% described the level of training of the healthcare provider performing the triage assessment and even less frequently the protocol used, if any. The level of training for the physicians staffing the EC was reported in only half of the publications, and less so for nurse staffing.\n",
            " Approximately one-fifth of publications were general facility descriptions, without individual emergency facility patient sampling. When patient-level data for those study subjects presenting for emergency care were utilised, 27% were prospective observational or cross-sectional studies and 73% retrospective studies. Continuous sampling was the most commonly used method to gather data on study subjects. But overall, when employing other sampling methods, there was lack of clarity and detail in the study methods to explain the procedures used to ensure adequate selection of a representative study sample.\n",
            " The emergency patient population was defined as paediatric, adult, or general in 90% of reports, 33% reported median or average age for patients, and 63% the proportion of either sex. Fig. 4 shows the frequency of chosen paediatric to adult age cut-offs used by facilities in our review. While the median age was 15 (IQR 14-18), the range was wide from 5 (4 studies in 3 countries) 21-24 to 20 years of age (1 study in 1 country). 25 Patient outcomes of emergency care, which would serve as a marker for the standard of acute care delivery at each facility, were poorly reported limiting the reader's ability to draw accurate conclusions from the published reports. Perhaps the most objective and useful metrics for emergency care-mortality rates at specific time interval, such as 24-h or 48-h mortality-were only available in 10% of publications.\n",
            " The recording of diagnoses was hallmarked by the same lack of consistency as the data describing emergency care. Only 10% of reports used specific diagnosis coding systems, such as ICD-10 Clinical Classification Software. Frequent misclassification, inconsistent, or double classification of conditions can result in over-or underestimation of key conditions. Table 1 lists examples of inconsistencies in the categorisation of various diagnoses and causes of death. Articles commonly classified localized infections with their respective organ system-but also included a separate infectious disease category, presumably for systemic infections (e.g., meningitis and cerebral malaria categorised with the central nervous system, while malaria, tetanus, septicaemia and enteric fever with ''various infections\"). 26 Similarly, traumatic conditions could be cate- gorised with the organ system affected and with a general trauma category.\n",
            " Our review uncovered considerable heterogeneity in reporting practices for studies of emergency care in LMICs. As a result, these research efforts, despite presenting valuable statistics and important healthcare metrics, had limited utility when comparing emergency care delivery and outcomes across different settings and determining trends in time.\n",
            " Specific deficiencies were identified in data elements that required obtaining data from other departments. For example, inpatient beds (10%) and total outpatient visits per year (5%) were underreported. Metrics obtained directly from within the footprint of the EC were reported more reliably, for example annual EC patient volume (90%) was consistently reported as a measure of EC capacity. Similarly, patient events that occur outside the EC are infrequently reported in publications of emergency care in LMICs. Rates of 48 h mortality (10%) and need for subspecialty care (10%) had low-rates of reporting possibly because they do not occur within the patient's EC stay, while data such as type of population served (90%) and gender (63%) are both readily obtained during the EC stay itself and thus more frequently reported. It is instructive to note that studies were 3-4Â as likely to report important metrics like patient mortality in the EC, compared to reporting that required follow up of patients after disposition to the inpatient service. This may be the result of weaknesses in hospital-wide health information systems in most facilities in LMICs, resulting in inability to consistently capture data on these events as part of the emergency care data recorded. Finally, the rate of patients ''brought-in-dead\" was only reported 7% of the time-this complicates interpretation of in-EC mortality rates, since some hospitals may report these patients as having died in the EC. This raises questions regarding the consistency of definitions used for these categories and the lack of transparency in the practices regarding reporting mortality statistics in these facilities.\n",
            " Several important functions of emergency care were also underreported in the studies we reviewed, complicating interpretation of data and its use for future research. First, patient triage is an indispensable first step to high quality emergency care; yet, it was only referenced in approximately one quarter of reports from LMICs. Even fewer publications provided details on triage processes, which are likely to be variable 33,34 ; indeed, several studies have demonstrated a significant improvement in patient outcomes after the implementation of structured triage. 21, 22, 35 Second, the training level for physicians staffing the facility was noted in approximately half of reports. Lack of senior level supervision of physicians in training has been linked to worse patient outcomes, [36] [37] [38] Reporting the level of training of physicians and nurses staffing facilities in LMICs is essential to understanding the capabilities to provide various services and for accurately mapping the human resource gaps. 39 Other statistics reported in the literature used non-uniform parameters, which made it difficult to aggregate data across facilities. For example, the reporting of in-EC mortality rate was the most frequent measure of death; however, the majority of studies failed to also report patient lengths of stay. When lengths of stays were available, the atypical ranges -up to 117 days in a facility in Brazil 40 -and failure to report means and medians for the data made it difficult to compare emergency care across facilities. This heterogeneity in reporting such a critical data element reinforces the importance of having a standard metric for death, such as 24-h mortality.\n",
            " Likewise, length of stay data were often reported with respect to specific and varying time intervals (e.g., >24 h), rather than averages, complicating comparative analyses. [40] [41] [42] Paediatric-adult age cut-offs chosen by individual facilities also varied widely (Fig. 1) . This distorted the appropriate classification of these patient groups across different studies and made it difficult to assess the key differences in patient characteristics, their burden of disease, and clinical outcomes.\n",
            " In addition, there was also discrepancy in reporting burden of disease information. Traumatic and infectious conditions were variably reported with their respective organ systems, i.e., pneumonia categorised with pulmonary disease, or they were grouped together under a broad infectious disease category. This inconsistency in disease categorisation even occurred within a single publication (Table 1) . Ideally, having all infectious and traumatic conditions grouped together as standard practice would allow for an accurate understanding of the true burden of disease.\n",
            " In order to help guide emergency care clinicians and researchers in LMICs, we present a template for manuscript preparation that provides recommendations for how data can be collected, analysed, and reported in a standardised fashion. Consistent research practices across different emergency care settings would maximise the utility of gathered information and allow for more meaningful conclusions to be drawn from aggregated comparable data that could not be gathered in as large a volume from one facility. Furthermore, the ability to aggregate data and to generalise results will make emergency care research in LMICs more useful to other emergency care practitioners who will more confidently be able to assess the ability to translate research findings into their own clinical setting. Table 2 provides a set of recommendations that stemmed from our systematic review. A publication template can also be found in the Online supplement. Insights from small group discussions at the African Federation of Emergency Medicine consensus conferences have also been incorporated into these recommendations.\n",
            " In conclusion, the data elements needed to provide an accurate understanding of the current state of emergency care in LMICs are not being routinely captured. The information that is collected is confounded by dissimilar practices for data acquisition and reporting. Many LMICs lack designated emergency centres altogether, and therefore the ability to accurately describe emergent patient presentations and the acute care delivered is lost. Researchers are bound by the constraints of previously collected administrative data, and lack the tools to initiate prospective data collection in order to answer clinical questions regarding the emergent and life-saving care they provide for their patients. Our goals are to increase the scope of publications from LMICs; facilitate data collection and analysis; improve the ability to translate findings of LMIC emergency care research to other similar settings; gain a better understanding of the burden of disease; and potentially improve patient outcomes by reducing the barriers to clinical research. To do so, we provide a framework for reporting results of emergency care research that is simple to use and which has been tailored to resource-constrained settings in LMICs.\n",

Such shared methodology will result in a rapidly growing body of literature capable of painting a clearer picture of the current state of emergency care to inform policymaker decisions. We urge all emergency care researchers in LMICs to adopt such practices to facilitate the growth of such collaborations to help produce the evidence needed to combat the growing global burden of emergency conditions. Our review aimed to identify all published emergency care literature originating from LMICs; however, our search strategy may have neglected reports that used alternative terminology to signify acute care medicine delivery without using the word stem 'emerg-' in the title, keywords, or abstract of articles. The overall paucity of studies that met our inclusion criteria remains our biggest limitation. Our goal during data collection was to record all reported data elements, but the overall infrequency of reporting outside of a few metrics, such as patient volume and demographics, limited the power to draw accurate conclusions from our results. We also acknowledge that the limited data available to researchers, likely related to the overall use of retrospective data collection relying on existing administrative records, is an overarching limitation to this research process, and one that our recommendations aim to change.\n",

            " The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 1 to 14 days, with a mean of 5 to 6 days. The first studies indicated that the viral load persisted up to 8 days after the onset of symptoms in mild cases and peaked in day 11 in more severe cases 4, 5 .

In fact, 69.8% of the patients that tested negative twice needed more than 20 days to achieve the first negative test. Moreover, 34% of patients that kept RT-PCR tests positive at the end of our study, tested positive for 40 days. These results may indicate that in a situation of lack of testing resources, patients might be re-tested only after the 20th day from the first positive test and beyond.\n",

It is important to emphasize that RT-PCR does not evaluate the infectious capacity of the detected RNA. In fact, no live virus was isolated from sample cultures obtained 8 days after the onset of symptoms 5, 14 . Therefore, the persistence of viral RNA may not be associated with disease severity but may indicate that the immune response is unable to promote the virus RNA clearance.\n",

Although increased titers of specific antibody may induce the expression of pro-inflammatory factors they also contribute to the inactivation and clearance of virus 12,15-17 . Our study evidenced that patients discharged home were younger, had mild disease, presented low IgG titer and maintained viral RNA for a longer period of time. On the other hand, patients in the inpatient group were older, moderately to severely ill, presented a higher titer of IgG and had a better capability to achieve viral RNA clearance.\n",
            " Since mild illness is associated with a low viral load 4, 18, 19 , we hypothesize that the exposition of patients discharged home to SARS-CoV-2 did not elicit an effective immune response, explaining the milder disease and the need of more time to viral RNA clearance.\n",
            " The lack of information regarding persistence of virus RNA and infectivity, disease severity and immune response, supports the current guidance of viral clearance confirmation prior to patient transference out of dedicated COVID-19 wards and of ending isolation in mild illness patients.\n",
            " In conclusion, our study highlights that viral RNA may persist for a long period of time in respiratory samples; mild illness patients present a weak immune response; viral RNA may remain even after the rise of IgG titer; and persistence of viral RNA is not necessarily associated with severe disease but may result from a weaker immune response instead. Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation, (minimum -maximum). There was a significant difference between the mean number of days to achieve the first negative test in the inpatients and in the patients discharged home, P=0.027.

            "Body Text: The oCVD reactor is an enclosed sealed chamber that maintains conditions to allow for vapor phase polymerization of PEDOT, monomers are stored in a glass holding chamber that is then heated via a thermal heating jacket to the vaporization temperature of the monomer. The monomer is then introduced via a valve system that controls the rate of vapor introduction into the chamber. The oxidizing agent is stored in a crucible in the main chamber that is heated to the agent's sublimation temperature during the deposition process. Substrates are held in an upsidedown holder that contains a heater and a rotational motor. Chamber vacuum pressure is monitored using low and high vacuum gauges. Synthesis of PEDOT thin films was done through the reaction of commercially available liquid EDOT and powdered iron (III) chloride (FeCl3). Deposition pressures of 2×10 -3 Torr were achieved through the use of a combined roughing and turbo pumping system. EDOT monomer was introduced into the chamber using a needle valve after being heated to 130 °C to vaporize. FeCl3 oxidizing agent was introduced after the powder was sublimated from a crucible via slow controlled heating to 180 °C at a ramping rate of approximately 10 °C per minute. Once both the vaporized monomer and oxidizing agent were introduced into the chamber the heated substrates were uncovered through the use of a shutter system and were kept at a rotation speed of 5 rpm throughout deposition to result in uniform and homogeneous PEDOT films. The deposition temperature effect on the conductivity of oCVD PEDOT was investigated by growing the polymer film on a glass substrate. The use of glass substrates instead of the fabrics is to objectively measure the conductivity of oCVD PEDOT films on typical substrates (i.e., flat non-conductive substrates) and also to exclude the thermal degradation of the fabrics during the oCVD process. The relation between temperature (T) and conductivity (σ) was plotted as a log(σ)\n",
            " vs. log(T) as shown in Fig. S2 . The log(σ) linearly increased with increasing the temperature.\n",
            " Above the certain critical point (100 °C), the slope became slightly gentle but still steadily increased with the temperature. Fig. S3 , the peak at around 1520 cm -1 , representing C=C stretching mode, tends to intensify with increasing substrate temperature. It is well known that the areal intensity of the C=C stretch peak is regarded as a valuable indicator to compare conjugation lengths as well as doping levels of PEDOT; the stronger peak is attributed to the longer conjugation length (30) (31) (32) . Therefore, our FTIR results prove that a high-temperature surrounding facilitates the chain growth during the oCVD vapor-phase polymerization. Notably, the peak was intensified by raising the substrate temperature from 323 K to 343 K, whereas a lack of change was observed at higher temperatures. Thus, we can conclude that the conjugation and doping level of oCVD PEDOT is a strong function of the deposition temperature, and reaches a maximum level of conjugation and doping at a certain temperature, which is ~343 K. The temperature-dependent 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600\n",

            " doping level is supported by our previous reports (30, 32) that experimentally verified the high carrier concentrations in oCVD PEDOT through Hall effect measurements, of which the carrier density increases with increasing substrate temperature and the density reaches the theoretical maximum carrier density (~2×10 21 cm -3 ) at a substrate temperature of 70 °C or higher. Therefore, the conductivity trend conversion in Fig. S2 is likely attributed to the dependency of the doping level on the substrate temperature. The crystallinity of polymer films is another significant factor dominating the charge transport property of PEDOT. We previously reported that resulting oCVD PEDOT films are in the nanocrystalline state (30) . Herein, to investigate the crystalline grain size depending on the deposition temperature, the surface topological information of the PEDOT was analyzed using atomic force microscope (AFM), as shown in Fig. S4 . The film roughness was gradually increased from 1.44 to 4.69 nm by raising the deposition temperature from 50 to 130 °C, implying that the size of the grain-like structures of the film could be enlarged under a high-temperature condition.\n",
            " The larger grain size obtained at higher substrate temperatures may enhance the charge carrier transport, which contributes to the increase in conductivity of oCVD PEDOT with substrate temperature. In addition to the enhanced conjugation and doping level in oCVD PEDOT with increasing substrate temperature (Fig. S3) , the correlation between the grain size and the substrate temperate supports the conductivity results where higher substrate temperatures result in higher conductivity of oCVD PEDOT (30, 31) . To identify the origin of the sharp current drops in more detail, the sensor was tested with and without covering a polyester (PE) fabric on the PEDOT face, and the results were added to and non-pressured state, decreased more than five times using the PE cap.\n",
            " It is well known that glass is positively charged when contacted with other materials due to a typical triboelectric effect (33) . The initial glass/PEDOT contact accompanies positive and negative charge generation on the glass and PEDOT, respectively. The generated transitory charge creates a triboelectric voltage across the PEDOT/glass interface, resulting in a signal interference representing the current drop. In general, the triboelectric phenomenon takes place in a short moment (< 10 ms) and rapidly reaches an equilibrium state. Therefore, as shown in Fig. S8 , the sensing response (current variation, recorded at the equilibrium state) was not significantly disturbed by the triboelectric effect. In the same manner, when we employ the sensor to monitor a blood pressure pattern from the wrist or neck, the triboelectric effect only occurs at the initial moment of touching the sensor on the body and disappears within several milliseconds; thus, a current change caused by blood pressure could be solely extracted. To analyze the sustainability of our PEDOT fabric sensor against standard use as well as abrasion, the current change was measured against cycles of general use and intentional rubbing.\n",
            " In Fig. S9A , the change in current from initial measurements (∆I/I0) was measured across 200 cycles of standard use, where the sensor was pressed against the skin, then the current was measured after removal to see if the repeated contact had any degrading effect on the resistance of the PEDOT film deposited on the fabrics. In Fig. S9B , the ∆I/I0 was again measured across 200 cycles of abrasion against human skin. In this experiment, the sensor was rubbed against human skin unidirectional for approximately 25mm. After removal from skin, current was measured with a voltage of 0.1V across each sensor, then reported at five cycle increments. Fig. S9A and B\n",
            " demonstrate that oCVD PEDOT deposited on fabric have good sustainability against both standard use and abrasion, where the ability to transfer current through the film was maintained and no signs of degradation due to repeated use or abrasion occurred. The outermost non-woven facet among the three layers in a disposable mask was mainly covered by the oCVD PEDOT, while a discontinuous (hence highly resistive) PEDOT film was formulated on the middle fabric (Fig. S10A ). In addition, the deposition of PEDOT was not observed in the innermost fabric due to the masking effect of the upper layers. Therefore, it is expected that the majority of current flows in the outer fabric. As such, we only utilized that outermost layer for investigating the working mechanism. Herein, we develop a mathematical protocol to correct a baseline shift and estimate an accurate respiratory rate in real-time. As shown in the raw data (Fig. S11A) , the currents representing inhalation and exhalation states were fluctuated due to inconsistent tidal volume for each breath, and noise from the minute movement of the subject. To correct the undesired shifts, the results were differentiated with the time domain (Fig. S11B ). This process serves as a role to correct the baseline to be zero so that a current deviation caused by breath is selectively extracted. The next step is the Fourier transformation to convert the time-scale data to a frequency domain.\n",
            " Randomly released electrical noise or other possible errors derived by a human motion could be ignored in a specific frequency range of 0-1 Hz which contains respiratory pattern information (Fig. S11C) . Therefore, as a consequence of the overall data processing series, precise respiratory rates were successfully estimated (16.2 and 40.2 min-1 for before and after running, respectively) as shown in Fig. S11C . It should be noted that the mathematical data processing renders quantitative analysis for respiratory rate even if uncontrollable variables from the environmental or human-dependent conditions affect the signal, thus ensuring reproducible data extraction. The thickness of the PEDOT film was measured through the common technique of measuring thickness of a reference sample (PEDOT on Silicon substrate) using an ellipsometer, that was deposited concomitantly. This technique is a well-documented method to examine thin film thickness information on substrates where direct measurement is difficult, but where a reference thickness sample on silicon can be measured with either an ellipsometer or profilometer (55, 56) . Therefore, the thickness of the PEDOT film on fabric in the study is mentioned as the nominal thickness, as the true thickness measurement was measured on the silicon sample. To verify this technique, we have conducted additional measurements where cross-sectional images of PEDOT films deposited on fabric were measured via SEM and compared to ellipsometer measured reference samples deposited concomitantly with the fabric samples. The silicon reference sample measured with the ellipsometer reported a thickness 237 nm. SEM crosssectional images of PEDOT films deposited on nylon fabric were obtained utilizing a Thermo Fischer Scientific Teneo. From the SEM images (Fig. S12) , thickness information was measured along with multiple film locations, where the average film thickness was approximately 230 nm, showing less than 5% error between the SEM cross-sectional image and ellipsometer measurements of the silicon reference sample deposited concomitantly. This shows the validity of the reference sample technique in measuring sample thicknesses where direct thickness measuring is difficult.\n",

            "Body Text: Seasonal influenza viruses circulate year-round throughout the world, typically peaking in the winter in each hemisphere. However, since the first report of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the virus, influenza activity has remained low, with laboratory-confirmed outbreaks globally nonexistent during the influenza seasons [1] [2] [3] . In Northern Hemisphere countries, data from respiratory surveillance systems in China, England, and the United States indicated a 92.4%-99.9% decrease in the past five years on average in the 2020-2021 season [4] [5] [6] . In the Southern Hemisphere, where cold seasons are opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere, influenza has also remained scarce for two consecutive influenza seasons [7, 8] .\n",
            " Influenza's global plummeting adds great uncertainty on preparedness for the incoming influenza circulations through a targeted vaccination program [1] [2] [3] , calling for thorough investigation of the causes. Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and interventions have been associated with this decline [7, 9] , how each individual NPI and SARS-CoV-2 interference contributes to long-term influenza decline remains elusive. Face-masking in public spaces, mobility change (e.g., international travel and domestic movement mitigations), and physical distancing have been found to be highly effective in reducing respiratory infections in laboratory and clinical contexts [10, 11] and by simulation models [12] . Furthermore, data have shown that the transmission of the influenza virus was interrupted by a seasonal rhinovirus epidemic [13] , but one virus's circulation may also be boosted by that of another virus [14, 15] , leading to the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 interference being largely unclear.\n",
            " However, in the context of seasonal influenza, unraveling the roles of highly correlated NPIs is challenging even without considering SARS-CoV-2 interference. Cross-country modeling, which is widely used for assessing the individual effects of NPIs on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, is not applicable to seasonal influenza [16] owing to the high variation in viral antigenic evolutions, climate conditions, sociodemographic features, influenza circulation strains and subtypes, as well as influenza vaccination coverage across countries [17, 18] . Here, we developed a country-specific inference model to estimate the individual effects of NPIs and SARS-CoV-2 interference. Our approach relies on long-term influenza surveillance data and mobility change and identifies the individual effects through a contrast of potential influenza activities under alternative hypothetical scenarios [19] . We assessed the short-term effects of a one-week increase in NPIs (denoted by percent reduction (%) in percent positivity), as well as the long-term effects of NPIs and SARS-CoV-2 interference in influenza seasons (denoted by absolute reduction in percent positivity).\n",
            " We collected data on influenza, mobility (international and domestic), and mask-wearing interventions from public sources in China, England, and the United States. All data were obtained from public sources and are summarized in Table S1 in Appendix A. We note that changes in domestic mobility during the COVID-19 period may reflect several highly correlated mobility-related NPIs, including movement restriction and physical distancing (Supplementary methods and Table S2 in Appendix A). As clinical influenza visits may be affected by NPIs [18] , we used the percent positivity tests reported from laboratory surveillance data as a measure of influenza activity. We considered northern China and southern China separately because of the sharp differences in their patterns of seasonal influenza [9] . In northern China, England, and the United States, the influenza season lasts for 16-20 weeks (northern China, Weeks 49-14; England, Weeks 50-13; the United States, Weeks 48-15), whereas in southern China, the influenza season is much longer (23 weeks, Weeks 45-15).\n",
            " The virological data from 2011 to 2021 were obtained from the corresponding government websites, Chinese National Influenza Center [4] , Public Health England [6] , and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5] . The Chinese National Influenza Surveillance Network system monitors influenza viruses circulating in China and consists of 554 sentinel hospitals and 407 network laboratories located in over 300 cities in the mainland of China. The Respiratory DataMart System in Public Health England serves to systematically monitor influenza and other respiratory viruses circulating in England, with weekly viral test results reported by 14 laboratories representing all nine regions of England. Surveillance of the influenza virus in the United States is monitored through the United States influenza surveillance system and collated by the CDC and over 400 public health and clinical laboratories located throughout all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia. Weekly virological data, including the percentage of respiratory specimens that tested positive for influenza, were released on the respective government influenza surveillance website. The weekly percent positivity is shown in Fig. S1 in Appendix A.\n",
            " As in the literature [9] , the start of an influenza epidemic period is defined as the first week starting from which the percent positivity stays above 10 for at least two weeks, and the end is defined as the last week after which the percent positivity drops below 10 for at least three consecutive weeks. Influenza activity typically peaks in the winter season for northern China, England, and the United States, while in southern China, it may also be active in summer. The influenza season represents the common period of the nine influenza epidemics from 2011 to 2020. The start and end of the influenza season were defined as the medians of the start and end of the nine influenza epidemics, respectively.\n",
            " We used normalized international inbound travel volume to measure international mobility in the four areas. Inbound travel in the United Kingdom (UK) was obtained from the Department for Transport [41] in 2011-2021 and is used to represent inbound travel in England. Inbound travel in northern and southern China during 2011-2021 is represented by the monthly inbound travel in Shanghai released by the Shanghai Bureau of Statistics [42] . Data on inbound travel in the United States were collected from the US Department of Transportation [43, 44] in 2011-2021. Weekly mobility was estimated using the moving average over the past weeks to account for the delay between mobility changes and laboratory testing and reporting [45] . At baseline, we assume that = 2 in England and the United States and = 4 in northern and southern China to account for a longer delay in China. We conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis on the delay . In normalization, since mobility increases with a steady yearly trend while influenza activity evolves with a highly irregular interannual pattern due to differences in circulating strains [46] , we scaled down the weekly mobility using the average value in the first month for each year separately.\n",
            " We collected domestic mobility data in northern and southern China through the Gaode Map [47] in 2019-2021, which provides daily relative inflow of smartphone users for each city covered by the Chinese National Influenza Surveillance Network. The daily inflow was aggregated into the week level using the moving average method, as described above. The inflow in 2019-2020 is directly projected into 2011-2018 without adjustment because the yearly trend is removed in the analysis. Domestic mobility in England and the United States was estimated by relying on transportation data in the UK and the United States, respectively. We collected the monthly released domestic transportation data in the UK from the Office for National Statistics [48] and in the United States from the US Department of Transportation [43, 49] . If monthly data were not available, we estimated the monthly mobility flow by equally allocating quarterly flow data to each month. In England, since monthly pedal data were only available for 2020, we estimated domestic mobility in 2020 as the average of vehicle and pedal flows. We estimated weekly domestic mobility in England and the United States using the same moving average and normalization methods. The mobility data are summarized in Table S3 in Appendix A. International and domestic mobility are presented in Fig. S2 in Appendix A.\n",
            " We collected data on mask-wearing interventions from the start of SARS-CoV-2 transmission until Week 28, 2021. In China, the mask-wearing order was imposed starting from Week 4 of 2020 (January 23, obtained from Ref. [50] ) until the end week, Week 28 of 2021. For England, the mask-wearing regulation was made from Week 30 of 2020 (July 23) until Week 28 of 2021 (July 19) [51] . We denoted the mask-wearing index as 1 during the implementation period and 0 otherwise. The US CDC imposed the mask-wearing order from Week 14 of 2020 until the end week, with a short-term lift during Week 22 of 2021 to Week 29 of 2021 for fully COVID-19 vaccinated people in non-healthcare settings [52] . We estimated the degree of mask-wearing as the proportion of the number of states that imposed the mask-wearing order during the period of CDC mask-wearing recommendations because state governments did not simultaneously comply with the order imposed by the CDC. We referred to the data here as the mask index, which is adjusted by the vaccination data ( Fig. S13 in Appendix A) to estimate the time-varying mask-wearing intervention. The mask-wearing indices are displayed in Fig. S3 .\n",
            " The model consists of two self-correcting regularized multiple regression models, both of which are dynamically trained and regularized using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and are fitted for each of the four areas separately. Modeling parameters capture the short-term effects of one-week interventions. We estimated the effects in influenza seasons due to an intervention through a contrast of the imputed influenza activities under the scenario without NPIs and under that intervention alone. We estimated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 interference by comparing influenza activity using data from 2011 to the first report of SARS-CoV-2 and that using data from 2011 to the start of NPIs. The delay between the start of NPIs and the first report of SARS-CoV-2 enables the identification of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 interference. We assumed that there was no substantial difference in climate conditions, sociodemographic features, influenza transmissibility, and influenza vaccination coverage between 2020 and 2021 compared with those in previous years. We also assumed that the impacts of these external factors on influenza are consistent and can be captured by past influenza activity.\n",
            " We explored two self-correcting regularized multiple regression models to forecast the weekly influenza activity. Both regression models are dynamically trained and regularized using the LASSO method; unlike autoregressive integrated moving average models [53, 54] , they allow the self-selection of multiple lags (up to 52) of influenza activities as model inputs. The regression models are described as follows:\n",
            " First, we use a multiple regression model with a linear combination of lags of influenza activity as well as the current domestic mobility (denoted by ) and international mobility (denoted as ) to fit the percent positivity under the mobility change only (denoted as mob ). International mobility was included during the influenza season only; a sensitivity analysis considering international mobility throughout the year was conducted and compared to the baseline analysis.\n",
            " indicates the influenza season.\n",
            " The model is represented by\n",
            " (1) where α, , , and are the parameters, and represents the error term, with ~ℕ(0, 2 ), a normal distribution with variance 2 . Parameters α and capture the association between influenza activity and domestic and international mobility during the influenza season, respectively. Model (1) was used to predict influenza activity under various scenarios with different assumptions on mobility mitigation as well as SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Influenza activity in the scenario with no SARS-CoV-2 transmission is predicted from the first week when the first few COVID-19 cases are reported worldwide (i.e., Week 1 of 2020) [55] .\n",
            " Second, we consider a time-varying mask-wearing intervention, denoted by mas , the mask-wearing intervention at time . Mask-wearing interventions and NPIs related to mobility change are the focus of this study and are referred to as two major NPIs; other NPIs that may affect influenza activity are referred to as minor NPIs. We used npi to represent the percent influenza positivity for all NPIs. Since mob is capable of accounting for the NPIs associated with mobility change, the difference between npi and mob is attributed to the effect of the mask-wearing intervention and minor NPIs. Note that the effects of mask-wearing interventions can be isolated if they vary over time. We include lags of mask-wearing intervention to account for the lingering effect of mask use as well as the delay in the compliance [11] . The best value of is selected according to 2 criteria and reflects the accumulated intervention time required to achieve the maximal weekly reduction.\n",

            " )+ . The code is openly available [56] . Parameter selection for baseline and sensitivity analyses was detailed in Supplementary methods.\n",
            " A one-week increase in mask-wearing intervention, under the realistic contexts of mask-wearing intervention, was capable of dramatically reducing the percent positivity tests in all four areas, with the mean percent reduction varying from 11.3% to 35.2% (Table S4 in Appendix A). The accumulated intervention time needed to achieve the maximal weekly reduction (i.e., estimated lags of mask-wearing included) was 13 and 11 weeks in northern China and southern China, respectively, whereas in England and the United States, they were much longer, 24 and 35 weeks, respectively (Table S4) . Considering the longterm impact of mask-wearing intervention, we estimated that, during the 2020-2021 season, the mask-wearing order alone could lead to reduction in percent positivity of 19.8 (95% confidence interval (95%CI), 15.8-24.8) in northern China, 16.6 (95%CI, 13.1-21.5) in southern China, 13.3 (95%CI, 9.7-16.6) in England, and 15.2 (95%CI, 11.9-18.5) in the United States (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ), compared with the scenario without NPIs. A larger variation was identified when the timing of the maskwearing orders differed. For example, in northern China, the mask-wearing order started before the end of the 2019-2020 season, and the influenza positivity was estimated to decline by 12.3 (95%CI, 8.1-17.0) in the order alone. In the United States, the order started at the end of the 2019-2020 season, and no significant effect was found (Figs. 1(a) and (d) and Table  1 ). \n",
            " Compared with the mask-wearing intervention, the effect of mobility change was smaller. We estimated that for a oneweek restriction of international mobility during the influenza season, the influenza activity in the current week had an immediate percent reduction of 4.5% in northern China. The effects in southern China, England, and the United States were similar, varying from 1.7% to 6.5%. Domestic mobility mitigation measures had closer effects, varying slightly from 1.6% to 2.8% (Table S4) . Further, despite the differentiation in the timing and magnitude of mobility mitigation measures across areas (Fig. S2) , the international travel mitigation had a larger effect than the domestic movement mitigation (Fig. S4 (Table 1 and Fig. 2) ; 79.8%-98.2% of the reductions were attributable to the international mobility mitigation measures (Table S4 ). In the 2019-2020 season, only China implemented a short period of mobility mitigation, and we estimated that the reductions due to the mobility mitigation measures were 5.6 (95%CI, 2.0-9.9) in northern China and 3.1 (95%CI, 0.2-7.5) in southern China (Figs. 2(a) and (b) and Table 1 ). \n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 has an observable effect when it spreads throughout the influenza season. During the 2019-2020 season, we estimated that SARS-CoV-2 interference reduced percent positivity by 7.6 (95%CI, 2.4-14.4) and 10.2 (95%CI, 7.2-13.6) in northern China and England, respectively, and 4.3 (95%CI, 1.4-12.1) and 2.9 (95%CI, 1.1-8.3) in southern China and the United States, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 3 ). The reductions were only significant in northern China and England, where SARS-CoV-2 virus spread starting at the peak of the influenza season and was followed by small rebounds (Figs. 3(a) and (c)). A large effect (mean 12.0, 95%CI, 4.3-25.3) of SARS-CoV-2 interference was also identified in Hubei Province, China during the 2019-2020 season (Fig. S5 in Appendix A). However, in all four areas, no significant effects of SARS-CoV-2 interference were found during 2020-2021.\n",
            " In the sensitivity analysis, we found that the smoothing method and training window had little impact on the estimated effects, but the exclusion of seasonal indicators may result in small negative effects on mobility change (Figs. S6-S8 in Appendix A). We also conducted a state-level analysis for the United States, and the results were consistent with those for the United States (Figs. S9-S12 in Appendix A). \n",
            " Although international travel has been found to play an important role in the spread of influenza A (H1N1) virus in the 2009 influenza pandemic [20], evidence on face masks from clinical trials, with limited sample size and low adherence, appears controversial in mechanistic studies [11, [21] [22] [23] . Our results suggest that, in a large population study of the four areas, mask-wearing alone can substantially reduce influenza activity, comparable to combined NPIs. Mobility mitigation measures are mostly effective in flattening influenza activity in influenza seasons, with international mitigation making a larger contribution in areas where influenza profiles exhibit single winter-peak outbreaks (e.g., northern China, England, and the United States) and domestic mitigation in areas with a secondary summer-peak outbreak (e.g., southern China).\n",
            " It is important to note that the high effectiveness of mask intervention is obtained based on the actual acceptance of maskwearing measures during the COVID-19 period, with compliance to the order, the supply of mask, and the lingering habit of mask use being potentially higher than in previous years [11] . The estimated weeks of mask-wearing intervention needed to achieve the maximal weekly percent reduction are much shorter in China than in other areas, which is consistent with the literature on the differentiation of mask behavior among populations [23] . While the short-term effects of mobility mitigation in the four areas were similar, the long-term effects in the influenza seasons could vary substantially. These differences could be due to the differential duration and long-term impact of mobility-related NPIs. Notably, only domestic mobility in China gradually returned to almost normal levels after a falloff in early 2020; international mobility in all four areas remained at much lower levels by Week 28 of 2021 (Fig. S2) .\n",
            " We found that the impact of SARS-CoV-2 interference differed in the four areas, with the effects in southern China and the United States being particularly small. This is probably due to the low transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the two areas in early 2020, as the extent of viral interference relies heavily on the spread of the intervening virus [15, 24] . Of note is the large effect of SARS-CoV-2 interference in Hubei Province, China in the 2019-2020 season, where SARS-CoV-2 community transmission was widespread in most parts of the province. However, it is also possible that the interference depends on the circulating strains [25, 26] .\n",
            " This study adds to the literature in several ways. First, despite the wide association of NPIs to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of their individual effects and SARS-Cov-2 interference in seasonal influenza and in the long term, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves over one year. Unlike the early detection of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virological surveillance system for influenza has been established in many countries and can provide high-quality epidemiological and laboratory data for monitoring and evaluating influenza transmission. We relied on long-term surveillance data to independently estimate the individual effects for each area. Second, we found that mask-wearing is more effective than mobility mitigation in all four areas, although the relative advantage depends on the timing and duration of the NPIs. Given the relatively low cost [27, 28] , wearing masks for a short period could be considered an accompanying method for influenza vaccination in preparedness for influenza pandemics, or severe seasonal epidemics in populations at higher risk of developing severe complications, or having lower vaccine efficacy [29, 30] . Finally, the insight from our study could offer a starting point for understanding SARS-CoV-2 interference in influenza transmission. The results of SARS-CoV-2 interference suggest that the effect varies with the timing of the influenza season and the speed of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission, providing valuable knowledge for facilitating deeper understanding of viral ecology.\n",
            " This study has several limitations. First, we used the percent positivity reported by laboratory and clinical surveillance systems, but the total number of influenza specimens collected also dropped following the start of NPIs. Nevertheless, the decline coincided with that in the end of the 2019-2020 season when the influenza surveillance naturally decreased; the sampling specimens collected during the 2020-2021 season returned to normal [8] . Second, although in all four areas, no substantial differences in influenza vaccination behavior between the 2019 and 2021 seasons and other recent seasons were found [31] [32] [33] , in England and the United States, the yearly influenza vaccination uptake increases steadily with small values, which may result in slightly overestimated effects for these two areas. Third, we leveraged the COVID-19 vaccine data to account for the time-varying change in mask-wearing as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, and the effectiveness of the order may also depend on the type of mask used [11] and the presence of other personal protection behaviors (e.g., hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette). Fourth, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 interference relied on virological data in the 2019-2020 influenza season, and extrapolation of the estimates to other seasons may be inaccurate because of the potential distinct circulation strains. Furthermore, our domestic mobility data are collected from mobile phone users and public transport statistics, which may only provide an incomplete picture of human movement change [34] . Although this represents a limitation, in all four areas, the change in domestic mobility patterns during the COVID-19 period closely coincides with the mobility-related NPIs in each area ( Fig. S13 and Table S3 in Appendix A). Thus, our results on domestic mobility support the findings on school closures in an earlier study [35] . Finally, although the results at the United States state level are consistent with those for the United States, heterogeneity may still exist in cities across other large study areas.\n",
            " Influenza's global plummeting provides a great opportunity to understand the individual effects of mask-wearing and mobility mitigation at the policy level and offers a head start on interference from influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases. These findings are valuable for forecasting future influenza seasons [36] and for guiding healthcare policy and the allocation of healthcare resources [37] . Identifying and developing universal influenza vaccines are still of primary importance for influenza control. However, given the relatively low negative impact of wearing masks in relation to the burden of influenza [38, 39] , our results suggest that wearing masks for a short period could be considered as a coordinated measure to influenza vaccination in preparedness for seasonal and pandemic influenza in populations with low vaccination coverage, or when matched vaccines are not available, calling for a revisit of the role of mask-wearing in the World Health Organization (WHO)'s pandemic influenza intervention guidance [40] .\n",

            "Body Text: The optimum time for seed germination in strongly seasonal climates is as early in the growing season as possible to gain resources for growth and reproduction but not so early that survival is unlikely (Rathcke & Lacey 1985) . Thus a successful species requires some mechanism or mechanisms to prevent germination before, but not at, the optimum time so that the probability of encountering poor growing conditions in the period after germination is reduced (Angevine & Chabot 1979) .\n",
            " In the seasonally dry tropics most germination occurs early in the wet season (Torssell & McKeon 1976; Mott 1978 Mott , 1980 Marks 1983a,b; McIvor & Gardener 1991) . In these environments, species need to avoid germination on small falls of rain during the dry season as mortality can be complete during subsequent dry periods (McKeon 1985; McKeon et al. 1985) . Seeds then need to germinate early in the wet season as later-establishing seedlings are less likely to survive competition from established perennial plants and older seedlings (Ross & Harper 1972; Cook & Ratcliff 1984 , 1985 . Surface soil temperatures frequently exceed 50°C during the dry season in tropical areas (Mott 1978; Mott et al. 1981; McKeon et al. 1985) and exposure to such high temperatures is an important dormancy-breaking mechanism in some tropical grasses and Stylosanthes species (Mott 1978; Mott et al. 1981; Hacker 1984; Hacker et al. 1984; Hacker & Ratcliff 1989) . Herbaceous communities can contain many more species than those assessed already, so this study was undertaken to compare the changes in dormancy and germination of seed of a wide range of native and exotic species (based on Henderson 1997) collected at two sites typical of the seasonally dry tropics. The seed was stored under relatively constant laboratory conditions (control), exposed on the soil surface to simulate field conditions, or kept in an oven with fluctuating temperatures similar to those found on the soil surface (25/60°C). The oven treatment approximates the temperature environment experienced by seed in the field (Mott 1978; McKeon et al. 1985) but excludes other effects such as wetting/drying and fungal infections. Seed size has been related to seed germination and persistence and has been used to predict seed longevity (e.g. Grime 1989 ; Thompson et al. 1993; Bekker et al. 1998) . Germination rate may control germination in tropical areas so relationships between seed weight and germination rate were also examined to assess the utility of seed size as a predictor.\n",

            " Fully mature dispersal units (hereafter referred to as seeds) of 21 species were collected in April-May 1983 from pastures in either the Townsville-Woodstock (indicated by W after the species name) area of north Queensland or from Katherine (K) in the Northern Territory (Table 1) . Seeds of three species (Digitaria ciliaris, Heteropogon contortus and Hyptis suaveolens) were collected from both areas and commercial samples of Stylosanthes hamata and Stylosanthes scabra were also included giving a total of 23 species and 26 seed lots.\n",
            " The Townsville-Woodstock and Katherine areas are typical of the seasonally dry tropics which are characterized by a hot 'wet' season and a warm 'dry' season. Average annual rainfall is 1160 mm at Townsville and 860 mm at Woodstock with 84% falling during the wet season (December-April). Maximum temperatures range from 31 to 33°C in December to 25°C in July. Average annual rainfall is 970 mm at Katherine with 92% falling during the wet season (November-March). Maximum temperatures range from 38°C in December to 30°C in July.\n",
            " After collection, the seeds were stored at 22-23°C and 55-60% relative humidity in paper envelopes. The seeds were cleaned, and the awns removed from Aristida latifolia, Heteropogon contortus, Themeda quadrivalvis and Themeda triandra. Abnormal and empty seeds were discarded and samples of 50 seeds, all apparently sound, were counted. Seed weights were measured for four of these samples (i.e. 200 seeds).\n",
            " There were three storage treatments. 1. Laboratory. The seeds were stored in paper envelopes at 22-23°C and 55-60% relative humidity. 2. Oven. The seeds were stored in paper envelopes in an oven with a diurnal temperature fluctuation of 25/60°C. 3. Soil. The seeds were placed in fine, nylon mesh envelopes which were pegged to the soil surface in a level area, cleared of all vegetation and exposed to full sunlight, at the Davies Laboratory, Townsville. For each storage treatment, there were four, fully randomised replicates of each seed lot. The seeds were placed in the three locations on 4 July 1983, approximately 2 months after collection. The storage period covered the mid-late dry season (July-November) and early-mid wet season (December-February).\n",
            " At the time of placement and 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 weeks later, a sample of each seed lot from each replicate (i.e. 26 seed lots ϫ three storage treatments ϫ four replicates each of 50 seeds) was retrieved and tested for germination and dormancy. For four species (Bothriochloa pertusa, Heteropogon contortus, Themeda triandra and Urochloa mosambicensis), additional samples were retrieved after 36, 44, 64 and 96 weeks.\n",
            " Any seeds which showed evidence of prior germination were counted and removed and the remainder germinated in Petri dishes in a germination cabinet with a diurnal temperature fluctuation of 30/25°C and a 12-h day. Optimal conditions for germination are not known for most species but 30/25°C is in the optimum range for many tropical species (Ellis et al. 1985) . Germinated seeds were counted and removed daily for 14 days. Any seeds which did not germinate during that period were dissected and classified as dormant if the embryo and endosperm were firm and intact, or as dead if the tissues were pulpy and had begun to decay (Mott 1978) . There was some field germination after 16 weeks and it is possible some seeds in these samples classified as dead had previously germinated. This gave four classes of seed: field-germinated, germinable, dormant and dead. (For the two legumes, hard seeds were also counted separately but have been included in the dormant class.)\n",
            " The seeds exposed on the soil surface were located 10 m from the Davies Laboratory meteorological station where rainfall, and maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded daily.\n",
            " The data for the proportions of germinable and dormant seeds were analysed using factorial (seed lot ϫ storage treatment ϫ retrieval time) ANOVA after arcsin transformation to normalize the variances. Plots of cumulative germination over the 14-day test period were all sigmoid shaped so germination rate was estimated by fitting a sigmoid curve to the data, and calculating the number of days required to reach 50% of the final value. These values were analyzed by analysis of variance after logarithmic transformation. When the F statistic in the ANOVA was significant, the treatment means were compared by least significant difference (LSD, P ϭ 0.05). All analyses were performed in GENSTAT (Payne et al. 1988) .\n",
            " There were only 8 mm of rainfall during the first 12 weeks of storage but 17 mm fell in the 2 weeks prior to the sampling at 16 weeks ( Fig. 1 ). There were significant falls between all subsequent samplings with 225 mm during weeks 25-28, and 200 mm during weeks 29-32. Maximum temperatures increased from 23 to 25°C at the time of placement to 30-33°C during weeks 17-32. Minimum temperatures showed a similar increase from 10 to 13°C to 20-24°C. For the seeds exposed for a longer period, the second wet season commenced during week 75. Figure 2 shows examples of the changes in the proportions of different seed categories under different storage conditions. To reduce the volume of data presented, six species which cover the range of responses were chosen.\n",
            " For seeds stored in the laboratory or in the oven, there was generally little change in the proportion of dead seed with storage time. Under these conditions there were three patterns of change in the proportion of germinable seeds: little or no change (e.g. Stylosanthes hamata in the laboratory and Eleusine indica in both regimes), a gradual increase (e.g. Chloris gayana in both laboratory and oven) or a rapid initial increase followed by a period with little or no change (e.g. Brachiaria subquadripara, Aristida latifolia and Heteropogon contortus in both regimes). As there was little change in the proportion of dead seed, the change in the proportion of dormant seeds was the reverse of that in germinable seeds.\n",
            " The changes for seeds on the soil surface were markedly different to those of seeds in the laboratory or oven. The proportion of dead seeds generally increased slowly during the dry season and then more rapidly after the wet season commenced. For the proportions of dormant and germinable seed there were three general patterns. For one group of species, there was little change in the numbers of germinable or dormant seed until rain fell between weeks 14 and 16.\n",
            " After this, both components declined but some seeds remained dormant at the final sampling (e.g. Stylosanthes hamata). In a second group, the proportion of germinable seeds increased (and dormant decreased) during the dry season and the numbers of germinable seeds declined rapidly during the wet season. Within this group, the species could be divided into those with some dormant seed at the final sampling (e.g. Brachiaria subquadripara) and those with no seeds remaining dormant (e.g. Aristida latifolia, Heteropogon contortus, Chloris gayana). In the third group, high initial dormancy rates declined sharply with the onset of the wet season but germinable seed percentages remained low (e.g. Eleusine indica).\n",
            " To enable a comparison of all species, the percentages of germinable and dormant seeds in the initial and final samples, plus those on the soil surface at the end of the dry season (week 16) are shown in Table 2 .\n",
            " The dormancy level in the initial samples varied from low in the Katherine sample of Hyptis suaveolens to complete in Dactyloctenium radulans and Urochloa mosambicensis. No seeds germinated in the initial samples of eight species.\n",
            " For seeds stored in the laboratory, over 90% of the seeds of Dactyloctenium radulans, Echinochloa colona, Eleusine indica, Urochloa mosambicensis and Sida acuta remained dormant after 32 weeks. In all other species except the two Stylosanthes, dormancy levels decreased and germination increased although the effects were not always significant.\n",
            " Oven storage did not lead to significant changes in the percentage of dormant seeds in samples of Dactyloctenium radulans, Eleusine indica, Themeda triandra and Urochloa mosambicensis but dormancy levels decreased and germination increased (relative to initial levels) in other species. The percentage germination Values for germinable or dormant seeds of a species followed by the same letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). K, collection from Katherine; W, collection from Woodstock. at 32 weeks was significantly higher in oven stored than laboratory stored seed for five species (Digitaria ciliaris (K), Echinochloa colona, Stylosanthes hamata, Stylosanthes scabra, Sida acuta (K)) and values were similar in the two storage regimes for the remainder of the species except Heteropogon contortus (K) which showed the reverse pattern.\n",
            " In the field, after 16 weeks there was almost complete breakdown of dormancy in Themeda quadrivalvis, Sporobolus indicus and Hyptis suaveolens but dormancy remained at the initial levels in Dactyloctenium radulans, Eleusine indica, Stylosanthes hamata and Sida acuta. After 32 weeks in the field, 22 species had no germinable seeds remaining and germination exceeded 1% in Brachiaria subquadripara and Cenchrus ciliaris only. Some species had considerable dormant seed in the field at this time with more than 40% of the seeds of Dactyloctenium radulans, Stylosanthes hamata and Sida acuta in this category. For the species studied over the longer period, seed of Heteropogon contortus and Urochloa mosambicensis exposed on the soil surface had a second, smaller peak of germination around week 64 (Table 3) . After 96 weeks exposure, there was negligible germination and little dormant seed of any species stored on the soil.\n",
            " There was an approximately linear increase in germination rate (i.e. a decrease in the number of days to 50% of final germination) with time for all storage treatments (Fig. 3) . The laboratory and oven samples changed slowly (0.044 units/week) but the seeds on the soil surface changed more rapidly (0.104 units/week).\n",
            " To illustrate the differences between species, Table 4 shows the values for seeds on the soil surface at the commencement of the wet season after 20 weeks' exposure. There were large differences between species with half the seeds of Stylosanthes hamata, Themeda quadrivalvis and Aristida latifolia germinating within 16 h compared with over 4 days for Sida acuta and Hyptis suaveolens (K). Apart from Digitaria ciliaris (W) and Hyptis suaveolens (K), seeds exposed on the soil surface germinated faster than seeds stored in the laboratory.\n",
            " There was a weak negative correlation (r 2 ϭ 0.35, P ϭ 0.002) between germination rate and seed size.\n",
            " There were wide ranges of both initial levels of dormancy and rates of change of dormancy in these species under different storage conditions. Thus species with several types of dormancy characteristics coexist in these communities as previously described for temperate and desert communities (Angevine & Chabot 1979; Baskin & Baskin 1988 ).\n",
            " The general trend in dormancy levels was a decline with time with the rate of decline greatest for seeds exposed on the soil surface and least for those stored in the laboratory. The 26 seed lots have been divided into four groups based on dormancy levels (expressed as a percentage of the initial values) after 16 (late dry season) and 32 weeks (mid wet season) exposure on the Values for germinable or dormant seeds of a species within a treatment followed by the same letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). soil surface. On each occasion the species were divided into groups of high (above median value) and low (below median value) dormancy. The median values were 50% for week 16 (dry season) and 4% for week 32 (wet season).\n",
            " Group 1: species with high dormancy during both dry (mean ϭ 81%) and wet (mean ϭ 32%) seasons: Dactyloctenium radulans, Echinochloa colona, Eleusine indica, Bothriochloa pertusa, Heteropogon contortus (W), Themeda triandra, Urochloa mosambicensis, Stylosanthes hamata, Stylosanthes scabra, Gomphrena celosioides and Sida acuta.\n",
            " Apart from Themeda triandra, this mixed group of annual and perennial grasses, legumes and dicots are all good colonizers of bare areas and a number are major weeds in Australia and other tropical areas - (Holm et al. 1977; Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Mott 1980; Akobundu & Agyakwa 1987; Martin 1996) . Dactyloctenium radulans is an annual grass which increases under heavy stocking (Anderson 1993; Roberts & Silcock 1993 ) and can be a weed of cultivated areas and roadsides (Tothill & Hacker 1983) . Urochloa mosambicensis is a perennial grass sown in pastures but which is naturalized in northern Australia and can be a problem in cultivation (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977) . Stylosanthes hamata and S. scabra are important sown legumes in semiarid tropical areas and the high hard seed level is an important adaptation to the variable climate experienced in these areas. Gomphrena celosioides is a common weed of disturbed areas and often invades overgrazed pastures (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Anderson 1993) . Although all species in this group had high dormancy levels during the wet season and some may survive in the soil for a number of years (e.g. Eleusine indica; Hawton & Drennan 1980) , very few seeds of Urochloa mosambicensis and Themeda triandra exposed on the soil surface for a further 64 weeks were dormant at the end of the period.\n",
            " Group 2: species with high dormancy in dry season (mean ϭ 77%) and low dormancy in wet season (mean ϭ 1%): Chloris inflata, Pennisetum pedicellatum.\n",
            " These two annual grasses are common colonizers of waste land and can be weeds in cropping areas (van Rijn 1968; Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Mott 1980; Martin 1996) . This dormancy pattern results in the retention of the seed bank until the start of the wet season when most of the seed becomes germinable thus providing for mass germination events due to the high seed production of these species (McIvor et al. 1996) .\n",
            " Group 3: species with relatively low dormancy in dry season (mean ϭ 20%) but relatively high dormancy in wet season (mean ϭ 22%): Brachiaria subquadripara, Cenchrus ciliaris.\n",
            " Brachiaria subquadripara is an annual or short-lived perennial which invades legume-based pastures (Gillard & Fisher 1978; Gillard et al. 1980; Tothill et al. 1982) . Cenchrus ciliaris is a strongly perennial introduced grass widely sown in Australia and now naturalized in central inland Queensland (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977) and invading along river banks into mesic habitats in the arid zone (Humphries et al. 1991 ). The retention of some dormancy during the wet season The transformed (log [x ϩ 1]) values are shown in parentheses; the least significant difference for the transformed values ϭ 0.11 (P ϭ 0.05). For comparison, germination rates of seeds stored in the laboratory for the same period are also shown. *No seeds of Dactyloctenium radulans germinated.\n",
            " suggests some seeds of these species would persist in the soil, although showed Cenchrus ciliaris seed on or in the soil lost most of its viability within two years.\n",
            " Group 4: species with low dormancy during both dry (mean ϭ 20%) and wet seasons (mean ϭ 1%): Digitaria ciliaris (K) and (W), Themeda quadrivalvis, Aristida latifolia, Bothriochloa decipiens, Chrysopogon fallax, Heteropogon contortus (K), Sporobolus indicus, Chloris gayana, Hyptis suaveolens (K) and (W).\n",
            " This group contains predominantly perennial grasses, five native and one sown (Chloris gayana, which is now naturalised in central and southern Queensland), with two annual grasses and the dicot, Hyptis suaveolens. Mott (1978) showed seeds of a number of perennial native grasses were dormant at maturity but that dormancy was broken by the beginning of the following wet season. The low dormancy levels in the three weedy species in this group (Digitaria ciliaris, Themeda quadrivalvis and Hyptis suaveolens) is surprising although Marks & Nwachuku (1986) found there were few viable seeds of Digitaria ciliaris after storage in the soil for a wet season. These results suggest persistent seed banks will not be important for species in this group which rely on long-lived plants (perennial grasses) or frequent seed input (annual species) for long-term survival.\n",
            " Only one seed lot was used for most species but for the three species with collections from both Katherine and Woodstock there was some variability between species in the grouping of the collections from the two sites. Seeds for both collections of Hyptis suaveolens and Digitaria ciliaris were in the same group but the dormancy patterns for the two Heteropogon contortus collections were different. The sample of Heteropogon contortus collected from Katherine had lower dormancy than the Woodstock collection in both the late dry (17 vs 42%) and mid wet seasons (1 vs 17%). Such variation between collections could be expected as Heteropogon contortus is a variable species (Tothill 1966; Tothill & Hacker 1976 ) and a higher level of dormancy would be expected in a collection from an area with more variable climate (e.g. Woodstock) than one from an area with more reliable climate such as Katherine (McCown 1981) .\n",
            " In tropical areas where high evaporation rates mean that the soil surface may remain moist for only a short period following rain, germination rate may be the major attribute controlling subsequent establishment . Almost all species germinated faster after exposure on the soil surface than after storage for the same time in the laboratory. McKeon (1984) found a similar result with Stylosanthes hamata, Stylosanthes humilis and Digitaria ciliaris which all germinated faster after exposure on the soil surface to rainfall. The wide range in germination rates between species means there could be large differences in establishment after small falls of rain; some species had almost complete germination within 1 day whereas others required more than 4 days to reach 50% germination. Rapid germination may particularly increase the likelihood of establishment of smaller seeds in seasonally dry environments (Murali 1997) and in this experiment there was a weak trend for germination rate to decline as seed size increased. Similar relationships have been found with other suites of species or genotypes from the seasonally dry tropics (Krishnasamy 1986; Agboola 1996; Murali 1997) but not necessarily in temperate (e.g. Counts & Lee 1991) or cultivated species (e.g. Imrie 1972; Newell & Bludau 1993) .\n",
            " All but seven of the 26 seed lots had either low initial dormancy or significantly reduced dormancy after 16 weeks exposure on the soil surface. This is just prior to the median start of the wet season at Townsville (McCown 1981) . For three species (Dactyloctenium radulans, Eleusine indica and Gomphrena celosioides), dormancy level did not alter during storage in the oven also, suggesting dormancy-breaking is complex and not simply the result of high temperatures. found virtually no germination of Dactyloctenium radulans even after 8 years' storage in a laboratory unless the seed was scarified; treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid can also increase germination of this species (Silcock & Williams 1975) . Dormancy of Eleusine indica is decreased by gibberellic acid and potassium nitrate and can be broken by mechanical or acid scarification (Hawton & Drennan 1980; Kanzler & van Staden 1984) . Dormancy in the other four species (two Stylosanthes species, Pennisetum pedicillatum and Sida acuta) responds to high temperatures (Mott 1980; Mott et al. 1981) and it is possible the temperatures in the field were not sufficiently high to affect them; Mott (1980) found Pennisetum pedicillatum seed in the hotter environment at Katherine was nondormant by the end of the dry season and in this study there was a significant decline after 32 weeks in the oven.\n",
            " For the four perennial grasses stored for 96 weeks, there was negligible germinable or dormant seed for any species after two wet seasons exposure on the soil surface. This result is consistent with previous studies which have shown these species and a number of other common perennial grasses, usually have small soil seed banks (McIvor 1987; Howden 1988; McIvor & Gardener 1991 , 1994 . Removal of a species from the community for more than 1 or 2 years is likely to leave no seed available for re-establishment and could result in permanent changes to the community unless the species is able to recolonize from elsewhere or is deliberately reintroduced.\n",
            " We draw three major conclusions from this study. First, the dormancy and germination characteristics of the species depend on storage conditions with the changes for seeds stored on the soil surface markedly different to the changes for seeds stored in the laboratory or oven. Other authors working both with temperate (Grime et al. 1981; Baskin & Baskin 1988; Washitani & Masuda 1990 ) and with tropical species (Elberse & Breman 1989) have concluded that field behaviour can be related to laboratory germination and response to storage conditions. From this study, the most useful treatments will be those where the storage conditions are as similar as possible to the conditions actually experienced by seeds in the field, for example the soil storage treatment in this experiment. Second, there are a range of dormancy responses in species from these communities. This is true even within a plant type, for example all four dormancy groups were represented in the annual grasses. The major native perennial grasses had very low to low levels of dormancy after exposure on the soil surface during the dry and wet seasons but a number of weedy annual grasses and dicots (except Hyptis suaveolens) had medium to high dormancy levels at the end of the dry season which were maintained to different degrees during the following wet season. Third, provenance or seed collection site (they were confounded in this experiment) may affect seed dormancy patterns.\n",

            "Title: Seasonality of Suicidal Behavior\n",
            "Body Text: Several epidemiological studies have described a seasonal variation of suicide rates, with a highly replicated suicide peak in springtime [1,2]. However, recent studies have shown that the amplitude of OPEN ACCESS the spring peak is on the decline, while new small peaks are occurring at other times of the year, especially in industrialized Western countries [3, 4] . In spite of it being a well replicated phenomenon, the empirical finding of seasonal peaks in suicide is poorly understood.\n",
            " To date many risk factors for suicide have been reported and they can be categorized by demographic, social and clinical characteristics. Such risk factors include age, gender, rural/urban area of residence [5] , race [6] , month of birth [7] , socioeconomic factors [8] , marital status [9] , inter-personal relationships or life events [10, 11] , comorbid medical conditions, current or history of psychiatric illness [12] , allergy [13] , and most importantly, previous suicide attempts and violent methods of prior suicide attempt [2, 14] . Physical environmental factors, e.g., sunshine, temperature [15] , chemical (e.g., air pollutants) [16] and biological factors such as viruses [17] , parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, and aeroallergens [18, 19] have also been associated with suicide risk.\n",
            " Among the numerous risk factors for suicide, it is important to define those that are fluctuating, modifiable, and potentially treatable. Since the seasonal fluctuation in suicide has become a recognized and significant phenomenon, it is desirable to identify variables that consistently demonstrate an association with the seasonal variation of suicidal behaviors as well as completed suicide. For example, environmental factors such as the amount of sunshine and distribution of aeroallergens vary with the seasons. Moreover, clinical variables such as allergic illness, viral infections and mood disorders also manifest seasonal variations and such variations could potentially be associated with the seasonal variation of suicide rate.\n",
            " A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the seasonal variations in suicide could lead to improved and novel suicide prevention strategies. Therefore we comprehensively evaluated published papers, focusing on the potential association between suicide risk factors and seasonal fluctuation of suicide completion in various demographic groups and geographic locations. We also discuss the presence of seasonality of suicide, the strength and the clinical implication of the association for each risk factor.\n",
            " This is a comprehensive narrative review of journal papers on suicide seasonality published from 1979 to 2011. We carried out a comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE (1979-2011) using the keywords: \"suicide\" and \"seasonality\", cross-referenced with the terms \"age\", \"gender\", \"methods of suicide\", \"socioeconomic status\", \"sunshine\", \"temperature\", \"geographic region\", \"comorbid disease\", \"allergy\", \"mental illness\", \"infection\", and \"cytokine\". After we had identified potential publications of interest we read through the titles and abstracts and those selected were subsequently reviewed and categorized by suicide risk factors of interest. We only included articles in English. Among those, reports dealing with seasonality or monthly fluctuation were taken to review the relationship between seasonality and suicide.\n",
            " Environmental factors have been considered as possible mediators of the seasonal variation in human behaviors and therefore may also influence suicidal behaviors. Here we review physical (i.e., bioclimatic factors such as sunshine, temperature and rainfall), chemical (i.e., pollutants), and biological (i.e., viruses, bacteria, protozoa and allergens) factors as potential triggers of suicidal behaviors in spring or fall.\n",
            " Bioclimatic factors have been suggested to be potential mediators of the seasonal variation in suicide, though this concept is controversial. Some researchers have documented a positive association between sunshine/temperature/humidity and suicide [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , while others dispute this relationship [27] [28] [29] [30] . In addition, a few studies concluded that a positive association between climatic factors and seasonal variation of suicide was present only for suicide by violent methods [14, 31] .\n",
            " Petriduo et al. [32] suggested that sunlight may act as a trigger of suicide. In addition, suicide rates are greater in rural areas than in urban areas [2, 4, 33, 34] and higher among outdoor workers compared to indoor workers [35] . Some empirical findings support the notion that the intensity of sunlight may play a role in the triggering of suicide and therefore provide a potential link to the seasonal variation in suicide. Hiltunen et al. reported the association between increased suicide mortality and the period with the longest day length (which was between May and July) i.e., late spring/early summer [36] . Another study in Greenland reported a similar pattern. However, both studies suggested the role of latitude and other signals besides the variation in daylight, as the suicide peak of the northern area of Finland (Oulu) was delayed when compared to the southern area (Helsinki) and the strength of the suicide peak was more pronounced at higher latitudes [36, 37] . A recent analysis of data from Finland suggested a correlation between solar radiation and suicide mortality [38] but other studies have also suggested that seasonal suicide peak in spring occurs significantly later than the interval of change in day length [39] [40] [41] . Furthermore, Papadopoulos et al. [42] hypothesized that a time lag exists for the effect of solar radiance on suicidality. In summary, seasonal changes in sunlight seem unlikely to fully account for the seasonal variation in suicide.\n",
            " With regard to temperature, a study performed by Volpe et al. [25] found that suicide rates in Brazil not only showed a higher peak in December and January than the rest of the year, but were also significantly correlated with increasing temperature. In addition, Kim et al. [15] reported a 1.4% increase in suicide when temperature goes up by 1 degree Celsius. Temperature could either be a marker of seasonal change, or the mediator of it. In addition, specific meteorological conditions such as temperature and thunderstorm for the preceding day could contribute to increased risk of suicide in individuals [26] .\n",
            " Precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) is another climatic factor that shows seasonal variation and has thus been postulated to possibly be predictively associated with seasonality of suicide. When Ajdacic-Gross et al. [28] modeled monthly data on suicide and precipitation in Switzerland precipitation did not show any noteworthy effects on suicide frequencies. Lin et al. also examined the association between monthly suicide rates and climatic influences including atmospheric pressure, temperature, sunshine, humidity, and rainfall in Taiwan; however, they only found evidence of an association of temperature with seasonality, but reported no significant association between rainfall and seasonal peaks of suicide in spring/early summer [43] .\n",
            " Chew and McCleary [4] comprehensively compared the seasonal variation of suicide across 28 nations and found well replicated seasonal spring peaks in suicide rates from the various nations regardless of the location of the countries. They also observed wide cross-sectional variation in degree of suicide seasonality. For instance, when comparing Canada to Portugal they demonstrated a narrow range of seasonal fluctuation in Canada (ratio of average spring to average winter = 1.08) versus wide fluctuation of seasonal suicide rates in Portugal (ratio of average spring to average winter = 1.70) implicating a more prominent seasonal spring peak in Portugal.\n",
            " Consistent with the pattern in the northern hemisphere, Flisher et al. [44] reported a mirror image spring or summer peak of suicide and a trough in fall in South Africa, especially for less urbanized subpopulations. Similarly, studies in Australia [24] are concordant with studies conducted in the Northern Hemisphere in Europe [1, 10, 11, 32, [45] [46] [47] [48] and Asia [18, 49, 50] , identifying a seasonal spring suicide peak.\n",
            " Allergy has been previously linked to suicide [13] . The seasonality of suicide has been shown to co-occur with the seasonal peaks in ambient pollen concentration during spring (i.e., tree pollen), summer (i.e., grass pollen), and fall (i.e., ragweed) [19] . Pollens are aeroallergens and are capable of inducing an allergic inflammatory reaction when they reach the intranasal mucosa of susceptible individuals. The inflammatory reaction induced by aeroallergens involves the production of Th2 cytokines which, in animal models, have been associated with increased anxiety-like behavior, reduced social interaction [51] and aggressive behavior [52] all of which can be considered as endophenotypes for suicidal behavior [53] . Furthermore, the seasonal peak in aeroallergens resulting in the concomitant worsening of allergy symptoms could (via inflammatory mediators of worsening allergy symptoms) potentially worsens depressive symptoms, anxiety and impulsivity in mood disorder patients, resulting in exacerbated risk of suicidal behavior. Consistent with this notion, Manalai et al. [54] recently reported that in bipolar patients pollen-specific IgE positivity and worsening of allergy symptoms are associated with worsening of depression scores during exposure to aeroallergens. In addition, changes in allergy and anxiety (anxiety representing a potentially independent suicide risk factor) in patients with mood disorders exposed to seasonal peaks of aeroallergens were observed to be correlated [54] . In essence, the current available evidence makes seasonal fluctuation of aeroallergens a possible factor involved in the underlying mechanisms responsible for seasonality of suicide. This is particularly important from a neuroimmune perspective, considering a previous study showed an increased gene expression for cytokines involved in allergic reactions in the orbitofrontal cortex (a region previously implicated histopathologically with suicide) in victims of suicide [53] .\n",
            " The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with suicide [55] but no seasonal pattern has been reported in relation to HIV-related suicide rates neither has HIV been known to manifest a seasonal pattern of infectivity. The influenza virus, on the other hand, has a seasonal pattern of infectivity. However the only report of an association of influenza with suicidal behavior [17] did not include an evaluation of seasonality effect on suicide. More studies on the association of seasonal viruses and suicide are needed.\n",
            " Air pollutants have been correlated with rates of visits to the emergency room as well as inpatient admission rates of patients with mental illness [56] . Recently Kim et al. [16] found that the rate of completed suicide in the Republic of Korea was elevated when there was an increase in the ambient particulate matter two days prior to the day of suicide. The two aforementioned studies did not take into consideration the impact of the season on elevation of suicide risk. Szyszkowicz [57] , however, carried out an analysis of data on air pollution effect on emergency room (ER) visit for worsening depression by season and found that the highest percentage of depression-related ER visits were during periods of increased concentration of ambient particulate matter during the cold season and the finding was limited to only females. However, the findings by Szyszkowicz should be interpreted with caution (in terms of elucidation of the seasonality effects of air pollutants on depression), since the analysis did not include an assessment of an interaction between season and pollutant but rather an analysis by season was carried out. It therefore appears that the literature on the potential contribution of pollutants to the seasonality of suicide is sparse and no generalization can be made at this time.\n",
            " It has been well described that psychiatric disorders are associated with suicide and at the time of suicide completion, more than 90% of suicide victims suffer from a psychiatric disorder [58] . Reports from Finland showed an association between time patterns of attempted suicides and psychiatric disorders (e.g., mood disorders, substance use disorders and schizophrenia-related disorders [59, 60] .\n",
            " However, studies on the relationship between seasonal variation in the occurrence or exacerbation of mental disorders and suicide seasonal peaks are limited [45, 61, 62] . A study [61] conducted in Sweden showed a seasonal spring/early summer peaks among patients diagnosed with neurotic, stressrelated, or somatoform disorder; however, only patients with symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization were studied. Consistent with this study, Brådvik et al. [62] demonstrated a seasonal spring peak of suicide in a study of male patients with alcohol addiction. Rocchi et al. [45] also reported on the seasonality of suicide completion among patients with psychiatric illnesses. Recently, Postolache et al. [63] reported an increased amplitude of the suicide peak in spring among victims of suicide with a history of mood disorders (see Figure 1) . Another study carried out by Kim et al. [64] demonstrated seasonal spring/summer peak of suicide completion in depression and fall/winter peak in schizophrenia.\n",
            " In addition, significant seasonal peaks were reported in allergy-related asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. As allergy-related diseases are associated with suicide completion, seasonal changes in allergens may lead to seasonal increase in incidence and exacerbation of allergic disorders which in turn could potentially be associated with peak in suicide rates, mediated through molecular and cellular components of allergic inflammation affecting the brain [13] . Indeed, Timonen et al. [65] revealed an association between prior hospitalization for atopic disorders and seasonal variation of suicide. The authors estimated the monthly rate ratio of suicide relative to December. Conditional logistic regression analyses with adjustment for place of residence, marital status, income, and method of suicide were used to compare seasonality of suicide in victims with versus without hospitalization for mood disorders. A statistically significant spring peak in suicide was observed in both groups. A history of mood disorders increased the risk of suicide in spring (for males: RR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.31; for females: RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.32). Reproduced from [19] with permission.\n",
            " Several studies have found associations between age and seasonal variation in suicide. Maes et al. [2] reported that the suicide rate among younger people was increased in spring (i.e., March and April), whereas the rate within older adults was raised in late summer (i.e., August). However, Lahti et al. [66] observed a suicide peak in fall among adolescents, particularly for those dying by shooting. Furthermore, McCleary et al. [67] documented that a suicide peak was observed in younger aged individuals in winter and fall, while suicide among the very old was elevated towards the summer period. The inconsistency between studies may reflect methodological or environmental differences between studies and at the moment, no conclusion can be drawn.\n",
            " Although seasonality of suicide completion is seen both in men and women, the seasonal patterns differ between genders. For example, only a single spring peak is found in men, while two peaks in spring and fall have been reported in women [4, 33, 34, 40, 68] . In England, middle aged women who had school-aged children were more likely to commit suicide in fall, which was the beginning of the school year [4, 69] . Though speculative, it may be that a sudden reduction in the duration of direct contact with a dependent represents a type of suicide risk in these women. Gender effect on seasonality of suicide was also noted in Hungary where a steadily increasing prescription rate for antidepressants was associated with a decrease in national suicide rate but significantly decreased seasonality of suicide only in males [70] . The suicide peak in spring has been considered to be a consequence of seasonal occurrence of depression-related suicides and the decreased seasonality of suicide in this Hungarian study was suggested to be a marker of lowering depression-related suicides (especially among men) as a result of increased antidepressant utilization in the population [70] .\n",
            " Seasonality of suicide attempts is also shown to be associated with gender [71] . Studies performed in Scotland and in Oxford revealed a seasonal variation of female suicide attempts with increased rates during summer and decreased rates in winter, but no significant seasonal variation of male suicide attempts was found [72, 73] . In addition, the results of the WHO/EURO Multicenter study on Parasuicides indicated that the seasonal pattern of suicide attempts in women showed a peak in spring and nadir in winter, but no significant variation of suicide attempts was observed within the male subpopulation [74] . However, there have been negative reports as well. Mergl et al. analyzed suicide attempts in Nuremberg and Wuerzburg from 2000 to 2004 and they failed to confirm the significant gender difference in seasonality of suicide attempts [71] . Kreitman et al. also reported no considerable gender difference in seasonality of suicide attempts in the U.S. [75] .\n",
            " While several studies have reported season of birth effect on suicide or suicidal behavior [7, [76] [77] [78] , there is lack of evidence to indicate an association between month of birth and seasonality of suicide completion. Dome et al. [76] found a significantly increased risk of suicide completion among those individuals who were born in spring and summer, however, this study did not show any relationship between season of birth and seasonal variation of suicide. Another study which evaluated the effect of birth month on suicidal behavior in Western Australia reported a notable spring peak of deliberate selfharm and a significantly increased birth in spring within the deliberate self-harm group [7] . However, no season-of-birth effect was observed in relation to completed suicide in the study.\n",
            " Socioeconomic status can affect suicide rates. Social discrepancy, disputes, socio-economic gradient (urban-rural income gradient, etc.), divorce and resulting single parent family environment can be related with seasonality of suicide. The majority of research findings indicated that the seasonal spring peaks are greater in rural areas compared to urban areas [2, 4, 79] . In particular, Micciolo et al. [79] evaluated the seasonality of suicide in Italy from 1969 to 1984 and found the suicide peaks in spring to be more notable in rural areas than in urban areas, although the suicide rates was higher in urban regions. A review by Christodoulou et al. [80] suggested that this phenomenon might plausibly be related to intensity of seasonal activities such as agricultural work in the rural areas. In fact, Chew and McCleary [4] reported that the spring peak of suicide is relatively larger in agricultural countries compared to industrial countries. They also found that the larger amount of agricultural work is significantly correlated with the greater spring peak of suicide. Ajdacic-Gross et al. [81] further posited that as the traditional rural society is disappearing with industrialization, the seasonal variation of suicides might be attenuated.\n",
            " In addition, seasonality of suicide has been shown to be related to occupational differences. The agricultural and construction sectors usually have intense activity from spring to fall. Näyhä [40] found that suicide committed by people who served in technical, administrative, and service work (i.e., modern occupations) usually peaked in late fall, while people who engaged in traditional occupations (e.g., agriculture, transport, or manufacturing work) showed seasonal peaks of suicide in spring/ summer. Koskinen et al. [35] also examined seasonality of suicide in different occupations including farmers, forest workers, construction, and indoor workers. They documented that spring peak and winter trough of suicide pattern was observed in groups of farmers and forest workers. On the contrary, a significant summer nadir was shown within indoor workers. Moreover, in their sub-group analyses by suicide methods, 90.5% of farmers used violent methods, followed by forest workers (79.1%), construction (73.2%), and indoor workers (69.2%), indicating violent suicides decreased among indoor workers. Considering suicides by violent methods show remarkable peaks in spring [2, 43, 47] , it is plausible to expect seasonal spring peaks with people who are more likely to spend time in outdoor settings [82] . Migrant workers can be exposed to higher mental distress and suicide risk as dramatically depicted in the series of attempted or committed suicides in Foxconn production facilities in China between Jan and May 2010 [83] [84] [85] . However, seasonal variation of suicide in migrant populations needs to be further studied.\n",
            " These findings seem to indicate that people who are more exposed to the outdoor environment have a greater seasonal spring peak in suicide-thus, suggesting that factors driving seasonality may be more abundant in the outdoor environment. For example, increased seasonal work related-stress in farmers and increased exposure to outdoor physico-chemico-biological factors such as day length, light, temperature, pollution, pathogens or allergens may contribute to more ample seasonal suicide peaks.\n",
            " Suicide methods can be classified as either violent (i.e., hanging, firearms, drowning, jumping, cutting, or self-immolation) or non-violent (i.e., ingestion of poisons, drugs, gases, or vapors) in terms of lethality based on the International Classification of Diseases [80] . There appears to be seasonal variation of suicide completion by suicide methods. A number of researchers have reported seasonal variation of suicide by violent methods including hanging, jumping from a height, drowning, poisoning, and firearms [3, 41, 47, 66, 86, 87] . Suicide rates by violent methods peak in spring/early summer and dip in winter, which is consistent with the general pattern of suicide seasonality. Hakko et al. [39] reported that suicide rates by violent methods increased by 16% in May, while it correspondingly decreased by 15% in December. The patterns of seasonal fluctuation in violent suicides are well replicated, regardless of geographical region. Studies conducted in Europe including Finland [39, 88] , Italy [47, 68] , Greece [48] , Belgium [2, 89] , Greenland [37, 90] , Switzerland [1,81], UK [91] , Australia, New Zealand [92] , Asia [43] , and the U.S. [93, 94] found seasonal spring peaks in violent suicide rates. In Taiwan, however, the violent suicide peaks in summer rather than in spring [43] .\n",
            " Gender differences have been reported with the use of violent suicide methods. Lester and Frank analyzed a U.S. population-based data and reported seasonal spring peaks of suicide by poison, hanging, or firearms, in addition to seasonal autumn peaks for hanging or firearms among male victims [94] . In contrast, in female victims, they observed seasonal variation of suicide completion with spring and fall peaks by poison or hanging and with summer/late fall peaks by firearms. Furthermore, the study conducted by Yip et al. in which they evaluated Australia-New Zealand population based data, revealed a significant seasonal variation of suicide by hanging in Australian and New Zealand in males only [92] .\n",
            " Regarding non-violent methods, Hakko et al. [39] found two peaks of suicide rates within the non-violent subgroup approximately a 9% increase in spring and an 8% increase in fall. However, the majority of studies did not observe any significant seasonal spring peaks in suicides by non-violent methods [2, 43, 68, 89] . Pollen counts have been particularly related to nonviolent suicides in women [19] .\n",
            " As one of the possible mechanisms to explain the significant spring peaks of violent suicides, we can consider the role of neurotransmitters in violent behaviors. For example, serotonin concentration, is often associated with impulsive and aggressive behaviors [95] and tryptophan (the main precursor of serotonin) concentration in the brain shows a prominent seasonal rhythm with lower plasma levels measured in spring in comparison to other seasons [96] . Thus, researchers have postulated that low levels of serotonin in the brain could possibly have an influence on impulsive drives, violent behaviors, and potentially result in an individual committing suicide by violent methods [68, 96] . A counter argument against the proposition of serotonin mediation of violent suicide could stem from the findings from an Australian study in which hours of bright sunlight exposure were directly correlated with serotonin turnover in the brain, measured invasively [97] . Brain serotonin turnover was seven times higher during the summer than during the winter, thus not entirely consistent with a hypothesis of a serotonergic mediation of suicide seasonality (i.e., low serotonin in spring).\n",
            " A number of researchers have argued that seasonal variation of suicide by specific methods was determined by the opportunities to access the methods [3] . Ajdacic-Gross et al. [3] reported that whereas firearms and knives are normally available during the whole year, poisoning (especially pesticides) occurred in the planting season and drowning and jumping are mostly used in outdoor activity season. Lahti et al. [66] found that suicide by shooting among Finnish adolescents occurred more frequently from August to October and its monthly pattern was positively related to the duration of daily sunshine hours, which were suggested to be related to increased firearm availability during the hunting season in addition to other psychosocial factors.\n",
            " Seasonality of suicide by methods can vary across different time frames. Ajdacic-Gross et al. [81] looked at 120 year trends of suicide seasonality in Switzerland and determined that there was a decline of overall seasonal variation during 1969-2000 compared to 1881-1920. The most significant difference between the two periods was the attenuation of suicides by hanging and drowning, both of which previously had strong seasonal effects on suicide. Although statistically significant seasonal One of studies [29] which canno ncluding p [26] . Unfortunately, many studies assessed seasonality over a relatively short period of time with data gathered in only one country or even smaller geographic unit [29] . Also, it will be important to establish a consistent set of multilevel variables all studies must account for when analyzing seasonal effects. For instance, in our recent study, after adjusting for the density of psychiatrists, urban vs. rural location and income, significant relationships between airborne allergens and suicide across space have been lost, suggesting a spurious relationship [98] .\n",
            " In some countries, seasonal suicide peaks have a tendency of being flattened in terms of reduced amplitude and smaller proportion of variance accounted for by the season. Recent studies using data from England and Wales [99] , Hong Kong [100] , Sweden [101] , and Denmark [102] have demonstrated a diminishing seasonality tendency on suicides. However, this phenomenon does not apply in some other countries, such as Finland [20, 39, 41] and the United States [103] , where a resilient seasonality pattern continues to be found for suicides or parasuicides. Overall, there might be a possibility that the contribution of season, while present, is so small that it can be irrelevant when other risk factors, such as gender and mental illnesses, are adjusted for. Few studies have examined seasonality in the context of other risk factors [104] [105] [106] .\n",
            " A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to seasonal peaks of suicide attempts and completions, may lead to identifying factors that could be amenable to preventative interventions and result, in the longer run, in flattening seasonal peaks of suicide and possibly, improved suicide prevention in general\n",

            "Title: Regional disparity of covid-19 infections: an investigation using state-level Indian data\n",
            "Body Text: The vicious Covid-19 virus has its spectre all over the world for over a year now. There is a wave of research about various aspects of this infections which include dynamics of disease spread, (SIR models), the effect of social distancing on infections, the economic effects of Covid lock down amongst others. 1 However, scarce efforts are devoted to understand the regional disparity in infections and what particularly drives the cluster of infections in a country. In this paper, we explore this issue using India as a testbed.\n",
            " India is chosen as our case study particularly because of its wide regional diversity in several dimensions. In terms of land area, it is the 7th largest country in the world and it is the home to almost 1.38 billion people (second largest population after China). India is geographically and culturally diverse. Currently with 28 states and 8 centrally administered Union Territories, India speaks at least 21 officially recognised languages and practices 8 major religions having numerous sects within each.\n",
            " A staggering feature of India is its regional economic inequality. While states like Goa, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana are highly prosperous (along with the Union Territories of Delhi, Chandigarh and Puducherry), the eastern, north eastern and central states are lagging behind in terms of both economic and human development indicators. For instance, Goa had a per capita net state domestic product (NSDP per capita) of Rs. 467,998 at 2011 -2012 prices in 2018 -2019 , Haryana (at Rs. 226, 644) and Puducherry (at Rs. 220, 461) . At the other extreme, Bihar had a current Rupee per capita NSDP of just Rs. 43,822 in the same year which is just 9 per cent of the corresponding figure for Goa. 2 The discretionary transfers have not only grown as a proportion of revenue sharing with the states in recent years but have favoured states with higher per capita income. This is particularly true for transfers from the Union government that are allocated in accordance with a matching formulae. 3 In terms of human development indicators the inter-state disparities are perhaps astonishing. Kerala and Goa with near hundred per cent total literacy rates had infant mortality rates of 7 and 8 respectively per 1000 live births in 2016-2017. 4 These are better figures compared to Turkey (at 8.6), Ukraine (at 7.2), Kazakhstan (at 9.3), Brazil (12.4), Mexico (12.2) , Thailand (at 7.7) and Malaysia (at 7.3). The corresponding figures for Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan stood at 38, 47 and 41, respectively, which is worse than Kenya at 34, Tanzania at 36, and Uganda with 44.7 (in 2019-2020 according to the World Bank). Coming to literacy, with just 70.9% total literacy rate, Bihar is 6.8% below the national average total literacy rate of 77.7%. Total literacy-wise Andhra Pradesh is currently at the bottom with 66.4%, followed by Rajasthan at 69.7%.\n",
            " In terms of Covid infections, India is currently ranked as one of the leading Covid-19 epicentres in the world in terms of the aggregate number of infections. Since September 15, 2020, this virus is on a decelerating trend but it has taken a nasty turn particularly at the time when this paper was completed. It is unlikely that this virus will go away on its own without immunization of at least 60 per cent of the nation's population. The good news is that alternative vaccines are in place but it is uncertain whether it will reach all the vulnerable belts of the country within a reasonable deadline. Our study covers the pandemic period until February 21 and has nothing to say about the present massive spikes in cases and fatalities. The key results and the policy conclusion that we reach may thus be tentative. We use the state-level cross section as well panel data to identify the possible clusters of Covid infections in India. Our data source is the real-time database available in www. covid 19ind ia. org. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive dataset for Covid infections in different regions of India which are widely used by researchers.\n",
            " Two key findings come out of our investigation. First, Covid infections are clustered in the rich and industrial states with a high population density. Agricultural regions have fewer infections. Since tests can only detect infections, we find that more tests are undertaken in relatively prosperous regions which is indicative of uneven development and lack of governance in poorer regions. This is confirmed by the fact that tests are lower in states where there is inferior law and order and higher infant mortality.\n",
            " The second robust finding from our study is that infections are uniformly lower in regions with greater poverty. This is true for both urban and agricultural states. This result stands in sharp contrast with the experience of the developed hemisphere including United States. Our tentative hypothesis for this difference in response of infections to poverty is the hygiene hypothesis well known in the epidemiology literature that poor in developing country like India have acquired herd immunity due to exposure to different types of infections from childhood.\n",
            " Our paper relates to a fast growing literature on the effect of poverty and inequality on the incidence of pandemic. There is no robust convincing evidence that inequality has a negative effect on health although inequality when combined with poverty may have detrimental effect on health due to unequal health care services (Deaton, 2013) . In the United States, black, Hispanic and indigenous population were exposed more to Covid infections than whites (Hoyer and Morrison, 2020). Using preliminary US county level analysis, Abedi et al. (2020) document that existing rates of poverty, disease and the presence of ethnic minorities were all associated with higher infection. UK also has similar experiences among black, Asian and Middle Eastern (known as BAME) groups (Office of National Statistics, 2020). Finch and Hernández Finch (2020) find that more disadvantaged counties in the United States had a larger number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, and that the number of Covid-19-related deaths was associated with poorer and more urban counties. Quite remarkably, they observe that the testing for the virus was less available in more disadvantaged counties. Viewed from this perspective, the experience of India in terms of the relationship between poverty and cases is unique. Our study parallels Davies (2021) who undertakes cross country analysis of Covid-19 death rates and finds that poverty has a weak negative association with case fatalities. Our focus is, however, on cases and not on fatalities. 5\n",
            " The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present a brief literature review of the extant studies on Covid 19 in India. In Sect. 3, we report the main pockets of infections in India and point to some possible developmental covariates of infections. In Sect. 4, we develop a simple SIR model to put some structure to our regression analysis and report cross sectional regressions of the possible determinants of infections with a focus on development indicators in each state. In Sect. 5, we undertake panel regressions to understand the dynamics of infections and the effect of removing lockdown restrictions. Section 6 addresses the question why richer states in India are testing more. Section 7 explores the relationship between poverty and infections. Section 8 concludes.\n",
            " A number of recent studies have examined the trend in Covid-19 infections in India and its regional disparity. Jalan and Sen (2020a) were amongst the first to systematically observe on the basis of district level data till the midnight of April 5, 2020, that not all of India had been impacted uniformly by the virus, and that there was a strong case in favour of implementation of a more selective lockdown. The heavily affected districts included the metro areas of Delhi, Mumbai, Indore, Jaipur, Chennai, and Pune. The 20 significantly affected districts included Agra, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Coimbatore, and Thane while 42 districts were moderately affected, and 188 districts were mildly affected. The unevenness in the spread of the virus was understood by the fact that Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, and an additional 16 per cent of all the districts in the rest of India together reported 86 per cent of all Covid cases in the country. 6 In a later study for the state of Kerala, Jalan and Sen (2020b) found that the state effectively managed its first Covid wave by formulating a comprehensive set of government actions that were supported and complied by the state's citizens. The authors maintain that this was achieved by leveraging and reinforcing the citizen's public trust in the state. The regional disparity in COVID infections in India has also been observed by Mandi et al. (2020) . They constructed a multi-dimensional vulnerability Index for Indian districts with an aim to provide a direction for sequential lifting of the lockdown. Ray and Subramanian (2020) also noted the regional disparity in infections although their key objective was to provide an interim report on the Indian lockdown provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            " Our central research question is: how do socioeconomic and macro development indicators explain infection differentials across Indian states? This key question largely remains unanswered in the extant studies. Moreover, these papers hardly undertake an econometric investigation of the macro developmental determinants of the regional disparity of cases in India during the first wave of this pandemic. In this respect, our study is novel.\n",
            " Our observations based on recent state-level panel data on Covid statistics reveal several important empirical regularities. Data for total confirmed cases and tests Probing further to understand how infections associate with various developmental indicators, we find that the incidence of this virus (in terms of confirmed cases per million state populations) is significantly more in prosperous states in terms per capita net domestic product (PCNSDP) and with higher degrees of urbanization. This is shown in Fig. 3 . 8 We capture urbanization with the help of percentage of urban population at the state level (as per Census 2011 figures). Higher levels of urbanization and economic development invariably result in higher population densities at the state level especially because urbanized states attract migrant workers and people from backward and poorer states. 7 Cut-off from India's mainland, the union territories of Lakshadweep and Ladakh are dropped as outliers in terms of Covid-19 infections and population density. Data on several variables of interest for the UTs of Daman and Diu as well as Dadra and Nagar Haveli are unavailable. 8 For line graph plotting, variables are normalized to a (0, 1) scale for each state by means of a UNDP-HDI type attainment index formula to facilitate comparison. This is simply the difference of the actual Not surprisingly, there is a close association between state-level tests per million and reported cases per million as seen in Fig. 4 . The correlation coefficient between Footnote 8 (continued) tests and cases is 0.65 and is statistically highly significant (see Table 1 ).\n",
            " The larger question is: which states are testing more? A part of it is answered in Fig. 4 itself which shows that more urbanised states are testing more and as a result getting more confirmed cases reported. The degree of state-level urbanization may be taken as an effective proxy for the level of economic development in the Indian context. Table 1 presents a few key bivariate correlation coefficients. Few points are worthy of attention. First, cases (CASES) are strongly associated with tests (TESTS). More prosperous, urban and densely populated states with better infrastructure report more infections. Tests are happening more in developed states with better infrastructure. Agricultural share in state GDP (AGRI) is negatively associated with both confirmed cases and tests. Moreover agriculturally dominant states tend to have lower population density (DENSITY) as well as lower levels of urbanization (URBAN).\n",
            " Second, poverty measured by percent people below poverty line (BPL) has a significant negative association with confirmed cases per million which indicates that poorer states tend to have lower infections per million. This comes as a surprise because it goes against a few extant studies based on UK and US which find poverty as a driver of infections due to lack of Covid-safe social distancing. 9 In India also, it is difficult for the low income citizens to maintain social distancing besides maintaining the desirable standards of personal health, hygiene and sanitation. However, it should also be borne in mind that poorer states get tested less as evidenced by a negative correlation between cases and BPL. \n",
            " Motivated by the correlation matrix in Table 1 and the spatial distribution map of infections, we next explore the structural determinants of infections. To fix ideas, we start off with a simple discretised version of a SIR model formulated by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) . Population normalized at unity is divided in three distinct groups at date t, (i) susceptible S t , (ii) infected I t and (iii) recovered R t where S t + I t + R t = 1. 10 The rate of new infections is S t I t if infected and susceptible meet at a contact rate . The rate of recovery is γ. The evolution of SIR population is given by the relationship as follows:\n",
            " where ΔI t = I t+1 − I t with γ ∈ (0,1), > 0 . A t is a public health policy variable which depends on the quality of health care and availability of an efficacious vaccine. Everything else equal, the higher the A t , the lower the infections. The effectiveness of the policy in lowering infection is characterized by the parameter . We add a social distancing dimension to this SIR model. The contact between S t and I t groups is determined by social distancing ( D t ) . The higher the D t , the lower the contact S t I t . Let us posit:\n",
            " where c is a positive constant. Combining (1) and (2), we get a simple reduced form infection equation:\n",
            " The left hand side of (3) is the cumulative infection which depends inversely on social distancing. The social distancing ( D t ) is a behavioural variable which depends on a range of developmental and policy variables including lockdown.\n",
            " The steady state timeless version of (3) is:\n",
            " where a 0 = c −1 , a 1 = −1 and a 2 = −1 . Motivated by the reduced form infection Eq. (4), we first run a log-linear crossstate regressions in Table 2 to focus on various developmental determinants of infections across India. We choose PCNSDP, URBAN, DENSITY, BPL and AGRI as explanatory developmental variables.\n",
            " Few observations in Table 2 lend themselves for attention. First, level of urbanization and PCNSDP have significant positive influence over infections-a robust finding across all specifications. Second, the agricultural share in state GDP has a (1)\n",
            " 10 Since our focus is on Covid infections, we ignore deaths from this model.\n",
            " Log-linear regression of confirmed cases per million for 33 states and Union Territories in India Source: Estimated by the authors on the basis of secondary data\n",
            " (1) Numbers in the parentheses are t ratios where HAC adjusted standard errors are used in all cases. **means significant at 1% level and **means significant at 5% level.\n",
            " (2) The total state level confirmed cases and tests per million population are for 21-02-2021 Dependent variable: Log(Cases) dampening effect on confirmed cases. In other words, agrarian states tend to have lower infections. Third, BPL has a negative effect on infections significant at the 5% level. When BPL is interacted with URBAN, we find that it mutes the positive effect of urbanization on infections. This observation points to a potent testable hypothesis that people below poverty line living in more dense and urban areas may be resilient to this nasty virus. In other words, there is a nonlinear interaction between poverty and urbanization in determining infections. 11 In a nutshell, this cross section regression suggests that Covid infections are highly concentrated in more prosperous, urbanized (i.e., relatively more developed) and densely populated states. Poverty lowers infections and it mutes the positive effects of urbanization on infections. Agrarian states in India have lower population density and thus lower levels of urbanizations leading to lower infections per million. The percentage of work force engaged in agriculture (WFA) in the total labour force introduced in Model 5 adds new insights that explain the limited spread of the covid in agriculturally dominant states. Controlling for per capita NSDP, WFA shows a significantly negative influence over confirmed cases, implying that when income is controlled higher proportions of workers engaged in agriculture and allied activities control the spread of the virus to a significant extent. For instance, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, each with more than 70% work force engaged in agriculture and allied activities are amongst the lowest Covid-19 affected in the country.\n",
            " WFA is significantly negatively associated with urbanization as seen in correlations in Table 5 . The chance of Covid transmission is significantly lower in states with a higher agricultural dominance (measured both in terms of WFA and AGRI) due to lower population density. On the other hand, more urbanised states, (which are also states with greater proportion of formal sector or urban sector workers) have greater potentials of Covid-19 spread due to the failure to maintain ideal social distancing norms, as ideal social distancing practices in India are difficult to maintain in a fast and unrestricted urban life. In a nutshell, the poor and backward agrarian states may be practicing what may be called \"natural social distancing\" due to lower population density which explains less infections in these regions.\n",
            " We next run a dynamic panel regression motivated by (3) involving the same 33 states and UTs weekly data starting March 2020 till February 21, 2021 (47 weekly observations for each state yielding 1551 pooled observation). The results shown in Table 3 reinforce the observations of the cross-section regressions of Table 2 and 11 Similar nonlinearity is also found in Basu et al. (2021) who find that people socially distance less than rich in poorer and more densely populated districts in England. (1) Numbers in the parentheses are t ratios which use White's diagonally corrected standard errors throughout. **means significant at 1% level and *means significant at 5% level. give additional insights. A one period lag of log of cases is introduced throughout to eliminate serial correlation in accordance with SIR Eq. (3). In addition, we introduce an \"unlock\" dummy (UNLOCK) that takes the value unity for post July 1, 2020 observations and 0 otherwise, to demarcate the pre and post unlock 2 phases in India. The sign of the \"unlock\" dummy will capture the effect of less policy stringency of social distancing on infections.\n",
            " Few important observations are in order. First, the significantly high lagged coefficient of regression is indicative of the persistent nature of infections. One per cent rise in infections in the previous week is associated with at least 0.88 percent increase infections in the current week. Second, the \"unlock\" phase has significantly added to Covid confirmed numbers at the state level as seen in models 2 to 4 'UNLOCK coefficient is positive and significant. Finally, other things unchanged, higher poverty rates at the state level lead to uniformly lower infections which is a consistent finding across both cross-section and panel regression models.\n",
            " Finally we repeat our panel estimation of a similar family of log-linear regression models (see Table 4 ) but this time with the log differenced confirmed cases per million state population (which captures the weekly new cases per million) as the dependent variable. To capture the nonlinearity of the weekly count curve over time during March 2020 to February 2021, we insert time and time-squared as regressors and drop the 'unlock' dummy. Even though differencing introduces greater variability in the data, it is noteworthy that the negative BPL coefficient is still significant at the 10% level. The results are overall consistent with Tables 2 and 3. Time has a significantly positive coefficient and time-squared has a negative coefficient. In other words, new infections show an inverted U-shaped pattern meaning that it peaks and then dies out. The one period lagged coefficient is also akin to the previous regressions showing persistence in new infections and this pattern is consistent across all these four models. 6 Why are rich states getting tested more?\n",
            " Since TESTS and PCNSDP show strong positive correlation as seen in Table 1 , a natural question arises why are tests so much concentrated in prosperous regions of India? Do these regions have a better health infrastructure and better governance? States which are better governed and have a more robust public health policy are likely to undertake more tests. To this end, we take infant mortality rate (IMR) as a proxy for the adequacy of the public health infrastructure. In the Indian context, IMR is taken as a proxy for the state-level backwardness in terms of general health status and health infrastructure. Thus regions with lower infant mortality rate are likely to have a better health infrastructure and arguably better health status. Regarding governance, we pick the total crime rate (TCR) as a proxy for governance keeping in mind that TCR reflects reported and government recorded crime. Crimes reported but unregistered by officials are not included in TCR. In our view, better governance leads to more reported and registered crimes and so better governance may be reflected in higher TCR. 12 The correlations reported in Table 5 reveal that, high IMR states tend to have low TCR. Furthermore, the fact that URBAN and PCNSDP are positively associated with TCR but negatively with BPL and AGRI implies that while richer and developed states report and register more crimes, poorer states and states with higher AGRI do not. These are supportive of our idea of taking TCR as a proxy for governance. Strong positive correlations of TCR with PCNSDP and URBAN suggests that developed states in India tend to report more crimes and thus have relatively better standards of governance. In addition, the fact that high IMR basically captures state-level backwardness is understood from its significantly negative association with URBAN and PCNSDP (each of which are strong socio-economic development indicators on its own merit) besides its positive association with BPL (and even AGRI). In other words, developed states tend to have low IMR and this gives sufficient justifications for choosing IMR as an indicator of state-level backwardness. Table 6 presents the results of a dynamic log-linear panel regression of tests with TCR and IMR and URBAN as three variables capturing state-level fixed effects. After controlling for the serial correlation in tests (by addition lagged test variable as a regressor), the state-level infrastructure and governance variables are significant determinants of tests. States with better health and urban infrastructure and better governance carry out more tests which is consistent with the bivariate correlations reported in Table 1 .\n",
            " What is surprising is the response of infections to poverty. Poor people are less susceptible to infections in India which is a robust finding of our study. This finding stands in sharp contrast with the experience of the developed countries, particularly USA and UK where low income essential workers are more affected by the virus compared to the rest of the population. What are the possible reasons for this stark difference in response of infections to poverty in India compared to the developed counterpart of the world? Two hypotheses lend themselves. First, it is possible that poor states are testing less and thus less infections are reported there. This possibility cannot be ruled out given that correlation coefficient between BPL and cases is negative in Table 1 and it is mildly significant statistically.\n",
            " The second hypothesis is the hygiene hypothesis first introduced by the epidemiologist Strachan (1989) who found that children in larger households contracted less hay fever because they are exposed to germs from older siblings. Further research suggested that lack of early childhood exposure to unhygienic environments can make the adults more vulnerable to various kinds of infections. 13 It is not implausible to hypothesize that in India poor may be immune to various kinds of infections due to unhygienic living conditions from early childhood while in the developed world, the basic health infrastructure permits low income people to access clean and germ free environment from their childhood. Although this hygiene hypothesis is just a conjecture and it needs greater scrutiny, we tend to subscribe to it for the following reasons. We have computed the correlation between case fatalities and the level of development. The correlation coefficient between PCNSDP and FATALITY is a staggering 0.76 which is highly significant implying that the richer states have experienced the highest death rates. In other words, better off people in India died more of Covid cases.\n",
            " We also have some anecdotal evidence to support this hygiene hypothesis. In India, supply of semi-skilled and unskilled migrant workers engaged in Construction as well as Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) comes from distant rural areas. Under severe distress these migrant workers were forced to leave these urban centres (not just Delhi alone) during the first wave and stringent phase of the lockdowns (i.e., 25th March to 14th April, 2020) resulting in the 'infamous' mass urban-rural exodus in India. It is noteworthy that despite this mass movement of migrant workers, the Covid did not spread significantly to poor and backward northern states (mostly Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh) from where the migrant workers mostly originate. This event reinforces our claim on herd immunity among the poor sections of the society.\n",
            " Our study shows that Covid infections have significant regional disparity in India. Infections are more concentrated in prosperous Indian states with higher levels of urbanization coupled with high population density. By default, agrarian states have been affected less on account of lower levels of population density and urbanisation. Second, we find that tests also display significant regional disparity. Prosperous states with a better health infrastructure and governance undertake more tests and this also explains why more infections are reported in these regions. Third, a robust finding is that poverty has a dampening effect on infections which suggests some degree of herd immunity among the poor as well as less tests done in poor states.\n",
            " Our dynamic panel regressions based on the first wave of the pandemic suggest that infections are persistent and new infections seemed to reach plateau and then started declining. Evidently this dynamics has now reversed with the new wave of infections which is beyond the scope of our study. The unlock phase during the post July 2020, has added significantly to state-wise Covid numbers. The policy lesson that we learn from this exercise is that, the authority should continue to monitor densely populated urban areas without compromising the standard of Covid prevention protocols including the rates of testing in poor, remote and backward Indian states.\n",
            " Although a couple of efficacious vaccines are already in place, the universally accepted Covid protocols of safe social distancing with mandatory preventive measures as masks and sanitizers are the only means of decelerating the rate of spread of Covid infections. As new official reports about the spread of a more potent and virulent strain of this virus arrive, it is crucially important that crowds and gatherings are controlled and Covid surveillance practices are aggressively stepped up by state governments including punitive actions in all cases of violations. After all, Covid prevention and control is an issue that is inextricably linked with the quality and efficiency of governance at the local levels together with the efficacy of the vaccines.\n",
            " Our study can be extended further. We have focused on the first wave of infections and only looked at cases not fatalities. Given the present trend in Covid-19 now, it is important to explore the dynamics and regional variation of case fatalities in India. Such a study also requires careful modelling of multiple Covid cycles using the SIR framework.\n",

            "Title: Association between viral seasonality and meteorological factors\n",
            "Body Text: The common cold is typically a mild upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), with symptoms such as nasal stuffiness and discharge, sore throat, coughing and sneezing 1, 2 . URTI are mostly self-limiting but can progress to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) particularly in those with underlying conditions 3, 4 . Adults suffer from a cold two to five times a year, and children can have 7-10 episodes annually 5 . Numerous viruses can cause URTI 6 . Rhinoviruses (also called the common cold virus), are responsible for around 30% to 70% of all respiratory infections 5, 6 . Since there are >100 different rhinovirus types, reinfections are very common 7 . Coronavirus is the second most common cause of URTI, causing 7% to 18% of cases 8 . Other viruses including respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) types A and B, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1-4, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and influenza viruses A-C (IAV, IBV and ICV) also cause URTI 8,9 . Most respiratory viral infections have seasonality. In temperate regions, URTI increase in frequency in autumn and spring, and remain raised through winter 8 . Three theories have been put forward to explain viral seasonality. 1: The effect of climatic conditions on host resistance to infection (low vitamin D levels following lack of sun exposure can affect our ability to fight infection) 9,10 . 2: The effect of meteorological factors (e.g. temperature, humidity) on virus survival and hence on infection rates 9, 11 . 3: The effect of behavioural changes on transmission (e.g. spending more time indoors in close proximity to others or aggregation of susceptible children at schools during the colder months) 8,9 . There are other hypothesis such as diminished immune responses in a chilled host, or the reactivation of dormant viruses by chilling for the increase in URTI during the colder months 12 .\n",
            " Temperature has an important effect on viral activity, particularly in the case of enveloped viruses. In a guinea pig model, IAV transmission is more effective in cold and dry conditions 13 . Integrity of IAV envelopes are better at lower temperatures, whilst in warm temperatures, the envelope becomes disordered and the virus susceptible to damage 14 . Reports suggest that IAV survival is better associated with absolute humidity (which measures the amount of water vapour in air regardless of the temperature) rather than relative humidity 15, 16 . An association of absolute humidity with hospitalisation due to influenza LRTI (but not with LRTI due to Rhinovirus or RSV) has recently been reported 17 .\n",
            " Most reports on viral seasonality concentrate on viruses that appear in the winter months, particularly influenza viruses and RSV. Here we aim to determine the seasonality of all the respiratory viruses detected over 6.5 years, and identify any associations between changes in meteorological factors (such as temperature or humidity) and the appearance of different viruses across a whole year.\n",
            " Between April 2009 and November 2015, rhinoviruses and adenoviruses were present throughout the year. Rhinoviruses were present most days of the year (84.7%), followed by adenovirus which was present on 52.3% of the days. RSV (36.4%), HMPV (32.8%) and IAV (32.7%) were present in around 1/3 rd of the year. HPIV-3 was present in 24.6% of days, followed by HPIV-1 (15.5%) and IBV (15.2%). HPIV-2 was present for the fewest number of days (6.5%) ( Table 1) . Children ≤10 accounted for 45% of the number of samples tested. The age groups of those tested are in Table 2 . Figures 1-3 plot the weather conditions and the virus prevalence during the study period. Mean air temperature ( Fig. 1) showed the expected seasonality, with a peak in July (14 °C to 16 °C) and a trough in January (−1 °C to 4 °C). Mean dew point (Fig. 1 ) and the variation in humidity within a day (i.e. \"humidity-range\", Fig. 3 ) showed a similar pattern. Mean dew point was highest in August (10 °C to 12 °C) and lowest in February (−2 °C to 3 °C). \"Humidity-range\" was larger in the summer months (40% to 44%), and least variable in winter (15% to 18%). Mean relative humidity however showed the opposite pattern, typically highest in December (88% to 91%) and lowest in June (70% to 74%). Air pressure, wind speed and duration of daylight did not show clear seasonality (data not shown).\n",
            " Many viruses have a definite seasonality (Figs 1-3 ). RSV and IAV have the largest seasonal peaks, appearing in November-December and December-January respectively. IBV (February-March), HMPV (March), and HPIV-3 (April-May) follow sequentially. IBV has a biennial distribution occurring every other year. HPIV-2 has two peaks, a major peak around October-November and a minor peak in July. A clear seasonality is not noticeable for HPIV-1. Adenovirus and rhinovirus are present throughout the year. Rhinovirus also has two peaks, a major peak around October-November and a minor peak in March. Adenovirus has a smaller peak in March-April.\n",
            " Temperature appears to have the greatest effect on viral seasonality (Fig. 1) . The average temperature during the study was 9.2 °C. In keeping with their year-round presence, the mean temperature when adenovirus and rhinovirus are present is closer to the annual mean at 8.8 °C and 8.9 °C respectively. A preference for colder temperatures is noticeable for RSV, IAV, and IBV (6.3 °C, 6.7 °C and 6.3 °C respectively). HMPV is most prevalent when the temperature becomes slightly warmer (7.4 °C). HPIV-3 is the only virus to prefer above average temperatures (9.4 °C). The average dew point was 6.0 °C (Fig. 1) . Dew point has a similar pattern of relationship to viruses as temperature, with RSV (3.7 °C), IAV (3.9 °C), IBV (3.3 °C) and HMPV (4.4 °C) preferring lower dew points. In contrast, HPIV-3 prefers a higher dew point (5.9 °C). Temperature and dew point are both significantly lower on days adenovirus, RSV, IAV, IBV, and HMPV are present ( Table 3) .\n",
            " The average relative humidity was 81% over the study period (Fig. 2) . RSV (84%), IAV (82.9%) and HPIV-1(82.6%) prefer higher relative humidity. HPIV-3 is more active when the relative humidity is lower (79.9%) ( Table 3 ). The average variation in humidity within the day (i.e. \"humidity-range\") was 25%. \"Humidity-range\" is significantly narrow for most viruses apart from rhinovirus, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 (Table 3) . RSV (21.8%) and IAV (23.8%) prefer much narrower ranges then other viruses. HPIV-3, in contrast to the other viruses, appears to prefer a wide \"humidity-range\" (29.7%). Though HPIV-2 seems to prefer raised humidity and a narrow \"humidity-range\", the difference in these variables between days the HPIV-2 is present or absent is insignificant (Table 3) , potentially a reflection of the lower number of HPIV-2 cases. Table 4 shows the results of the binomial logistic regression carried out to determine the effect of multiple metrological factors on virus activity. It demonstrates how a unit increase in each meteorological variable (either 1 °C for mean temperature, or 1% for mean relative humidity or \"humidity-range\") alters the odds of a virus being present. Only results that were found to be significant in the t-test were examined using logistic regression (i.e. rhinovirus and HPIV-2 were excluded). Following the logistic regression, no significant association was found for HPIV-1. A mean temperature increase by 1 °C reduces the odds of detecting adenovirus, RSV, IAV, IBV and HMPV. Adenovirus has a small decrease (2.8%), while RSV (17.3%), IAV (13.7%), IBV (13%) and HMPV (9.9%) have larger decreases. A 1% increase in relative humidity reduces the odds of HPIV-3 being present (2.6%). A 1% increase in \"humidity-range\" also decreases the odds of detecting RSV (3.8%) and IAV (1.7%). Air temperature has a significant effect against the most number of viruses (n = 5) followed by \"humidity-range\" and relative humidity. The smaller effect of \"humidity-range\" in comparison to mean temperature may be due to an interrelationship between mean humidity and \"humidity-range\", since logistic regression takes multiple variables into account. Figure 4a -c are the generalised linear models (GLM), examining each virus' incidence across a year, averaged over the entire study period. This was compared with temperature over the same period. These models confirm a preference for colder temperatures for RSV, IAV and IBV, and the timings of their seasonal peaks in and around 17 th December, 12 th January and 8 th February respectively. Even though rhinovirus and adenovirus are present throughout the year, their GLM's point to periods of increased activity (around the 5 th of March for Adenovirus and around the 6 th November for rhinovirus). The GLM corroborates HPIV-3's preference for warmer temperatures and its seasonal peak around the 4 th of May. Finally, the GLM suggests that HMPV peaks around the 11 th of March, HPIV-1 peaks around the 31 st October, and HPIV-2 peaks around the 15 th of November.\n",
            " From Fig. 4a -c, a rough order of seasonal peaks is noticeable for the different viruses, beginning with IAV in January. After this, there are peaks of IBV in February, HMPV and Adenovirus in March, HPIV-3 in May, HPIV-1 in the end of October, rhinoviruses, and HPIV-2 in November, and ending with RSV in December. Since temperature and humidity appear to have a significant impact on viral incidence when analysed individually, we Table 3 . Comparison of mean meteorological values on the days a virus is detectable or undetectable. CI: Confidence interval, p value from T test. Significant p values in bold. We measured the mean of each meteorological factor on days when we received positive samples for a given virus and on days where we did not receive a positive sample for that virus. Hence a larger difference in means denotes that a virus is commonly present at an extreme of that meteorological factor: e.g. RSV more often being present when temperature is lower.\n",
            " Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:929 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37481-y calculated the difference in mean temperature and humidity preferred by the different viruses and arranged them in the order as above (Table 5 ). Figure 5 represents this pattern visually using results from ANOVA. Starting with the seasonal peak of IAV in January, there is a decrease in relative humidity from 82.9% to 81.7% in February, along with a decrease in mean temperature from 6.7 °C to 6.3 °C. These changes are associated with peaks in incidence of IBV. Following this, relative humidity stabilises until March. However, the mean temperature rises significantly to 7.4 °C in March corresponding with the peak in HMPV and then further to 8.8 °C when a peak in adenovirus occurs. Next, there is a further increase in temperature to 9.4 °C along with a significant reduction in relative humidity to 79.9% in May when a peak in HPIV-3 is observed. A slight drop in mean temperature (8.4 °C) and a significant increase in mean relative humidity (82.6%), from May to October is associated with a peak in HPIV-1. With mean temperatures being fairly constant, a further drop in relative humidity (81.6%) is associated with a peak in rhinovirus activity in November. A slight increase in humidity and a drop in temperature in November is associated with the presence of HPIV-2. A dramatic drop in temperature to 6.2 °C and an increase in relative humidity to 84.0%, leads to the peak in RSV in December. Then the cycle begins anew with IAV in January.\n",
            " Du Prel et al. have reported that air temperature and relative humidity were important factors affecting viral seasonality in Germany over a 6-year period 18 . As in our study, air pressure did not have a significant correlation. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to report the association between meteorological conditions and the sequential appearance of viruses through the year and the effect of daily fluctuations in humidity (i.e. \"humidity-range\") on virus seasonality. Our data shows that all the viral agents of URTI show degrees of seasonal variation corroborated by the GLM. Based on similarity in structures and seasonality, there appear to be three groups. 1: Non-enveloped viruses (rhinovirus and adenovirus) which are present throughout the year. 2: Enveloped viruses with winter preponderance (RSV, HMPV, IAV and IBV) and 3: Parainfluenza viruses 1-3, enveloped viruses with a preference for warmer temperatures.\n",
            " In our study, non-enveloped agents are present year-round with some seasonal variation. Adenovirus is known to be stable at high humidity levels (80%) 19 . Since this is very close to the mean humidity for the study period (81%), this could explain the presence of adenovirus throughout the year. Davis GW showed that adenovirus survival is better at high humidity levels (89%) than at lower humidity (50%) 20 . The peak in March found in our GLM for adenoviruses is different to the December peaks observed for enteric adenoviruses in Japan, though a peak in the winter months is seen when GLM was drawn for 2011, a year when visual peaks for all viruses were present (Supplementary Fig. 1) 21 . Our results show that adenoviruses prefer temperatures around 9 °C. The inverse relationship between adenoviruses and temperature, corroborated by the lower OR, is in keeping with the report from Germany 18 .\n",
            " The year-round presence of rhinoviruses is similar to other reports 18, 22 , but the November peak found using the GLM is later than the September-October peaks found in other research. However, as these two peaks correspond to when children go back to school, it is possible that meteorological factors do not solely account for these peaks. As rhinovirus is present throughout the year, there appears to be no significant difference in meteorological factors on days rhinovirus is present or absent. This is unlike the negative correlation with temperature and a positive correlation with relative humidity reported from Germany 18 . Whether this reflects the climatic conditions of the UK (being an island) compared to Germany needs further evaluation.\n",
            " In our study, enveloped viruses with peaks in the winter months, had an association with lower temperatures, dew points and humidity-ranges, and preference for higher humidity. A significant relationship with low temperature, dew point and high relative humidity have been reported for RSV 23, 24 , IAV 18,25 and IBV 25 . RSV and IAV appear to be associated with lower temperatures, dew point, \"humidity-range\" and high humidity, however, by logistic regression significant association is only seen with lower temperatures and lower \"humidity-ranges\". IBV and HMPV which appear to be associated with lower temperatures, dew point, and \"humidity-range\", are only associated with lower temperature by logistic regression. This illustrates the complex interaction between different meteorological factors and hence the difficulty in understanding their specific effects on viral prevalence. IBV has a biennial pattern in Edinburgh unlike the bimodal pattern from Okinawa, a subtropical region in Japan 26 . This suggests that local meteorological variation and factors affecting transmission and herd immunity might have a role to play in viral seasonality. Other studies have also reported early spring peaks of HMPV, Table 5 . Comparison of mean temperature and mean humidity for different viruses. To determine which variable significantly affects transition from one virus to another, we calculated the differences in mean temperature and relative humidity of virus in column minus virus in row. e.g. a decrease in temperature from autumn to winter is associated with a change from HPIV-2 to RSV. T = Temperature Difference, H = Humidity difference. Results of ANOVA. Significant p values in bold (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).\n",

Changes in mean temperature and mean relative humidity associated with sequential increase in activity of viruses between January and December (vertical lines -standard error of the mean). Each data point corresponds to the mean temperature or mean relative humidity during the period when the virus is most active (e.g. IAV in January).\n",
            " Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:929 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37481-y association with low temperature 27,28 and raised relative humidity 29 . The biennial pattern for HMPV reported from Germany 30 , Austria 30 and Sweden 31 , is not seen in our study. Both RSV and IAV appear when the relative humidity is high (83% to 84%) in Edinburgh. Others have reported variable findings, with some reporting a positive association 18 , and others reporting that enveloped viruses are better transmitted in low humidity 32 . For example, Iha Y et al. reported an inverse correlation with relative humidity for influenza A and a direct association with relative humidity for influenza B from Japan 26 . Since relative humidity is significantly associated only with HPIV-3 on logistic regression, the absolute value of humidity may be less important than fluctuation in humidity to the survival of the virus, particularly with viruses predominantly seen in the Autumn and Winter. It is possible that temperature and \"humidity-range\" could both have a combined impact on viral stability. In laboratory conditions, RSV survives for longer at lower temperatures, with infectivity falling rapidly as temperature increases. It is known that freezing and thawing leads to marked reduction in infectivity of RSV 33 . The preference for a narrow \"humidity-range\" and the change in relative humidity associated with changes in temperature 34 could explain why viruses are not stable in frost-free freezers which have to warm up regularly to prevent accumulation of ice in the freezer compartment. This needs further investigation. HPIV 1-3, despite being enveloped RNA viruses, seems to prefer warmer temperatures (8.2 °C-9.4 °C) than the other enveloped RNA viruses. Due to its low incidence over our study period, the seasonality of HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 remain unclear though the GLM suggests it is around October-November. There is a possibility of a biennial seasonality for HPIV-1, similar to that reported in the US 35 , but the trend remains unclear due to the low prevalence in our study. Unlike HPIV-1 and 2, HPIV-3 increases when temperature is highest (9.4 °C) and when relative humidity is lowest (79.9%). HPIV-3 also appears to tolerate large variations in \"humidity-range\" (29.7%). Following logistic regression, HPIV-3 is associated with lower relative humidity. The seasonal peak for HPIV-3 in May 35 , its stability at lower relative humidity 36 and higher temperatures 28, 36 have been reported previously. Our results indicate that most viruses prefer stable humidity (i.e. a lower \"humidity-range\") through the day. This requires confirmation from further studies.\n",
            " There are some limitations to this study. There is a possibility that the samples tested may include those who do not live in the catchment area. As the data is anonymised, it is not possible to determine whether the individuals are tourists or residents of the area. However, since all samples tested over the time period were analysed we believe that it is as representative as it can be. And, as the incubation period in viral respiratory infections is relatively short, it is unlikely that a viral infection will have originated abroad unless the patient was infected just prior to travelling to Edinburgh, which should be a relatively small percentage of the overall population examined in this study. Another limitation is that our data only represents those who sought medical care and were then tested. Hence a time lag between the individual becoming infected, becoming symptomatic and subsequently becoming unwell enough to require medical attention is present. We have not corrected our data for incubation period or for duration of illness prior to sampling. We have analysed the proportion of positive results for each virus for each day. Since proportion depends both on the number of positive results and on the total number of samples tested, it does not directly reflect the number of positive cases. We did not analyse coronavirus seasonality as it was not part of the routine testing panel during that period. Since meteorological factors can be interlinked (e.g. dew point and relative humidity), examining the effects of individual meteorological factors on viral seasonality can lead to an incomplete picture 37 . We hence attempted to tease this out by performing logistic regression on variables which showed an association in the univariate analysis. Since dew point was removed to prevent collinearity affecting the results of logistic regression, a new regression could in the future be performed to analyse the impact of dew point by removing temperature. There is a preference for stable \"humidity-range\" in most enveloped viruses except for HPIV-3. Following a visual inspection of the minimum and maximum for each variable and comparison with virus seasonality patterns for different viruses, there appeared to be a relationship between \"humidity-range\" and viral seasonality. Hence, we investigated the relationship between \"humidity-range\" and viral seasonality. It would be interesting to assess if a similar relationship is seen with other ranges such as \"temperature-range\", \"dew point-range\", etc in the future. Relationship with other variables appears to be virus specific. Therefore, we need models which can investigate multiple variables for each virus. Changes in weather, human behaviour and the immune system can all affect an agent's seasonality and are all interlinked, as seen in the decrease in vitamin D in temperate climates due to the decrease in daylight hours (shorter/cloudier days). This also makes it difficult to describe the effect of weather on viral seasonality in isolation. Finally, the GLM used in this study has some disadvantages. The GLM used does not account for the lag period between people becoming infected and then seeking medical help, and it also cannot model the multiple peaks seen for rhinoviruses. Furthermore, average data was used to calculate the GLM. This has led to some of the curves not being as smooth as when yearly data is analysed (for e.g. from 2011 a year when peaks were seen for all viruses ( Supplementary Fig. 1) ). The two steps seen in the curves correspond to the start and end date and probably reflect the lack of samples from January to March in 2009 and the month of December in 2015 as we have analysed data from April 2009 and November 2015. Despite this, the average data over the 6.5 years is very similar to that from 2011. This helps confirm the seasonality for most viruses. There may be differences in individual years as can be seen for adenovirus which had a peak seasonality in December in 2011.\n",
            " Nonetheless, our findings on temperature, humidity and \"humidity-range\" could potentially help explain the variation in seasonality between temperate and tropical regions of the world. IAV is known to occur throughout the year in South East Asian countries closer to the equator (warm, humid environment) 38 . The further you are from the equator, winter seasonality and or association with monsoon rains is notable 39, 40 . Our findings on \"humidity-ranges\" need confirmation in a tropical setting. The order of occurrence of different viruses in tropical and temperate regions needs to be investigated in relation to the parameters highlighted. Additionally, whether these peaks in viral activity change depending on the age of the population analysed could also be a topic for future research. In conclusion, non-enveloped viruses were present throughout the year. Enveloped viruses were more seasonal starting from IAV in January to RSV in December with other viruses in between. RSV, HPIV-3 and IAV and IBV showing the clearest patterns. RSV, IAV and IBV show a clear preference for colder temperature and dew point, as well as consistent humidity. In contrast, HPIV showed a preference for higher temperatures. Additionally, HPIV-3 demonstrated a significant tolerance to low humidity. Hence, meteorological factors like temperature, humidity and \"humidity-range\" have a significant effect on the incidence of the causative agents of the common cold and changes in meteorological factors could potentially predict the decline of one virus and the emergence of the next.\n",
            " Meteorological data. Following discussion with the Met Office, Edinburgh Gogarbank weather station, which captures data on an hourly basis, was identified as the most representative weather station for the catchment areas examined in this study. We downloaded meteorological data collected by the Edinburgh Gogarbank weather station from the Met Office Weather Observation Website. Hourly air temperature (°C), air pressure (hPa), relative humidity (%) dew point (°C), wind speed and daylight length measurements from 1 st April 2009 to the 30 th November 2015 were available. Small periods of weather data were missing in October 2011 and June 2015 (reasons unknown). We calculated means and ranges for each variable for each day. We also created weekly and monthly aggregations of the data. As rhinoviruses and HMPV testing only started from the 4 th of September 2009, results for these two agents were only available after this date.\n",
            " Virological Data. We collated anonymised virological results on all forms of respiratory samples (nose/throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavages, endotracheal aspirates, etc) tested at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. These included all samples from patients attending 8 hospitals around Edinburgh (Astley Ainslie Hospital, Chalmers Centre, Liberton Hospital, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Royal Victoria Hospital, Western General Hospital), and 126 primary care centres across in Edinburgh and Lothian, tested at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. We had results from 36,191 individual patients over the study period. Of these patients, 17,936 were male and 18,241 were female (information on gender was not available for 14). The age groups of the cohort are in Table 2 . PCR results were available for rhinovirus, adenovirus, IAV, IBV, HPIV 1-3, RSV and HMPV. There were no major modifications to the assay in that time. Rhinovirus and HMPV data was unavailable until screening commenced in September 2009. Between 16 th -24 th February 2011, samples were not tested for rhinovirus due to high work load. Between September 15 th and December 9 th 2010, IBV was not tested due to technical reasons. We removed repeat positive samples from the same individual collected within 14 days from analysis, resulting in a total of 52060 samples for analysis. We calculated the proportion of positive results (as %) for individual viruses for each day, to help compare results over time. We used daily data for statistical analysis to avoid loss of accuracy from averaging data. To identify seasonal trends, we plotted the proportion of positive results for each day against individual meteorological factors.\n",
            " Analysis. Univariate analysis of continuous variables (mean temperature, dew point, relative humidity, and the difference between maximum and minimum humidity in a day; \"humidity-range\") were compared between days where one or more samples were positive for a given virus, and days where no samples were positive for that virus using two-sample t-tests. To determine the impact of multiple factors, multivariable logistic regression was conducted using those variables with a univariate p-value of <0.1 in the t-test and models were built using the \"Enter (forced entry)\" method on SPSS. Due to the likelihood of collinearity affecting results because of the close relationship between dew point and temperature, dew point was removed from the logistic regression.\n",
            " An analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction with Tukey's range test were done, to determine if the mean temperature, dew point, pressure, relative humidity, and \"humidity-range\" at which individual viruses were present were different between viruses. This was performed in conjunction with post-hoc analysis.\n",
            " Finally, seasonality of individual viruses identified in our study was confirmed with a generalised linear model (GLM) based on temperature following the method of Naumova et al. 41 . The GLM was calculated using daily incidence of each virus, averaged over the entire study period.\n",

            "Title: Age-Dependent Glycomic Response to the 2009 Pandemic H1N1 Influenza Virus and Its Association with Disease Severity\n",
            "Body Text: Influenza A viruses cause a spectrum of responses from mild coldlike symptoms to severe respiratory illness and death. 1 Both viral strain and intrinsic host factors, such as age, influence disease severity. 2 In general, infants, young children, and individuals older than 65 are more likely to have severe clinical outcomes upon influenza infection. However, during pandemic outbreaks, influenza viral strains can emerge that shift the age-dependent infection patterns. In 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza strain (H1N1pdm09) arose that caused severe clinical symptoms more frequently in older children and adults than in young children and the elderly. 3 Although the lower severity observed in young children is not clearly understood, the loss of severity observed in the elderly population was attributed to pre-existing immunity. Prior waves of seasonal and pandemic influenza strains generated antibodies in the older exposed population that neutralized the H1N1pdm09 virus, generating a more productive existing immunity, which lessened severity.\n",
            " The ferret model of influenza mimics clinical outcomes for the H1N1pdm09 across the age spectrum. 4−6 Ferrets are an attractive animal model for influenza, as they share similar lung physiology to humans and recapitulate the pathology observed in clinical populations. In addition, human influenza viruses efficiently replicate in ferrets without the need for adaptation, enabling study of the original viral strains. 7 This is because ferrets contain the receptor for human influenza, α-2,6-sialic acids, in their upper respiratory tracts. The similarities between the glycans in the respiratory tract of ferrets to those observed in humans make this a good model to study glycomic changes in response to influenza infection. 8, 9 Glycosylation plays an important role in influenza infection and host response. 10, 11 Adhesion of viral hemagglutinin (HA) to host receptors containing terminal α-2,6-sialic acids located in the upper respiratory tract is the first step in the infection process. Release of viral particles requires viral neuraminidases (NA) to cleave sialic acids. 12 This enzyme is the target of current therapeutics against influenza. 13, 14 Because of the importance of HA, NA, and sialic acid in influenza biology, the majority of glycomic analysis has focused on these molecules.\n",
            " In recent work, our laboratory analyzed the glycomic response to H1N1pdm09 in an adult ferret population using our lectin microarray technology. 15 We found that the severity was not related to sialic acid levels but, rather, correlated with the expression of high mannose N-glycans. Histology on ferret lungs showed high mannose levels corresponded with alveolar severity and was present throughout the tissue on multiple cell types. Infection of human lung epithelia with H1N1pdm09 in cell culture recapitulated the increased high mannose observed in ferrets. This glycan signature was found to be cell surface and was upregulated on both viral and host glycoproteins. Expression of high mannose was shown to be downstream of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which has been shown to play a role in influenza severity. 16 This glycan motif is the recognition element for a number of innate lectins that activate the immune system. The complement-inducing lectin MBL2, which binds high mannose, has been strongly associated with influenza severity. 17, 18 We have shown direct, high mannose-dependent binding of MBL2 to influenza infected cells. On the basis of our work we hypothesize that high mannose, induced via the UPR pathway, may play a causative role in the damage associated with MBL2 in influenza. It is unknown whether this mechanism might underlie age-related differences in severity.\n",
            " In this work, we examine glycomic changes, including high mannose, upon infection with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 strain of influenza in ferret models of young children and the elderly. Since their introduction in 2005, 19 lectin microarrays have been used to perform glycomic analysis on a wide variety of samples from microvesicles 20 to human tissues. 21 Herein, we analyze the glycomic response to H1N1pdm09 infection in newly weaned and aged ferrets using our dual-color lectin microarray technology. 22 We also compare the baseline glycomes of newly weaned, adult, and aged ferrets. Our data suggest that differences in the glycome, in particular, in the high mannose response, may help explain in part the variation in clinical outcomes as a function of age in influenza infection.\n",
            " Fitch ferrets (Mustela putorius f uro, female) were obtained from Triple F Farms (Sayre, PA) and verified as negative for antibodies to circulating influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses. Newly weaned ferrets were defined as 6−7 weeks of age, adult ferrets as 6−12 months of age, and aged ferrets as 5.5−7 years of age. Ferrets were pair-housed in stainless steel cages (Shor-Line) containing Sani-Chips laboratory animal bedding (P.J. Murphy Forest Products) and provided with food and fresh water ad libitum. Newly weaned and adult ferrets were administered intranasally the H1N1pdm09 virus, A/California/07/2009 (Influenza Reagents Resources (IRR), BEI Resources, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) at a dose of 10 6 PFU. Aged ferrets were infected at a dose of 10 5 PFU. The animals were monitored daily for weight loss and disease symptoms, including elevated temperature, low activity level, sneezing, and nasal discharge. Animals were randomly assigned to be sacrificed at day 1, 3, 5, 8, or 14 postinfection (DPI) or euthanized if their clinical condition (e.g., loss of >20% body weight) required it.\n",
            " Necropsies were performed to collect lung tissue. Lungs were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), and the right upper and lower lung lobes were removed. Each lobe was sectioned into quadrants and snap frozen prior to preparation for lectin microarray analysis.\n",
            " The severity of the infection was determined for all animals studied who were sacrificed at day 8 postinfection. We analyzed two different metrics: weight loss and pneumonia composite score (PCS). In both cases, we determined the cutoffs for mild, moderate, and severe by quartile, wherein mild = Q0-Q1, moderate = Q1-Q3, and severe = Q3-Q4. Weight loss cutoffs for adult ferrets: mild (weight loss <10.8%), moderate (weight loss: 10.8%−16.5%), and severe (weight loss >16.5%). Cutoffs for aged ferrets: mild (weight loss <18.3%), moderate (weight loss: 18.3%−21.9%), and severe (weight loss >21.9%). PCS cutoffs for newly weaned ferrets: mild (PCS < 8. \n",

            " Clinical outcomes and susceptibility to influenza infection vary with age. 25, 26 Given the role host glycans play in influenza infection and in the immune response, we characterized the baseline glycosylation in the lungs of uninfected female ferrets from three age categories: newly weaned, adult, and aged. Newly weaned ferrets were defined as those from six to seven weeks of age. The course of H1N1pdm09 infection in this ferret population mirrors that observed clinically in young children, that is, a mild to moderate presentation of symptoms. 5 Adult ferrets, defined as 6−12 months of age, have more varied responses to H1N1pdm09 infection ranging from mild to severe, again in line with human populations. 4 In aged ferrets, defined as 5.5−7 years of age, severe outcomes are seen in more than 50% of animals infected with H1N1pdm09. 6 This is in line with the higher severity seen in aged populations from influenza A infections in general. 29, 30 However, it does not match clinical observations in the aged human population for the H1N1pdm09 strain. This difference is accounted for by pre-existing immunity in the aged human population. Infection by earlier pandemic-like H1N1 viruses is thought to have elicited cross-reactive antibodies that neutralized the virus, moderating the severity of H1N1pdm09 in the older population. 27, 28 In contrast, the aged ferrets in our study are a naive population with no pre-exposure to influenza. Thus, we observe the more severe influenza response typical of influenza A infections in the elderly with no preimmunity. We analyzed the baseline expression level of host glycans prior to influenza virus infection in lung punch biopsies from newly weaned (NW, n = 6), adult (AD, n = 4), and aged ferrets (AG, n = 3) using our dual-color lectin microarray technology (Scheme 1). 22, 23 Biopsies from both the upper and lower lobes were analyzed for each ferret. Lectin microarrays utilize carbohydrate-binding proteins with well-defined specificities to detect glycan changes between samples. 19,22−24 In brief, frozen tissue samples were sonicated and labeled with either Alexa Fluor 555-NHS (sample) or Alexa Fluor 647-NHS (reference). A pooled reference consisting of all the samples was used. Equal amounts of sample and reference were analyzed on the lectin microarrays (>100 probes, Supporting Information, Table S1 ). A heatmap of the normalized data, ordered by ferret age, is shown in Figure 1a .\n",
            " Sialic acid glycoconjugates on the host cell surface play a crucial role as both the receptor for influenza binding by hemagglutinin (α-2,6-sialosides) and as the target of the influenza neuraminidase (α-2,3-and α-2,6-sialosides). Differences in sialoside levels may play a role in differential susceptibility to the virus with age. In light of this we examined the expression level of α-2,3and α-2,6-sialosides in the ferret lung. Both newly weaned and aged ferret lungs had higher levels of α-2,6-sialosides than adult lungs (lectins: SNA, TJA-I, ∼1.3-fold NW/AD, ∼1.4-fold AG/AD, Figure 1b and Supporting Information, Figure S1 ), indicating that they may be more susceptible to viral infection. In contrast to α-2,6-sialic acid, we observed a significant age-dependent decrease in α-2,3-sialosides (lectin: MAL-II (∼1.5-fold NW/AD, ∼2-fold NW/AG), SLBR-N, 31 diCBM40, SLBR-H, 31 Figure 1c and Supporting Information, Figure S2 ). Of particular note, the lectin MAL-II mainly recognizes α-2,3-sialic acids on O-linked glycans. These glycans commonly decorate proteins such as mucins, whose heavily sialylated structures often act as a trap for viral particles. 32 While a decrease in α-2,3-sialosides is observed with age, we also observed an increase in mucin levels in the lungs (Antibodies: MUC5AC, MUC15, Supporting Information, Figure S3 ). In addition, we observed a potentially related increase in Lewis structures (Le), which often decorate mucins (Antibodies: Le b , Le X , Le Y , Supporting Information, Figure S4 ). Taken together, our data suggest that the protective, highly sialylated mucins, 33−35 which allow clearance of the virus from the lungs, may alter with age in a way that diminishes their protective capacity. These data correlate well with the differences in viral clearance observed in these ferrets, with young ferrets showing more rapid clearance and aged ferrets showing prolonged infection and lower clearance of the virus upon infection. 6 Recently, our group identified high mannose as a severity marker for influenza H1N1pdm09 infection in adult ferrets. 15 High mannose (defined here as Man 7−9 ) and oligo-mannose (defined as Man 5−7 ) are targets for innate immune lectin binding and may play a direct role in the damage observed in influenza. Analysis of the mannose binding lectins on the array showed distinct profiles for levels of high-and oligomannose. 36 Uninfected newly weaned animals had significantly lower levels of oligo-mannose (GNL, NPA, HHL) than either adult or aged ferrets (Figure 1d and Supporting Information, Figure S5 ). However, high-mannose levels, recognized by the antiviral lectin Griffithsin (GRFT), 37 were higher in the newly weaned and adult animals as compared to the aged ferrets. Whether age-dependent differences in the baseline levels of Journal of Proteome Research pubs.acs.org/jpr Article mannose in uninfected animals have any bearing on the levels induced during host response to influenza is currently unclear.\n",
            " Disease progression in adult and aged ferrets infected with H1N1pdm09 differs dramatically in timing and presentation. 6 Aged ferrets had more persistent viral infections and were unable to clear the virus by day 8 postinfection, in contrast to adults. They also developed pneumonia later in the course of their illness and had higher rates of mortality. To study the impact of glycosylation on the host response to influenza in the aged population, we performed lectin microarray analysis on lung punch biopsies from infected aged ferrets (age >5.5 Journal of Proteome Research pubs.acs.org/jpr Article years). We performed two concurrent studies: a severity study at day 8 postinfection (dpi 8, n = 29 ferrets) and a time-course analysis that included the day 8 samples (dpi 1: n = 5; dpi 3: n = 7; dpi 5: n = 12 ferrets, Scheme 2). Uninfected aged ferrets were used as a control (n = 3 ferrets). We analyzed two samples for each ferret.\n",
            " The animals analyzed in this study were the same animals for which pathology data were obtained in Bissel et al. 6 In our previous work, weight loss was used to evaluate the severity of illness. 6, 15 This is a common metric for severity in animal models and can only be used for time points at more than 5 d postinfection. In studying the disease progression in aged ferrets we observed a disparity between the pathology and the weight loss data. In this age group, a severe outcome by weight loss was defined as greater than 20% loss of mass. 6 A pneumonia composite score, which sums the scores for lung involvement, bronchial severity, and alveolar severity, was used to evaluate severity by pathology. 6 In aged animals, which present with pneumonia at later stages of infection, degree of severity by pathology cannot be determined for early time points. A comparison of the severity as defined by weight loss quartiles (Q0-Q1: <18.3%, Q1-Q3: 18.3%−21.9%, Q3-Q4: >21.9%, Supporting Information, Figure S6 ) to the pneumonia composite scores at day 8 showed no concordance between the two metrics. Instead, in the aged population the trend was toward lower weight loss with increased severity by pathology. This is in direct opposition to the trend observed in adult ferrets. On the basis of our analysis, weight loss was not an appropriate metric for severity in aged ferrets. Thus, the pneumonia composite score was used as the severity metric for this cohort, as it represents the physiologically relevant degree of illness in influenza infection. We used quartiles to define mild, moderate, and severe infections in the aged population (Mild: PCS < 8.5, n = 6 ferrets; Moderate: PCS = 8.5−11, n = 15; Severe: PCS > 11, n = 8). A heat map of the normalized data for ferrets sacrificed at day 7−8 postinfection arranged by severity is presented in Figure 2 . A heat map of the time-course analysis for aged ferrets is shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S7 .\n",
            " We observed several changes in aged ferrets as a function of infection that did not overlay onto severity. For ease of comparison between the aged and adult host responses, we reanalyzed the lectin microarray data from our adult ferret cohort 15 using PCS as the severity metric. In our previous work, adult ferrets showed an increase in α-2,6 sialylation at early infection time points, with levels returning to baseline by day 8 postinfection. In contrast, we see a significant loss of α-2,6 sialylation in the aged ferret lungs with this loss occurring early in the course of infection (SNA, TJA-I, Figure 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S8) . We also observe a loss in α-2,3-sialosides by day 8 postinfection in aged animals (SLBR-B, SLBR-H, SLBR-N, diCBM-40, MAL-I, MAL-II, Figure 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S9) . A similar loss of α-2,3-sialosides was observed in the adult ferrets. However, in this population, the response was immediate, while in the aged animals a more gradual loss of this glycan was observed. Influenza neuraminidases are known to prefer α-2,3-sialosides, 38, 39 and the more gradual loss of this glycan in aged ferrets maps onto the pattern of delayed infection observed in the lungs. 6 Uninfected aged animals had higher levels of nonsialylated mucins compared to adults. Upon infection, we observed a substantial loss of O-linked glycans, Lewis structures, and mucins in aged ferrets (AIA, HAA, HPA, MPA, MNA-G, Mucin 15, Le a , Le b , Le Y , Figure 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S10 ). This is similar to previous observations made in adult ferrets; however, the degree of response in the aged ferrets was more pronounced. We observed a strong loss of Olinked glycans, Lewis structures, and mucins at the earliest time points (Supporting Information, Figure S11 ), which may contribute to the inability of older animals to effectively fight infection.\n",
            " Our recent work strongly suggests a role for high/oligomannose as a key mediator of influenza severity. 15 In our original analysis, the severity in the adult ferrets was defined by weight loss. Reanalysis of these data using pneumonia composite scores did not change the previously observed relationship between the high/oligo-mannose levels and severity (Supporting Information, Figure S12 ). We observe a similar increase in high mannose as a function of severity in the aged animals when severity is defined by pathology (GRFT, HHL, H84T, 40 NPA, GNA, ASA, Figure 2 , Figure 3 , and Supporting Information, Figure S12 ). However, the timing of high mannose induction in the aged ferrets is delayed when compared to adults. In the adult ferrets, high mannose was induced at day 1 postinfection in line with the damage observed by pathology. 6 In the aged ferrets, we observe significant changes in high mannose by day 3, which persisted to day 8 postinfection. This is consistent with the more delayed development of pneumonia in these animals. Overall, these data support high mannose as a marker and potential mediator of severity in the host response to influenza infection. The 2019 pandemic H1N1 virus presented with mild clinical symptoms in young children. 41−43 H1N1pdm09 infection in newly weaned ferrets mimic these clinical symptoms, with lower fevers and less weight loss. 5 Newly weaned ferrets clear the virus faster and have much lower levels of alveolar pneumonia. 6 We analyzed the glycosylation changes in the lungs of newly weaned ferrets (six to seven weeks) infected with H1N1pdm09, for which we had previously obtained pathology data. 6 To examine the changes in glycosylation over the course of the infection, we performed a time-course study (uninfected, n = 16; dpi 3, n = 4; dpi 5, n = 4; dpi 8, n = 42; dpi 14, n = 3, two samples per ferret). Severity was determined for day 8 samples using the PCS metric as previously described. A heat map of the time-course data, organized by severity for day 8 postinfection, is shown in Figure 4 . In contrast to both adults and aged ferrets, we saw no clear severity-dependent differences in the newly weaned animals at day 8 postinfection. We did observe an increase in complex Nglycan epitopes early in the course of infection, peaking by day 5 and returning to preinfection levels by day 8 (α-2,6-sialic acid: SNA; core fucose: LcH, PSA; bisecting branching: PHA-E, Calsepa, Figure 4 and Supporting Information, Figure S13 ). Although high/oligo-mannose trended with complex Nglycans in the time course, the changes were not statistically significant. Overall, the lack of strong changes in the glycome is consistent with the mild nature of illness observed in young ferrets, modeling the human population.\n",
            " In 2009, a new pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus emerged and displayed an unusual severity pattern, impacting adults more severely than young children or the elderly. The lower impact on the elderly population, who are typically at high risk for influenza severity, was later determined to be a result of preexisting immunity. The ferret model of influenza has been found to mimic the differences in age-dependent illness observed in the absence of pre-existing immunity. In this model, there is a gradient of severity with young ferrets showing mild illness and aged ferrets displaying high severity, as would be expected in an influenza-naive aged human population. The origins of this disparity in host response is still unclear. In this work, we show dramatic age-dependent differences in the ferret glycome and host response to influenza that overlay differences observed in severity. These include age-dependent differences in mucin-related epitopes that may explain differences in viral clearance observed between populations. In recent work, we posited that the induction of high mannose due to influenza infection could be causative of severity through overengagement of the innate immune system via lectins, such as MBL2. Our current study shows that high mannose is induced in the aged population, where high levels of severity are observed, but not in newly weaned ferrets, which display a mild phenotype. This is consistent with our current hypothesis and points to the need for further study to determine if the glycomic host response is a critical mediator of influenza severity. . Newly weaned ferrets undergo glycan changes early in response to influenza. Median normalized log 2 ratios (Sample (S)/Reference(R)) of newly weaned (six to seven weeks of age) ferret lung samples were ordered by days post infection. Uninfected (blue), n = 16, two samples per ferret; day 3 (salmon), n = 4, two samples per ferret; day 5 (magenta), n = 4, two samples per ferret; day 8, ordered by severity (mild, yellow; moderate, orange; severe, red), n = 42, two samples per ferret; day 14 (maroon), n = 3, two samples per ferret.

            "Title: The Record-breaking Meiyu in 2020 and Associated Atmospheric Circulation and Tropical SST Anomalies\n",
            "Body Text: The major rainy season of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), known as meiyu in China (Tao and Chen, 1987) , Baiu in Japan (Saito, 1985; Ninomiya and Murakami, 1987) , and Changma in South Korea (Oh et al., 1997) , is caused by a quasi-stationary rainbelt in early sum-mer (mid-June to mid-July) which brings abundant rainfall that accounts for most of the annual precipitation in China, Japan, and South Korea (Ding, 1992; Ding and Chan, 2005) . As a critical supplier of water resources, the onset, duration, and intensity of the meiyu season exert enormous impacts on socio-economic development and human life over the densely populated regions in East Asia. Thus, advancing our understanding of the critical factors controlling the meiyu variations is of great importance to improving the fidelity of meiyu prediction and thus reducing the related dis-asters.\n",
            " All the major components of EASM, such as the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), the South Asian high, the upper-level East Asian westerly jet stream, and the lowlevel southwesterly jet, may affect EASM rainfall patterns and meiyu activity (Tao and Chen, 1987; Ninomiya and Shibagaki, 2007; Sampe and Xie, 2010; Liu et al., 2019b; Ding et al., 2020) . The northward progression of the East Asian westerly jet stream over East Asia in June can be seen as an early sign of the meiyu onset (Li et al., 2004) . The location and intensity of WPSH play an important role in setting the stage for flood and drought events in the Yangtze-Huaihe River valley (YHRV, Liu et al., 2012) . The moisture transport which is regulated by the low-level southwesterly jet along the edge of the WPSH can affect the intensity of meiyu rainfall (He et al., 2007) .\n",
            " Meiyu characteristics (intensity, onset, retreat, and duration) exhibit significant interannual variations, which depend not only on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the Indian Ocean (Wu and Liu, 1995; Wu et al., , 2000 Wu et al., , 2003 Zhou and Wang, 2006; Kosaka et al., 2011; Zhou, 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2019a) , but also on the middle to high latitude wave trains over the Eurasian continent (Hsu and Lin, 2007) . On sub-seasonal timescales, both the intraseasonal oscillation of 30−60 days (ISO) and the quasi-biweekly oscillation of 10−20 days (QBWO) are critical factors that affect the meiyu activity (Ding and Liu, 2008; Chen et al., 2015; Song et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2020) . The QBWO is more active during those years which have heavier rainfall attributed to meiyu compared to normal years (Mao and Wu, 2005; Ouyang and Liu, 2020) . The QBWO is evident in multiple meteorological variables of the EASM region (Yang et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2020) . The northwestward-propagating QBWO affects the summer rainfall of East China (Chen et al., 2015) .\n",
            " In the summer of 2020, the YHRV experienced an extreme meiyu rainfall season that featured an earlier onset and a delayed retreat, as well as unusually intense and persistent rainfall events (Liu and Ding, 2020) . The accumulated precipitation in the 2020 meiyu season broke the historical record since 1961 and caused the worst flooding in the YHRV in recent decades with more than 140 dead or missing and $11.75 billion of economic losses by mid-July (Gan, 2020) . The other two especially intense meiyu rainfall seasons in the YHRV took place in 1998 and 2016 following super El Niño events, along with significant ISO and QBWO activities (Huang et al., 1998; Zhu et al., 2003; Mao and Wu, 2005; Shao et al., 2018) . However, 2020 followed a weak central Pacific El Niño, and its influence was expected to be different from that of super El Niños (Feng and Li, 2011; Hu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2020) . Thus, it is necessary to answer the following questions: what causes this record-breaking meiyu in the absence of a significant ENSO? How are the ISO or QBWO activities related and what is the nature of their impacts? What is the role played by the warming of the tropical Indian Ocean?\n",
            " The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the datasets and methods used in this study. The characteristics of this record-breaking meiyu, possible factors, and tropical SST forcing are analyzed in sections 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Section 6 is a summary and discussion.\n",
            " The main datasets utilized in this work include: (1) The daily precipitation observation data from 2,400 stations nationwide provided by the National Meteorological Information Center of China, (2) Atmospheric reanalysis data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) of the U. S. with a horizontal resolution of 2.5° × 2.5° (Kalnay et al., 1996) , (3) The extended and reconstructed monthly mean SST produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (ERSSTv5; with a spatial resolution of 2° × 2°, (4) The basic information about the meiyu season was provided by the National Climate Center of China, including the time of onset and retreat, the duration, and the total precipitation of meiyu. The meiyu in China is mainly located over YHRV, within the area bounded by 28°-34°N and 110°-122.5°E (Fig. 1b) . The present study focuses on the meiyu season (around June and July) covering the 1961-2020 period. Anomalies of all variables are defined as deviations from the climatological mean of the period 1981-2010.\n",
            " To measure the tropical SSTA variations and their association with the atmosphere and the extreme meiyu in 2020, we use the Niño3.4 and IOBM indices to represent the roles of ENSO and the tropical Indian Ocean SST anomaly, respectively. The Niño3.4 index is defined as the averaged SSTA in the region (5°S-5°N, 120°-170°W), and the IOBM index (Chambers et al., 1999) is the averaged SSTA in the region (20°S-20°N, 40°-110°E). The linear trends of these SST indices have been removed before calculating the correlation and reconstruction of the rainfall anomaly in the YHRV using these SST indices.\n",
            " The statistical significance of the correlation is estimated by using the two-tailed Student's t-test. For the meiyu of 1961-2020, the correlation coefficients at the confidence levels of 90%, 95%, and 99% are 0.22, 0.26, and 0.33, respectively. The method of partial correlation is used to exclude the possible influence dominated by any particular factor (Sankar-Rao et al., 1996, Behera and Yamagata, 2003) . The second-order Butterworth band-pass filter (Svalgaard et al., 2005) is used to extract the component of QBWO in this study, which is a common method for separating signals of different scales.\n",
            " In 2020, meiyu onset was observed on 1 June, seven days earlier than normal. The meiyu retreat occurred on 2 August, 15 days later than normal. The meiyu season lasted for 62 days, which was among one of the longest duration events since 1961 and of the same duration as 2015. The meiyu accumulated precipitation reached 759.2 mm which broke the record dating back to 1961 (Fig. 1a) . The spatial distribution of rainfall and its anomaly during the meiyu season in 2020 is shown in Fig.1b . The accumulated precipitation amount in the YHRV tended to be greater than 400 mm, and above 800 mm along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, with the maximum center having precipitation amounts that exceeded 1,200 mm (Fig. 1b) . Correspondingly, the precipitation amount was 200−800 mm above the climatological mean in most areas of YHRV, and more than twice the climatological mean in some areas (Fig. 1b) , which exceeded the amounts observed during the same period in 1998 and 2016 (Huang et al., 1998; Yuan et al., 2017) . During the meiyu season, there were 10 heavy rainfall processes (defined as severe weather events with observed precipitation exceeding 50 mm d −1 and the duration lasting no less than three days) occurring over the YHRV, with high overlap and significant extremes (Chen et al., 2020) . 18 national meteorological stations in Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan Provinces broke their historical extreme records for daily precipitation. Figure 2 shows the daily evolution of the main rainbelt over eastern China during the meiyu season in 2020. It is shown that the meiyu onset occurred south of YHRV before the rainbelt withdrew into southern China (south of 25°N). Then the meiyu rainbelt had rapidly moved northward beginning 9 June and occupied most of the YHRV region during 10-16 June. Subsequently, the heavy rainfall occurred repeatedly over the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and persisted for a long time, with a slight north-south oscillation. As a result, the meiyu rainbelt spanned a wide meridional range. The duration of rainfall was 21 days in Hefei, Anhui Province, and 25 days in Anyi, Jiangxi Province, which broke their historical records (figure not shown). Coincident with the weakening of the rainfall intensity over the YHRV and the northward shift of the main rainbelt into North China, the meiyu season concluded at the end of July. Overall, the meiyu season in 2020 featured an early onset, a delayed retreat, a long duration, a wide rainbelt, and multiple heavy rainfall processes, especially the stepwise oscillation of the meiyu rainbelt on the sub-seasonal timescale. To reveal the possible reasons for such a record-breaking meiyu season in 2020, we investigate the variations of the large-scale atmospheric circulation systems in the next section.\n",
            " during the meiyu season of 2020 4.1. The western Pacific subtropical high\n",
            " The location of the summer rainbelt over eastern China is largely determined by the location of the WPSH (Liu et al., 2012 (Liu et al., , 2019b . Two significant northward jumps of the WPSH occur around mid-June and mid-July which corresponded to the onset and retreat of the meiyu season, respectively (Tao and Wei, 2006; Su and Xue, 2011) . When the WPSH ridgeline lies within the range of 18°-26°N, it is con-ducive to the occurrence and persistence of the meiyu in the YHRV (Niu et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2013) . During the meiyu season in 2020, the WPSH ridgeline showed significant QBWO features and experienced six northward jumps and southward withdrawals which occurred in stages (Fig. 3) and corresponded to the location of the meiyu rainbelt (heavy rainfall area) in eastern China (Fig. 2) . The first northward jump of the WPSH occurred around 30 May. The WPSH ridgeline crossed 18°N on 1 June, resulting in an early onset of the meiyu over the southern part of the YHRV. After a brief southward withdrawal, the WPSH rapidly jumped northward again, to the north of 20°N, around 8 June, prompting the entire YHRV to enter the meiyu season on 9 June. The two northward jumps of the WPSH occurred much earlier than in previous years, and the amplitude of the QBWO was intensified, which is one of the factors accounting for the early onset of the 2020 meiyu season.\n",
            " The WPSH jumped northward for the third time on 24 June and oscillated between 20°-23°N from 25 June to 10 July. During this period, the amplitude of QBWO was relatively small, which provided favorable circulation conditions for the persistent heavy rainfall along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In mid-July, the WPSH fluctuated twice and the corresponding rainbelt in the YHRV also showed a noticeable meridional swing. During 28-31 July, the WPSH significantly jumped northward, to the north of 26°N, for the sixth time. As a result, the summer monsoon rainbelt moved northward into North China, and the meiyu season came to an end after persisting for two months.\n",
            " The evolution of the WPSH meridional location is a key atmospheric circulation factor that led to the persistent extreme meiyu season in 2020. The WPSH displayed obvious QBWO-like periodic variations, with six northward jumps and southward withdrawals that occurred in stages. These jumps and withdrawals were closely related to the onset and retreat of the meiyu season, as well as the northward shift and stagnation of the meiyu rainbelt.\n",
            " The low-level southwesterly jet was active over South China and included five intensified northward extensions, corresponding to the QBWO which occurred along with the meridional movement of the WPSH during the meiyu season in 2020 (Fig. 4a) . The formation of each strong southerly wind center and the associated convergence on its northern side can provide favorable dynamic conditions for the heavy rainfall in the lower troposphere. With multiple intensifications of the southwesterly jet, the corresponding convergence present on the northern side of the jet occurred repetitively (Fig. 4a) , leading to the heavy rainfall processes. Furthermore, the low-level jet transported heat and moisture from the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the South China Sea into the YHRV (Figure not shown) , providing further support for the formation of the meiyu rainfall (He et al., 2007) .\n",
            " The periodic intensification of the low-level southwesterly jet, the repeated formation of strong southerly wind centers over relatively stable locations, led to intensified water vapor transport, low-level convergence, and repeated ascent over the YHRV. As a result, the meiyu persisted for a long time, accompanied by the frequent occurrence of heavy rainfall processes.\n",
            " The rapid northward jump of the South Asia High (SAH) is an early signal indicating the onset of the meiyu season. The location and intensity of the upper-level East Asian westerly jet north of the SAH is closely related to the meiyu rainfall (Zhang and Tao, 1999) . Consistent with the variation of the atmospheric circulation systems in the lower and middle troposphere, the East Asian westerly jet experienced five alterations characterized by strengthening with northward shift and weakening with southward withdrawal, both occurring within a relatively stable location during the meiyu season in 2020 (Fig. 4b) . The SAH ridgeline was located between 20°-23°N before early June, corresponding to the meiyu onset in the southern YHRV. After that, the westerly jet axis and the SAH ridgeline moved northward and stabilized around 37°-40°N and 26°-28°N, respectively. Under the combined influence of the relatively stable upper-level westerly jet stream and the SAH, the significant upper-level divergence was located to the south of the upper-level westerly jet axis and north of the SAH ridgeline, which is conducive to the development of vertical ascending motions and the formation of the meiyu rainbelt over the YHRV. Consequently, the multiple intensifications of the upper-level westerly jet stream corresponded to the occurrence of heavy rainfall in the YHRV.\n",
            " It is suggested that the periodic enhancement of the upper-level westerly jet stream and the relatively stable location of SAH represent yet another two important atmospheric circulation factors that accounted for the extremely long meiyu duration in 2020. Moreover, the meridional movement of the SAH and the intensification of the upper-level westerly jet on its northern side seemed to occur 1-3 days before the northward jump of the WPSH and the establishment of low-level southerly centers (Figs. 3, 4a) . This finding suggests that the East Asian summer monsoon circulation evolves from the upper to the lower troposphere, and the anomalous variation in the upper-level atmospheric circulations may be precursors of the evolution of the meiyu season.\n",
            " The blocking high is a major atmospheric circulation sys- tem in the middle to high latitudes. The long-term persistence of a blocking high brings about persistent weather and climate anomalies (Tibaldi and Molteni, 1990) . The meiyu rainfall is the product of the interaction between the East Asian summer monsoon system and the Eurasian circulation system in the middle to high latitudes, including blocking high systems (Niu et al., 2009) . During the meiyu season in 2020, both the Okhotsk blocking high (eastern blocking) and the Ural blocking high (western blocking) were strong, and the Okhotsk blocking high was observed to be more stable and stronger than the Ural blocking high which is located further westward (Fig. 5) .\n",
            " Coincident with the two blocking highs, the Eurasian geopotential height field at the 500-hPa level (Z500) featured two ridges and one trough in the middle and high latitudes during the 2020 meiyu season (Fig. 6) . The two ridges were located over and to the west of the Ural Mountains and over the Okhotsk Sea extending to the Arctic region, respectively. The trough lied near the Balkhash Lake region with a wide meridional range, which enables the cold air from the high-latitudes to move southward along the northwesterly pathway (polar path) and thus affects eastern China. Cold air activities, which can be seen as one of the important factors leading to the persistent heavy rainfall, not only facilitate the convergence and uplift at the lower levels but also enhance the convective instability (Yao and Yu, 2005) .\n",
            " Also, there was another low trough along the coast of East Asia, accompanied by its negative geopotential height Fig. 4 . Time-latitude cross-section of (a) the 850 hPa meridional wind (contours, >1 m s −1 ) and southwesterly wind (vectors, m s −1 ), and divergence of the vertically integrated water vapor transport from the surface to 300 hPa (shading, 10 −5 kg m −2 s −1 ); and (b) the geopotential height (black dashed lines, gpm), zonal wind (thin blue solid lines, m s −1 ), and horizontal divergence (shading, 10 −6 s −1 ) along 110°-122.5°E at 200 hPa level during the 2020 meiyu season. The red solid line in (b) is the latitude of the ridgeline of South Asian high. The number at the top of (a) and (b) indicate five establishment and strengthening processes of the lowlevel southerly centers, and five strengthening processes of the East Asian upper-level westerly jet, respectively.\n",
            " anomaly. This implies that the cold air activities also frequently went southward through the northeasterly pathway (ultra-polar path), which is associated with the Okhotsk blocking high. Extreme meiyu rain events occurred when frequent cold air intrusions collide with the warm moist air entrenched over the YHRV.\n",
            " The extreme meiyu in 2020 occurred in the background of the decay phase of a weak El Niño event (Liu et al., 2020) . However, the 2020 meiyu was much stronger than those in 1998 and 2016 which both occurred under the influence of a super El Niño (Huang et al., 1998; Yuan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019) . As shown by the monthly variation of Niño3.4 index (Fig. 7) , the equatorial central and eastern Pacific Ocean experienced a weak warming event from October 2019 to April 2020, and then returned to a neutral state beginning May 2020, with Niño3.4 indices of −0.27, −0.35, and −0.34 in May-July 2020, respectively. On the other hand, positive SST anomalies were observed in the tropical Indian Ocean basin, reaching a peak in January 2020 (Fig. 7) . Previous studies have demonstrated that following an El Niño event, a basin-wide warming usually takes place over the tropical Indian Ocean that peaks in late boreal winter and early spring and persists through boreal summer (Chambers et al., 1999) . The warming of the tropical Indian Ocean plays an important \"relay \" role in maintaining the impact of the El Niño event on the climate of East Asia (Wu and Kirtman, 2004; Annamalai et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2009 ). While 2020, followed a weak El Niño event, the extreme warming in the Indian Ocean induced robust East Asian climate anomalies during June-July, evidenced by the standard deviation of the detrended IOBM index standing at 1.53, which ranks as the third-highest value since 1961 (Fig. 8) . This may imply that in addition to the response to the El Niño, local atmosphereocean interaction amplified the warming in the Indian Ocean in 2020.\n",
            " To explore the effect of the warming in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans on East Asian circulation anomalies and precipitation anomalies over the YHRV during the meiyu season, we present the partial correlations of the Niño3.4 and IOBM indices with atmospheric circulation anomalies in the middle and lower troposphere, as well as the SSTA in Fig. 9 . The partial correlations of SSTA with the Niño3.4 and IOBM indices show that the Niño3.4 and IOBM indices are relatively independent of each other in the spatial pattern during June-July ( Fig. 9a and 9b) , with a correlation coefficient of 0.23, which falls short of the 95% confidence level. As for the atmospheric circulation anomalies, the tropical Indian Ocean warming is accompanied by a positive-negative-positive, EAP/PJ-like teleconnection pattern over East Asia (Fig. 9c) , which is favorable for an intensified and southerly displaced WPSH, and abundant rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (Nitta, 1987; Nitta and Hu, 1996; Huang, 2004) . Also, the Eurasian circulation in the middle and high latitudes associated with the IOBM warming features two ridges and one trough, similar to the observation in 2020 (Fig. 6) . However, according to the correlations shown in Fig. 9d , accompanied by the observed negative Niño3.4 index during June and July 2020, the positive center of the geopotential height anomaly is located over eastern China (Fig. 9d) , further northwestward than that of IOBM index (Fig. 9c) . Such an anomalous circulation pattern is conducive to the northward shift of the WPSH, different from the observations in 2020 (Fig. 6) . Thus, compared with the Pacific Ocean, the persistent warming of the tropical Indian Ocean may be a more important factor in this flooding event.\n",
            " To further verify the contributions of SSTAs in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans to the meiyu rainfall in 2020, linear regression is used to reconstruct the meiyu anomaly over the YHRV in June-July 2020. First, the rainfall anomalies at each station are regressed onto the Niño3.4 and IOBM indices. Then, the linear regression coefficients are multiplied by corresponding values of each of the two indices in June-July 2020 to reconstruct rainfall anomalies in the meiyu season. The observed pattern with excessive rainfall over the YHRV and deficit rainfall in North China is reproduced by the IOBM index (Fig. 10a) , while the nearly opposite distribution of rainfall anomalies is obtained in the reconstruction using the Niño3.4 index (Fig. 10b) . Thus, from the statistical correlations and the reconstructions, it is suggested that the persistent warming in the tropical Indian Ocean, rather than the SST anomaly in the tropical central and eastern Pacific, may have played a key role in leading to the extreme meiyu in 2020. Nevertheless, the reconstructed rainfall anomaly based on the IOBM index is only about one-fourth of the observed rainfall anomaly during the meiyu season in 2020, which further implies that there may be other factors, operating on multiple timescales, that contributed to the record-breaking meiyu rainfall in 2020. For example, it might be partially attributed to the effects of global warming, which is known to have the potential to increase heavy rainfall around the YHRV during the meiyu season (Zhu et al., 2012) .\n",
            " Meiyu in China is the primary component of the East Asian rainy season. Based on observations and statistical analysis, this study investigated the record-breaking meiyu in 2020 and its possible causes associated with both the atmospheric circulation patterns and SSTA in the tropics. The record-breaking meiyu over the YHRV in 2020 was characterized by an early onset, a delayed retreat, a long duration, a wide meridional rainbelt, abundant precipitation, and fre- Fig. 6 .

In Fig. 6b , the isoline of 5840 represents the latitudinal position of the cold air in eastern China, and the number at the top of the figure indicates five cold air processes over eastern China. quent heavy rainstorm events.\n",
            " It is noted that the East Asian monsoon circulation system featured significant QBWO during the meiyu season of 2020. The onset and retreat of meiyu, the northward shift and stagnation of the rainbelt, and the occurrence and persistence of heavy rainstorm processes had a close connection with the QBWO variations. During the 2020 meiyu season, the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) experienced six periodic oscillations with northward advancements and southward retreats. Meanwhile, other monsoon circulation subsystems, including the East Asian westerly jet in the upper levels and the southwesterly jet in the lower levels were intensified on five occasions, corresponding with the QBWO. Especially noteworthy was the repeated establishment of the large southerly center with a relatively stable latitude range, which strengthened water vapor transport from the tropics. The moisture convergence and ascending motions developed repeatedly, leading to the long-term, persistent meiyu rainfall in the YHRV accompanied by frequent occurrences of extreme rainstorm processes.\n",
            " Moreover, two blocking highs persisted in the mid-high-latitudes over Eurasia, along with a major trough near the Balkhash Lake region. The combination of these features encouraged cold Arctic air to frequently flow into the YHRV. Furthermore, the trough along the East Asian coast was also active. The relative position of both of these troughs was conducive to frequent cold air intrusions moving southward through the northwestern and/or northeastern path before merging with the warm and moist airmass from the low latitudes over the YHRV.\n",
            " Additionally, the persistent warming in the tropical Indian Ocean was found to be an important external contributor to an EAP/PJ-like teleconnection pattern over East Asia and the intensified and southwardly displaced WPSH. This pattern is conducive to abundant rainfall over YHRV.\n",
            " It should be pointed out that in other abundant meiyu rainfall years, such as 1954, 1991, 1998, and 2016 , the variation of some key atmospheric circulation systems were similar to those of 2020. For example, the circulation in the middle and high latitudes over Eurasia also featured a typical pattern of \"two ridges and one trough \" with frequent cold air activities from high latitudes (Ding, 1993) , the location of the upper westerly jet in East Asia was relatively stable and its second northward shift was not significant (Wang et al., 1992) , and the meridional movement of WPSH was also small (Mao and Wu, 2005) . Moreover, the meiyu periods during these years were always accompanied by strong QBWO (Lu and Ding, 1996; Mao and Wu, 2005) . Thus, combined with the analysis of the meiyu in 2020, atmospheric circulation conditions characterizing the formation of the extreme meiyu are summarized in Fig. 11 .\n",
            " In summary, four main circulation factors appear to affect the meiyu, namely the blocking high in the mid-high latitudes, the WPSH, the southwesterly jet and its associated transport of warm and moist air, and the upper-level East Asian westerly jet. The locations of both the WPSH and the East Asian westerly jet which favor heavy rainfall over the YHRV tend to be stable in the range of 20°-26°N and 37°-40°N, respectively. Meanwhile, the southward invasion of cold air from the high latitudes coincides with the strengthening of the low-level southwesterly jet. This interaction represents yet another major circulation pattern that favors the occurrence of heavy rainfall over the YHRV. Furthermore, multiple and strong QBWOs are conducive to the repeated occurrence of heavy rainfall processes and excessive meiyu rainfall over the YHRV. Moreover, the two rapid northward jumps of the WPSH in summer are closely related to the intraseasonal oscillation (Lu et al., 2005; Su et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2021) . Yang et al. (2010) also argued that the QBWO strengthens the westward and northward extension of the WPSH, resulting in anomalous precipitation during the meiyu season. Therefore, the variability of QBWO and its role in the summer monsoon subsystems and meiyu variation deserve more attention and warrant further investigation.\n",
            " Lastly, such a record-breaking event occurred within a weak ENSO background, and our study suggests that the persistent warming of the tropical Indian Ocean seems to be an important contributor to enhancing the meiyu, which is consistent with the findings of Takaya et al. (2020) . The tem- Fig. 11 . Schematic diagram of atmospheric circulation conditions for the formation of the record breaking meiyu in 2020. DING ET AL. poral and spatial distribution of the SSTA for the 2020 case is different from those in 1998 and 2016 which featured a super El Niño (Huang et al., 1998; Yuan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019) . On the other hand, the entire Indian Ocean has been warming throughout the past half-century (Dong et al., 2014; Swapna et al., 2014; Roxy, 2014) and the impact of the IOBM on the Asian summer climate has been enhanced since the late 1970s, based on both statistical analysis and numerical experiments (Sun et al., 2019a) . The 2020 case suggests that inter-basin SST and multiple timescale variabilities play important roles in affecting the meiyu (Xie et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2021) . Further investigation is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the pan-tropical SSTAs on this record-breaking meiyu flooding event.\n",

            "Title: Changes in General and Virus-Specific Anxiety during the Spread of COVID-19 In Israel: A Seven-Wave Longitudinal Study\n",
            "Body Text: Wuhan, China. 1 The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January and as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 . COVID-19 commonly present as cold symptoms (cough ,fever, malaise, myalgias), gastrointestinal symptoms, and anosmia, but may exacerbated into shortness of breath, severe pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. Men, the elderly and people with pre-existing medical conditions are most vulnerable to severe illness. 2 As of writing these words, during July, 2021, effective vaccines are used to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and Israeli is leading in terms of offering them to the public. Up until the emergence of these vaccines, however, the only preventive treatment was behavioral, and includes hygiene, physical-distancing, masks-wearing, and large-scale societal measures ranging from targeted quarantine to general lockdowns. 3, 4 . Because some variants of COVID-19 appear This is the 1 st report from the COVID-19-Israeli Public Behavior Project (COVID-19-IPBP), a project aimed at documenting the Israeli public's reaction to the pandemic, with a focus on compliance, public trust, resilience, and emotional distress. An integrated conceptual framework guiding this study was utilized, drawing from behavioral medicine, psychology and psychiatry, and public health. In this first report from COVID-19-IPBP, we utilized data from the 1 st wave of the spread (although we have been, and still are, collecting data). Herein we report on the Israeli public's anxiety, a key factor in populations' behavior during medical crises such as mass-vaccination, plagues, and global hostilities 6 .\n",
            " Anxiety is largely considered a negative force, usually a clinical outcome of the crisis 7 . It is construed as an alarming outcome among medical teams 8 , as well as a factor derailing the public's compliance with instructions issued by policy makers 7 . Importantly, some levels of fear which are compatible with the medical threat are expected in the public, and some levels of anxiety can act to positively encourage people to adhere to guidelines. Nevertheless, extreme levels of fear and anxiety, tantamount to \"panic\", are likely to exacerbate the spread of epidemics and pandemics 9 . At the same time, low levels of anxiety may be associated with an underestimation of the medical threat, and often represent \"complacency \" 10,11 . The latter might hinder preparedness 10 , and compliance with governments' instructions, such as those concerning social distancing 11 .\n",
            " Because most pandemic-anxiety research is cross-sectional, not enough is known about trajectories of public anxiety during pandemics. However, one longitudinal study revealed that, in response to the H1N1 pandemic, anxiety increased rapidly, but then rapidly decreased 12 .\n",
            " Moreover, responses to the Ebola epidemic (distinguishable from H1N1 and COVID-19, which are pandemics) appear to reflect immediately high anxiety that was increasing further 13 .\n",
            " We investigated a large cohort of Jewish-Israeli adults over six weeks, using seven weekly assessments. The first assessment (Wave 0) transpired two days prior to the identification of the first COVID-19 carrier in Israel. We assessed general and virus-specific anxiety, demographics, and other variables not pertinent to the present report. Charting changes in general vs. virus-specific anxiety, we compared three hypothetical models:\n",
            " (1) A \"Panic Model\", evincing extreme levels of anxiety, either starting at a low level and increasing very fast or as high anxiety already appearing from the outset.\n",
            " (2) A \"complacency model\", in which general and virus-specific anxiety start and stay relatively low, i.e., not exceeding the mid-level of the scales.\n",
            " (3) A \"threat-sensitivity model\", a title developed specifically for this study. This model reflects a linear increase in anxiety which is commensurate with the increase in the threat (see 9 ).\n",
            " It should be noted that all three possibilitiesand of course additional onesmay occur concurrently at any single population, reflecting a heterogeneous public response to COVID-19. We allowed for this possibility in our analyses (see below).\n",
            " To summarize, the three goals of the present study are:\n",
            " (1) To identify various trajectories of anxiety in the investigated population during the 1 st wave of the spread of COVID-19 in Israel.\n",
            " (2) To characterize individuals belonging to the various trajectories using baseline anxiety and demographic variables.\n",
            " (3) To examine the direction of relationships between general and virus-specific anxiety. We were particularly interested in examining the predictive effect of baseline virus-specific anxiety on trajectories of general anxiety. Such an effect would suggest that at least some of the change in general anxiety during the 1 st wave of the spread is attributable to the spread itself, rather than to preexisting conditions.\n",

            " All analyses were conducted in Mplus v8 respondents for whom any data were available for the analysis (e.g., even if only one week of anxiety data). ML estimation from raw data accommodates data missing at random. The missing data mechanism is that not every panel member responded to every week's survey. The -robust‖ maximum likelihood (MLR) estimates use a sandwich estimator for robust standard errors of parameter estimates and, for the single-class models, yield a scaled test statistic.\n",

Because we anticipated heterogeneous responses to the coronavirus, we estimated latent class growth analyses (LCGAs) and growth mixture models (GMMs) in a structured search, separately for each of the two outcomes.\n",

In Figure   2 we present a flowchart of the various stages employed, linking these stages to Jung and Wickrama 20 . In Web Table 5 we detail our compliance with the GRoLTS-Checklist.\n",
            " Before addressing the Jung and Wickrama's 20 recommendations, we employed a visual inspection of individual trajectory plots. Many plots showed a conspicuous inflection point at the fifth assessment (-Week 4‖) for both outcomes, with individual trajectories tending to show a leveling off after increasing to that point.\n",

As a result, the model-implied value at Week 4 (when both slope loadings equal 0) is the estimate of the intercept factor.

Because we hypothesized trajectories near the floor and/or ceiling of the scale, we decided a priori to allow the variance-covariance (VCV) matrix of the growth factors to differ between classes, as variances would be expected to be lower the nearer the means are to the scale endpoints. This was then followed by estimating models with the VCV matrices constrained to equality, both to improve estimability and to serve as a sensitivity analysis.

We computed odds ratios and confidence intervals for the effect of each predictor in the multiple multinomial regression on likelihood of membership in each class, contrasted pairwise with every other class.

Documenting the unfolding of general anxiety, as well as specific anxiety concerning the virus, was therefore essential.\n",
            " For both general and virus-specific anxiety, our hypothesized three classes emerged: (1) a threat-sensitive class evincing a linear increase till Week 4, then plateauing (29% and 66%, for each outcome, respectively), (2) a complacency model, characterized by low (general and virusspecific) anxiety slightly increasing over the study period (29% and 9%, respectively), and (3) a third, panic class starting very high and increasing in a linear fashion close to the ceiling (12% and 25%, respectively). In addition, for general anxiety, a non-hypothesized, albeit large (30%) and highly intriguing, fourth class emerged, evincing stable, mid-levels of general anxiety throughout the study period. We now discuss the implications of each of these classes in turn.\n",
            " The two extreme classes in each outcomelow and high anxiety --can be said to reflect the hypothesized complacency and panic trajectories. As for the low anxiety class, although it did not pertain to a straight line, the linear increase in this class was so modest (and culminating in a low anxiety level at the last wave) to be deemed as reflecting complacency: Despite the apparent threat, 29% of our sample were unperturbed in terms of general anxiety, and 9% were not worried about the spread of the virus. As shown in previous research 10, 11 , complacency can be identifiable at times of medical crises, and it can be quite harmful.\n",
            " As for the high-anxiety class, it is consistent with a \"panic\" trajectory where levels of anxiety are high already for the start and are even increasing with time 9 . This interpretation, however, should be tempered given the possibility that a subset of the population (12% and 25%, for each outcome, respectively), may constantly suffer from high anxiety regardless of the\n",
            " circumstances. That this class is relatively small may explain previous research reporting the absence of panic at times of disasters and large-scale political crises 30 , in that these studies did not allow for the possibility of various classes of trajectories included in the their sample. In subsequent analyses, we are examining the public and mental health consequences of already belonging to the high-anxiety class.\n",
            " For both outcomes, a large class was consistent with the threat-sensitive model, according to which levels of general and virus-specific anxiety start normatively low, but increase in a linear fashion as the threat grows, and then plateauing. We construe this plateau as reflecting habituation. As described in the landmark paper by Thompson and Spencer 31 , habituation is a form of simple, nonassociative learning in which the magnitude of the response to a specific stimulus decreases with repeated exposure to that stimulus. It has been known for several decades that the magnitude of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation occurring in response to a stressor declines with repeated exposure to that same stressor, and this decline has been referred to as -habituation‖ in the stress neurobiology literature 32 .\n",
            " When general, but not virus-specific, anxiety was considered as the outcome, we also identified a non-hypothesized, large (30%), fourth class, in which mid-levels of general anxiety were evinced from the outset, remaining stable across the six assessments. We title this class Week 0 predictors of the various classes for each outcome were informative.\n",
            " Interestingly, while both general and virus-specific anxiety predictedin expected waysmembership in the general anxiety classes, only virus-specific anxiety predicted membership in the virus-specific anxiety classes. Indeed, in developing the assessment protocol, we were explicitly influenced by literature on perceived stress 15 , whereby virus-specific anxiety is \"a risk factor\" for general anxiety symptoms. Nevertheless, we also allowed for a reverse, or birelational/cross-lagged prospective association, because these prospective associations are often observed in psychopathology 33 . Our actual findings are consistent with the construal of virusspecific anxiety as the stressor, and with general anxiety as the stress-reactive outcome. This pattern is important because it suggests that some of the changes in general anxiety are attributable to anxiety about COVID-19.\n",
            " Second, gender markedly distinguished between participants membership in the classes pertaining to general, but not virus-specific anxiety: Women were decidedly more anxious than men, and their anxiety was more likely to place the in the panic class (and men'sin the complacency class). However, because such associations were found only for general anxiety, it is possible that these gender differences, well documented in previous research, are unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis.\n",
            " Third, older participants were more likely to belong to a general (but not virus-specific)\n",
            " low anxiety (i.e. complacency) class. Overall, the moderating role of age has been documented in previous research , concerning mass disasters 34 . We are not sure why older participants in our sample reported levels of anxiety that were that low, and whether such low-end anxiety does indeed reflect complacency.\n",
            " Implications for public health interventions are noteworthy. That a large subset of this sample was threat-sensitive in terms of both general and virus-specific anxiety suggests that this particular public may be an intense consumer of data regarding the spread, the infected, and the deceased. To the extent that this post-hoc speculation is correct, quantitative information provided by medical leadership, as opposed to dramatic declarations, should be at the forefront of messages to the public. Relatedly, that baseline levels of virus-specific anxiety predictedin the expected direction --subsequent membership in the general anxiety trajectory, highlight the need to assess anxiety that is specific to the unfolding medical crises at the earliest stages of such crises. As for the identification of the \"balanced\", general anxiety class, and the predictive associations involving gender and age, we refrain from pointing out public health implications until we ascertain that this class, and such predictive associations, are specific to the COVID-19\n",

            " One of the reasons why comparison of concentration between 2020 and 2019 alone could be misleading is because interannual meteorological variability plays an important role in determining NO2 concentration, particularly wind speeds as they regulate horizontal advection 1 . A 10% difference in wind speeds around 6.5m/s can cause a difference in NO2 column concentration by 10%, especially in winter season 1 . We chose 80m for the analysis because 80m is a typical height of the \"surface boundary layer\" in the planetary boundary layer. As the temperature profile shows diurnal cycle in a layer below 200m or 300m height, and 80m height is just the central height in the layer, where wind is not so strongly affected by the surface.\n",
            " Mean weekly trend of zonal (u)and meridional wind speed (v) at 80m height, well as the planet boundary layer height (pblh), as it regulates the intra-day vertical diffusion, is shown in Figure S2 . Compared to their values in 2019, during the Phase 1 (starting week 13), u was higher by 92% (mean 3.88 m/s), v was higher by 61% (mean -2.49 m/s). During weeks 17 to 19, u was slower by 70% (mean 1.3m/s). Concurrently, compared to 2019, pblh was about 28% higher in the eight weeks preceding the lockdown and lower by about 13% in the eight weeks beginning with the lockdown. The variation in pblh is more important for surface observation than the satellite retrievals which are column based. \n",
            " Although OMI was designed for daily retrievals, since June 2007 it has suffered a so-called 'rowanomaly' where its radiance measurements in some field of views have been affected by obstruction 2 . As a consequence of \"row anomaly\", OMI is missing data for almost half of its observation range, so the world-wide coverage is currently achieved in about two-days 3 . In this study, we used the product, 'OMNO2d' version 3, from NASA's Giovanni portal wherein the row anomaly flagged pixel and image with more than 30% cloud-fractions have been filtered already. To further analyze the impact of such filtering, we checked the weekly frequency of valid daily retrievals over a sample location, (urban Delhi: 76.875°E, 28.375°N -77.625°E, 28.875°N) for 6 years (2015 to 2020) as shown in Error! Reference source not found. (a). Retrievals were the lowest in January (weeks 1 to 4, median: 3 /week) followed by February (weeks 4 to 8, median: 4/week) and December (weeks 48 to 52, median: 4/week). For all other months the median weekly frequency of daily retrievals was higher than 4. A frequency 5/week was judged to sufficiently represent the weekly concentration. Based on the lockdown phases. we were interested mainly the retrievals made during the first six months of a year. Coincidently, the lockdown was initiated from week 13 to 27, where the median weekly retrieval count is at least 5/week and the inferences made from OMI retrievals in these weeks could be used confidently. However inferences made for preceding weeks, especially those of January (weeks 1 to 4) could have higher uncertainties. The weekly mean NO2 concentrations at urban (Delhi) and rural (Fatehabad) for the weeks 1 to 27 are shown in Figure S4 (a) and (b). The seasonal is visually trend is similar to what has been reported earlier based on ground studies 4 . The relatively large standard deviation in the weeks (weeks 1 to 8) could be due to low number of retrievals in those weeks. \n",
            " It has been pointed out earlier that OMI retrievals are systematically lower than the groundbased Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) column measurements in strongly polluted areas and vice versa in low concentration areas 5 . TROPOMI retrievals have a tendency to slightly overestimate MAX-DOAS columns by 7% over clean regions (below 2 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 ) and underestimate by 36% over polluted regions (between 3 − 14 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 ), wherein low NO2 column values are better reproduced than high NO2 column values 6 . The bias is thus within the mission requirement of 50%. Global comparison between OMI and TROPOMI has revealed that due to the difference in pixel resolution, representativeness remains a major issue: OMI's larger ground pixels, particularly near the swath-edges different amounts of NO2 and of cloud cover 6 . Over polluted areas TROPOMI is lower than OMI's, with differences varying from a few to -40% (in the winter) while in very clean regions TROPOMI has higher values by about 20% 6 . Over India, the difference between OMI and TROPOMI, the bias of TROPOMI is − 0.2 ± 0.8 × 10 15 (1σ) molec/cm 2 , which is − 6% ± 21% in relative value 7 .\n",

The difference between the weekly mean of TROPOMI and OMI columns in 2019 was analyzed. Both the products showed a similar seasonality at urban and rural locations ( Figure  S5 ). Out of the 52 weeks of 2019, over urban (rural) areas 32 (36) weeks had at least 4 daily retrievals devoid of cloud or row-anomaly. Over the urban area, mean weekly difference between TROPOMI and OMI was 0.3 ± 1.3 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (6.4% ± 23.1%) , and was biased high during high pollution (regimes greater than 4.8 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 ), which often occurred during the winter months. Additionally, the difference and its deviation was lower (0.2±0.7 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 ) in the weeks when at least 4 daily valid retrievals existed.

The seasonal trend of the relative difference shows a greater consistency over the urban area compared to the rural area. Over the urban area, the mean relative difference (anomaly) in the pre-lockdown weeks (week 1 to week 12) of TROPOMI and OMI was −0.5 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (6.5%) and 0.1 × 10 15 molec/ cm 2 (13.5%) respectively, while in the lockdown weeks (week 13 to 27) was −2.2 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (-38.1%) and −1.9 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (−34.9%) respectively. Over the rural area, the mean relative difference (anomaly) of TROPOMI and OMI in the pre-lockdown weeks was 0.2 × 10 15 molec/ cm 2 (19.9%) and 0.3 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (22.3%) respectively, while in the lockdown weeks it stood at −0.4 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (-15.9%) and −0.3 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (−11.9%) This shows that although the difference of TROPOMI and OMI with regards to their relative difference or the anomaly was higher during the pre-lockdown months, the difference was lower during the lockdown period. It suggests that despite the underestimation in TROPOMI columns compared to the OMI columns, the calculated anomaly from both the sensors is quite similar and specially in lockdown weeks it is within 5% of each other. \n",

            " The mean top-down NOx emission rate inventory for the BAU is shown in Figure S10 . The total emission rate in the 300×600 km 2 domain was 18.34 kg/sec that corresponds to 1585.16 metric tons/day (by assuming constant diurnal emission rate). In 2020, the 60×60 km 2 region around central Delhi (not including Dadri power-plant) alone accounted for 2.78 kg/sec or 240.19 tons/day NOx emission. The same region in 2019 emitted 3.37 kg/sec or 291.16 tons/day. Spatially local peaks of the emission were found within 3 pixels (10 km) of the emission sources such as power-plants [PM1] . Emission clusters corresponding to strongly emitting power-plants, factories, highways are identifiable during BAU. Especially highways that radiate from Delhi have higher NOx emission due to vehicular traffic as well as industrial clusters along highways.\n",
            " Bottom-up and regional NOx emission inventories are often found to have been overestimated 30 . A reason for a higher emission estimation could be that the above-mentioned bottom-up studies report annual averages that did not consider seasonality of emissions. For example, power-failure leads to a greater use of diesel generators in Delhi during summers, hence higher diesel generator related emissions are during summer than winter. Non-consideration of such seasonal variation in emission may partially explain top-down emission estimation being lower than bottom-up emission inventory. \n",
            " Top-down emissions were calculated via E = S + D = = / + ∇( ). Due to the uncertainties in the datasets used and assumptions, the emission estimates have uncertainties.\n",
            " Tropospheric NO2 retrievals suffer uncertainty in slant column density (due to measurement noise and spectral fitting errors), stratospheric slant column (due to error in separating stratospheric and tropospheric NO2) and tropospheric AMF (due to model parameter errors such as assumed profile shape 14 ) . The trace gas vertical profile is needed to derive VCD by separating AMF from SCD. Column uncertainty due to AMF is about 30% 14 . If the satellite retrieval assumed NO2 height profile has a smaller aerosol fraction close to surface compared to the true profile, then tropospheric AMF will be overestimated and correspondingly the retrieved tropospheric NO2 VCD will be underestimated 14 . Shaiganfar et al., (2011) compared OMI NO2 VCD with MAX-DOAS observations over Delhi and found that OMI retrievals underestimate high concentrations. Over highly polluted regions tropospheric NO2 VCDs are partially underestimated due to shielding of emitted NO2 by aerosols 5 . The random errors are reduced by temporal and spatial averaging, while a major part of systematic errors is expected to cancel out through the difference and ratio in the defined anomaly metric.\n",
            " Estimating D (divergence) and S (sink) is complicated mainly by the variation in wind fields and chemical transformation 9, 15 respectively, in addition to the tropospheric NO2 retrieval. As long as the wind has a constant speed and direction and these parameters are known with a high certainty, the steady-state assumption can be applied.\n",
            " [PM3]However slow winds which change directions with time and space complicate emission estimation as such scenarios have high uncertainty (relative to wind speed) and the sudden change in wind direction breaks the steady-state assumption. However, the error due to non-stationary state is smaller near point sources, which is further diminished by taking a multi-temporal mean. The NCEP modeled winds have an uncertainty of about 20% in speed and 14 o in direction 16 . Based on the sensitivity analysis by Beirle et al. 9 , the speed and direction uncertainty would lead to an uncertainty of 15% and a systematic low bias of 3% respectively in D. Another problem is that while the wind speeds and directions change with altitude, the vertical profile of the trace gas itself is not well-known. For example, the near-surface emissions (from vehicles) and chimney-stack emissions are injected at different altitude and their dispersion is subjected to different wind speeds. The vertical levels chosen for the wind fields result in an uncertainty of 10% in the corresponding D 9 . The total uncertainty due to the wind fields is the quadratic sum of 15% due to wind speed and 10% due to the plume height, amounting to about 20%.\n",
            " Chemical reaction rates may also add uncertainties in the assumed lifetime and the constant Leighton ratio. As stated earlier NO2/NOx ratio is lower when close to the freshly emitting source in space and time, which increases in aged plumes after chemical conversion 17 . Near strong emission sources emitted NO may not be quickly converted to NO2 if the NO mixing ratios locally exceed those of ozone. The NO/NO2 steady state is completely achieved only after ambient air has mixed with the emitted plume 5 . Turbulence in wind speed may enhance mixing and conversion of NO to NO2 near the source or it may disperse NO downwind before it gets converted to NO2 17 . We assumed a constant L (NOx/NO2) of 1.32 neglecting possible changes by day of the week. We assessed the uncertainty in assuming a constant ratio using NO and NO2 vertical column densities modeled from March to May, 2018 over Asia as part of another project, 'Japan's Study for Reference Air Quality Modeling' (J-STREAM) 18 . As shown in Figure S13 , L is lowest (~1.3) over polluted regions like urban areas (Delhi) and over a power-plant (Harduaganj) and is relatively high (~1.4), slightly decreasing between March to May.

            " We assumed that chemical loss of NOx is first-order given by lifetime varying from 7 hours in January to 4 hours in July 19 . Such a variation only partially accounts for the changes in due to seasonality in actinic flux but neglects the changes due to different ozone concentrations on weekends 20 or during the lockdown 21 and dilution by wind. Uncertainty in this assumption was studied using the method of lifetime fit in which the downwind decay of NO2 from strong NOx emission sources was used for estimating the lifetime. This method was applied to randomly chosen date for each month between January to June over power-plants and urban areas. The lifetime so calculated were within 1.5 hours of the assumed the lifetime. The associated uncertainties in were therefore 30%.\n",

            "Body Text: Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease with a variable course, multiple organ dysfunction in severe cases, and mortality risk [1] . In the middle of December, there were 75,704,061 confirmed cases and 1,690,061death globally [2] . A meta-analysis of retrospective studies [3] demonstrated that severe COVID-19 disease course is observed in 12.6% to 23.5% of patients, while in groups with comorbidities, it was up to 44.5%. The mortality range is from 2.0% to 4.4 %, but it can reach 41.7% in patients with diabetes and hypertension.\n",
            " Routine blood tests can help clinicians to assess the severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 [4] . Previous studies on clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 described that disease severity associates with low lymphocyte count on admission, comorbidities, and gender [5, 6, 7] . Moreover, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, Ddimer levels, and leukocyte count were significantly higher in severe than in non-severe cases of COVID-19 [8] . A meta-analysis of 6320 patients from 52 studies [9] has included 36 laboratory parameters showed that the progression to severe phenotype also associates with elevated levels of neutrophils, prolonged prothrombin time, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IL-6, and IL-10 on admission to the hospital. However, most of these studies were conducted in Asian countries. European countries were not presented in this analysis, and we have reacted to the need for locally relevant data on disease course severity.\n",
            " Latvia is one of the Baltic region countries, which reported the lowest total COVID-19 cases and death than in neighboring Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Russia throughout the pandemic period in Spring 2020. In Latvia, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported on 3 March 2020. At that time, the SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in 670 people in Europe [10] . During the first three months of pandemics, 1,066 total cases and 25 deaths were registered in Latvia [10] . This relatively favorable situation in Spring 2020 was a reason for speculations on clinical features of COVID-19 patients in Latvia and their deviance from those of patients in other countries.\n",
            " This study investigated the clinical features of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the largest hospital of Latvia, providing treatment for most patients in the country. It aimed to reveal differences in blood tests in patients with different COVID-19 severity, which was classified by the presence of pneumonia and its combination with respiratory failure.\n",
            " The retrospective study started in July 2020. The Permission of the Central Medical Ethics Committee (protocol No. 01-29.1/2429) and Permission of the Ethics Committee of Rīga Stradiņš University (protocol No. 6-1/07/14) were obtained for this study. All patients were hospitalized in Riga East Clinical University Hospital (the largest hospital in Latvia) from March to June 2020. All patients had positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCT) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids of a nasopharyngeal swab.\n",
            " For laboratory tests, blood samples were received within 24 hours of admission to the hospital. Blood tests included the following groups of parameters:\n",
            " Blood cells: white cells count (WBC), neutrophils (Neu), lymphocytes (Ly), eosinophils (Eo) and monocytes (Mo), erythrocytes (RBC), platelet count (PLT), hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (HCT); Inflammatory indicators: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP); Tissue damage indicators: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin T (TnT);\n",
            " Electrolytes: potassium and sodium concentration;\n",
            " Renal function indicators: creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR);\n",
            " Coagulation tests: D-dimer, prothrombin time, and prothrombin index.\n",
            " For analysis, also data of body's temperature and SpO 2 on admission were used.\n",
            " For detection of the clinical course of COVID-19 medical documents were used. The severity of the clinical course of COVID-19 was assessed by using data about radiologically confirmed pneumonia and the development of respiratory failure. Disease outcome was defined as discharge or death.\n",
            " We have used IBM SPSS 22.0 for computations. For a comparison of three groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. Following multiple pairwise comparisons included the Dunn-Bonferroni significance correction. The Chi-square test was used for the assessment of the distribution of nominal variables (e.g., gender or outcome). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was applied for the assessment of relationships among laboratory indicators.\n",
            " In total, 100 patients were included in the study. Table 1 presents demographics, epidemiological history, comorbidities, and symptoms on admission to the hospital. The mean interval from the onset of symptoms to admission to the hospital for all patients was 7±5 days (0 to 24 days). The most common complaint on admission to the hospital was fever (77%). The mean body temperature on admission was 37.9±0.9 ºC (min -36.2 ºC, max -40.0 ºC), 63% of patients had a temperature above 38.0 ºC. The second symptom was cough (74%), more often dry cough. The third self-reported symptom was fatigue (35%). Onefourth of patients have mentioned varying degrees of shortness of breath. Other symptoms were relatively rare. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite were reported in 6% of patients.\n",
            " The mean time of the hospitalization was 12±8 days (1 to 40 days). Fifty-nine percent of COVID-19 patients developed pneumonia during their illness, and 15% had respiratory failure. Acute liver damage during the COVID-19 was detected in 1% of patients and thromboembolism in 1%. Secondary bacterial infection was reported in 5% of patients.\n",
            " In our study, all patients were categorized into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe cases. Mild cases included patients without X-ray confirmed pneumonia or respiratory failure.

            " Routine blood tests can help clinicians to assess the severity of patients with COVID-19. Our results showed that some blood parameters on admission to the hospital associate with the progression of disease severity. These parameters included eosinophils, inflammatory indicators (ESR and CRP), renal function indicators (creatinine and GFR), and tissue damage markers (LDH and troponin T). The patients with more severe disease course had higher temperature, lower blood oxygen saturation, lower eosinophils count, higher ESR, higher CRP and creatinine levels, lower GFR, and higher levels of LDH and troponin T on admission to the hospital than patients with milder disease course. In general, these results concur with previous studies [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11] . However, some findings should be discussed in greater detail.\n",
            " For the analysis of clinical symptoms on admission, we have selected a study with a similar median interval from the onset of symptoms to admission to the hospital [8] . In our study, the mean interval from the onset of symptoms to admission to the hospital was 7±5 days, which is close to 8 days (with IQR from 6 to 11), reported by Zhang et al. [8] . In our patients, the most common symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea. Their ranking was close to symptoms reported by Zhang et al., but they occurred more rarely. In our sample, gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in 6% of patients vs. 40% in Zhang et al. Probably, a relatively favorable epidemiological situation in Latvia in Spring 2020 resulted in the hospitalization of patients in a better condition compared to Zhang et al. It is also confirmed by data on abnormal chest images, reported in 59% and 99% of patients in our study and study of Zhang et al., respectively. Surprisingly, loss of smell or taste was reported only in 1% percent of patients in our study. It contrasts with an overview reporting these symptoms in 27% to 98 % of patients [12] .\n",
            " One of the important indicators of viral infections in general and COVID-19, in particular, is a change in blood cells count. More often, this is the lymphocytopenia [1, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14] . We have found lymphocytopenia in 54% of patients on admission. It is a relatively low level, comparing with Zhang et al. (75%) [8] , Wang et al. (72%) [14] , and Guang et al. (83%) [7] . Moreover, in our study, lymphocyte count on admission to the hospital demonstrated no statistical differences between patients with different disease severity.\n",
            " We have revealed eosinopenia as a more visible indicator of the severity than the count of lymphocytes. Our findings suggest that patients with severe disease course had a lower count of eosinophils than patients with mild disease course, as also observed in previous studies [1, 4, 7] . Eosinophils are granulocytes, which can destruct viruses by phagocytosis during the non-specific immune response phase, similar to neutrophils. Therefore, the decreasing of eosinophils on admission to the hospital can be explained by more intensive eosinophils destruction than other groups of blood cells or by impaired hemopoiesis of these cells. Simultaneously, eosinophils and lymphocytes correlated positively, and both demonstrated a negative correlation with CRP. It confirmed a tendency of decrease in eosinophils and lymphocytes, associated with the increasing inflammatory process during the COVID-19 course.\n",
            " Our study also demonstrated the relationship between COVID-19 severity and reduced renal function. It contrasts with Feng et al. [1] and Yan X. et al. [11] , who revealed no differences in this function. In our study, the level of creatinine was significantly higher in the group with severe disease course than in groups with mild or moderate disease course. On the one hand, there is a relationship between reduced renal function and older age. On the other hand, the level of GFR (a marker corrected to age) was also significantly lower in groups with moderate or severe disease course than in the group with mild disease course. In our patients, reduced renal function was related to low eosinophil count. It is similar to Wagner et al. findings [15] showed an association between acute kidney injury and low lymphocyte count.\n",

            " CRP and ESP are markers of an inflammatory process in infectious diseases. We have found significant elevation of their levels in severe patients with COVID-19. It confirms the findings of Zhang et al. [8] and Yan X. et al. [11] . Moreover, CRP was positively associated with tissue damage markers -LDH and troponin T. Following Yan L. et al. [13] , the rise in LDH level indicates an increase in the activity and extent of lung injury in critically ill patients with COVID-19. As a marker of cardiac involvement, troponin T level is also elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 [16] . In our study, both tissue damage indicators were higher in patients with severe than moderate or mild disease course. These findings confirm previous results [1, 10, 16, 17] .\n",
            " Unexpectedly, in our study, D-dimer demonstrated no differences between groups contrasting with previous studies [1, 4, 8, 10] . A possible explanation is related to a relatively low count of D-dimer measurements in our patients at the beginning of the pandemic in Spring 2020.\n",
            " The analysis of results showed the relationships between blood oxygen saturation, as a parameter of respiratory failure, and blood tests of inflammatory processes, renal function, and tissue damage in COVID-19 patients. It indicates that CRP, ESR, LDH, troponin T, creatinine, and GFR are indicators for monitoring patients' condition.\n",
            " A relatively low number of patients in Spring 2020 was a positive trend and, simultaneously, a limitation of our study. There was a limited opportunity to predict disease severity or death because some measures were performed on a limited number of patients. Taking into account these shortcomings, we have started a prospective study in September 2020.\n",
            " In conclusions, the most unexpected discrepancy with other studies was observed in the rate of gastrointestinal symptoms and self-reported loss of smell or taste on admission to the hospital. A limited number of patients reported them in our sample. The low eosinophil count was also pronounced in our patients with severe disease course, while other studies revealed a low lymphocyte count under severe COVID-19.\n",
            " The progression to severe COVID-19 was associated positively with ESR, CRP, creatinine level, LDH, troponin T and negatively associated with blood oxygen saturation, eosinophils, and GFR on admission to the hospital. Therefore, patients with severe COVID-19 demonstrated lower renal function and a higher level of inflammation and tissue damage than those with a milder disease course. These indicators can be applied in the clinical assessment and monitoring of patients. Further research in Latvian patients can be useful for the specification of significant trends and correction of clinical guidelines.\n"

            "Title: Assessing the genetic component of the susceptibility of mice to viral infections\n",
            "Body Text: The severity and outcome of viral infections may be influenced by a number of factors. Some of these factors, for example the age of the host, its physiological status or previous infections with similar infectious agents, are environmental by nature. Other factors, by contrast, depend on the genetic constitution of both the host and the infectious agent, and it is for this reason that the encounters between the two organisms have sometimes been compared with the 'battle' of two genomes. 1 Indeed, co-evolution of viruses with their hosts towards less deleterious infections must be advantageous for both organisms, since any viral disease leading ruthlessly and regularly to the death of the host would also lead to the disappearance of the virus. Such situations may have occurred during evolution but, of course, there are no clues to substantiate this assumption.\n",
            " In the human species, several observations of inherited resistance (or susceptibility) to specific pathogens have been reported. Resistance to malarial infection was one of the first examples, while resistance to HIV infection is one of the most recent. In both cases, the observation led to the discovery of a single Mendelian locus: the sickle-cell trait in the first case (HbS), the gene encoding the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the latter. 2, 3 There have also been reports of other cases of resistance or susceptibility to infectious microorganisms that were controlled by single Mendelian units. In most instances, however, the observed differences have a more complex determinism, with several genes or quantitative trait loci being involved, reflecting the complexity of the host/virus interactions. 4 Using the mouse as a model species for investigating the genetic component of susceptibility to viral infections is advantageous because it is possible to test homogeneous populations (inbred strains) using different routes of inoculation and various doses or strains of virus. In addition, once a genetic difference has been observed between any two strains, the genes that are involved in determining this phenotype are amenable to molecular analysis. Finally, another advantage of the mouse species is that any gene that is suspected a priori to play a role in the pathophysiology of cellular infection may be modified by in vitro genetic engineering for further analysis. For all of these reasons, and despite the fact that viruses that are pathogenic to mice are not always pathogenic to man, it has been possible over the past few decades to identify a number of host cellular genes modifying the susceptibility of mammalian cells to particular viruses. [5] [6] [7] These genes, in general, act at one of three discrete steps of viral infection: 1) when the virus binds to the cell surface or when it enters the cell; 2) during the early phases of replication, interfering with the so-called innate mechanisms of immunity; or 3) during the later phases of virus production. This review will consider the cases in which genetic analysis of interstrain differences have allowed the identification of discrete loci with a major influence on susceptibility to experimental viral infections, with emphasis on those cases that have been investigated up to the molecular level by the strategy of forward genetics.\n",
            " Flaviviruses are positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses which are generally transmitted by arthropod bites (mosquitoes or ticks). In most cases, infections caused by these viruses are mild or even unapparent, indicating that some degree of adaptation between the virus and its host has occurred. In some regions, however, mosquito-borne flaviviruses can cause epidemic outbreaks in humans, and infected patients may exhibit a wide range of symptoms, ranging from transient febrile illness to life-threatening haemorrhagic fevers (dengue and yellow fever) or meningo-encephalitis syndromes (Japanese encephalitis and West Nile fever). The reasons why flaviviruses cause severe clinical manifestations only in a small percentage of infected individuals have not yet been elucidated, but recurrent epidemiological observations and recent scientific data indicate that host-dependent genetic factors might be important. Variations in mouse innate flavivirus susceptibility were reported for the first time in the early 1930s. Investigations performed during the following decades indicated that a major locus on chromosome (Chr) 5, designated flavivirus resistance (Flv), was responsible for the observed phenotype with, basically, two alleles: Flv r , which is dominant and induces resistance and Flv s , which is recessive and correlates with susceptibility. For historical details on the discovery and genetics of the Flv locus, refer to Shellam et al. (1998) or Brinton and Perelygin (2003) . 8, 9 Surprisingly, most (not to say all) laboratory-inbred strains of mice are susceptible to experimental infections, while most wild mice are resistant. To mention just one example of this dramatic difference in susceptibility, the author's group reported that a single intraperitoneal inoculation equivalent to 100 LD 50 laboratory inbred strains BALB/c and C57BL/6, was lethal for all of these animals 9.5AE1.5 days after inoculation, while mice from totally unrelated inbred strains recently derived from wild ancestors of either the Mus m. domesticus (WMP/Pas), Mus m. musculus (MAI/Pas, MBT/Pas, PWK/Pas) or Mus spretus (SEG/Pas, STF/Pas) species, or from laboratory strain PL/J, were resistant to the same treatment. 10 During this experiment, infectious particles of WN virus could be detected in the brains of infected mice after five days of infection, and the amounts of virus peaked at 10 9 focus forming units/g of brain tissue by day 7. High levels of anti-WN antibody could also be detected in surviving animals, indicating that the virus replicated in resistant strains. This study was no more than a recapitulation of the many similar experiments that had been carried out over the previous 40 years, with a variety of flaviviruses using several routes of inoculation and several doses and strains of virus. 8, 9 All of these experiments yielded similar results, confirming that the phenotype of resistance/susceptibility is not WNspecific but, on the contrary, extends to other types of flaviviruses as well. It is now established that the phenotype of resistance/susceptibility co-segregates with a point mutation in the gene Oas1b, encoding the 1B isoform of 29-59 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS1B). 10, 11 Although the Oas1b gene exhibits several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the different strains or species of mice, it is remarkable that all susceptible mice tested so far have a T!C transition that replaces an arginine residue with a premature stop codon in the fourth exon of the gene. The perfect correlation between susceptibility to viral infection and the occurrence of a stop codon supports the hypothesis that a truncated, and presumably inactive, form of 29-59 OAS L1 is indeed the cause of the innate susceptibility to flavivirus infection. The presence of a stop codon is also compatible with susceptibility behaving as a recessive trait and fits perfectly with one of the known functions of the interferoninducible enzyme 29-59 OAS, which is to synthesise 29-59 oligoadenylates which in turn activate latent ribonuclease L (RNase L), ultimately resulting in degradation of viral RNA and inhibition of viral replication. 12 In vitro experiments, performed with stable neuroblastoma cell clones overexpressing either the mutant or wildtype OAS1B, indicated that replication of the WN virus is less efficient in cells that produce the normal copy of OAS1B than in those expressing the mutant form of the protein, reinforcing the idea that the OAS1B gene is critical for controlling viral pathogenesis. 13 The structural organisation of the genes encoding 29-59 OASs has been studied in a few species, and in detail in humans and mice. In humans, it is a cluster of three genes designated OAS2, OAS3 and OAS1, respectively ( Figure 1 ). [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Human OAS2 and OAS3 have mouse orthologues in Oas2 and Oas3, and the transcription products of these genes are also very similar, with two alternatively spliced isoforms encoded in mouse Oas2, consistent with the existence of human isoforms p69 and p71 encoded in human OAS2, while -similar to the case in humans -there is only one transcript from mouse Oas3. The function of the proteins encoded in OAS2/Oas2 and OAS3/Oas3 is not yet clearly established. The structural organisation of OAS1 is very different in humans and in the mouse. In humans, there is only one OAS1 gene encoding four different OAS proteins (p42, p44, p46 and p48), resulting from an alternative splicing of the first five exons with the three exons of the C-terminal region ( Figure 2 ). In the mouse there are no less than eight transcription units, orthologous with the human OAS1 gene and arranged in tandem in the following order: Oas1e, Oas1c, Oas1b, Oas1f, Oas1h, Oas1g, Oas1a and Oas1d. For all of these eight genes, a specific interferon inducible promoter regulates transcription. So far only Oas1a has been found to be alternatively spliced yielding two transcripts each including different parts of exon 6. [19] [20] [21] [22] LXXXPA motif is a domain of 9 amino acids at the Cterminus of the protein which is essential for enzymatic activity. CFK motif is essential for tetramerisation of the molecule.\n",
            " Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences for the proteins encoded by the eight Oas1 genes indicates that Oas1c, Oas1d, Oas1e, Oas1f and Oas1h are structurally very similar and lack functional domains, such as the LXXXPA motif, the highly conserved aspartic acid residues in exon 2 and the CFK motif. 23 These observations suggest that, if these isoforms have retained their binding activity to double-stranded RNA, they have lost their Mg 2þ -dependent catalytic activity and, accordingly, may actually be inactive pseudogenes. [23] [24] [25] By contrast, Oas1g and Oas1a encode proteins that could be functional in the 29-59 OAS/ RNaseL cascade.\n",
            " The case of Oas1b is probably the most interesting of all, since, according to Perelygin and colleagues, the flavivirusspecific activity of the Oas1b isoform on viral replication might be correlated with a four-amino acid deletion in the P-loop motif that is unique to this isoform and which does not appear to exist in either rat or human. 11 This four-amino acid deletion may allow the Oas1b protein to recognise and bind a specific conserved RNA structure unique to flavivirus RNAs. Even though this hypothesis is supported by other experiments in vitro, 26 an alternative explanation to Oas1bspecific activity on flavivirus replication may also be found in its promoter sequence, where several binding sites (nuclear factor-k B, gamma-interferon activation site [GAS] and interferon-alpha stimulated response element [ISRE]) exhibit a unique organisation. In particular, it is noteworthy that Oas1b is the only gene for which the two binding sites, nuclear factor-kB and ISRE, are closely associated in tandem, producing a genomic structure that has previously been reported as being capable of triggering gene expression upon viral induction. 27 Sequencing the promoter regions of the Oas1b isoform in remotely related mouse species did not provide evidence that a particular structural change in this promoter might be associated with the phenotype of Figure 1 : Schematic representation of the organisation of the human and murine clusters of genes encoding 29-59 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS). The picture is not drawn to scale but is correctly orientated with respect to the centromeres for each species. All of these genes are transcribed and the direction of transcription is represented by arrows. Most of the mouse genes are probably pseudogenes, encoding proteins whose function is unknown but are probably not involved in the innate defence mechanisms against viral infections. (From Mashimo et al. 10 and reprinted with permission from Elsevier.)\n",
            " NFk kB, GAS and ISRE are acronyms that designate DNA binding sites in the promoter region of the gene. Due to a non-sense mutation in exon 4, the Oas1b/L1 isoform is translated in a truncated form in most mouse laboratory strains, but not in wild mice. Except for Oas1a, the mouse specific isoforms of Oas1 are not alternatively spliced. For isoforms OAS2/Oas2 and OAS3/ Oas3, the splicing process is the same in both species. The human 29-59 OAS transcripts are referenced according to Justesen et al. 17 and Rebouillat et al. 18 (From Mashimo et al. 10 and reprinted with permission from Elsevier.) resistance or susceptibility after flavivirus infection. This substantiates the hypothesis that the stop codon found in the Oas1b coding sequence of most laboratory strains is directly related to this phenotype. 10 Infections agents, especially when they are transmitted by arthropods, are not a threat to laboratory animals Situations in which mammalian genomes harbour orthologous genes in variable copy numbers are not uncommon. Olfactory receptors, for example, are also arranged in clusters and are at least three times more numerous in the mouse than in the man. 28 It was suggested that these variations were the result of different selective environmental pressures experienced by the ancestors of modern rodents and primates. Finally, and again concerning the Oas1b isoform, a likely hypothesis to account for the presence of the same stop codon in virtually all laboratory strains is that all of these strains inherited the same segment of Chr 5 from a common ancestor. Such a situation is not uncommon among mouse laboratory strains and was also observed by Staeheli and colleagues when, as is discussed below, they elucidated the genetic basis of susceptibility to orthomyxovirus infection. 29 Whether this occurred by chance only or under some sort of selective pressure, however, is an open question.\n",
            " Two very interesting observations concerning the genetic control of human susceptibility to flavivirus infections have been published recently. The first, by Bonnevie-Nielsen and colleagues, reports a significant correlation between the basal activity for OAS1 and an A/G SNP at the exon 7 splice-acceptor site (AG or AA) of the OAS1 gene. 30 According to those authors, in a cohort of 83 families, each containing two parents and two children, allele G had a higher frequency in people with high enzyme activity than in those with low enzyme activity, with the activity being related to this polymorphism in a dose-dependent manner across the GG, GA and AA genotypes. Allele G generates the p46 enzyme isoform, whereas allele A ablates the splice site and generates a dual-function antiviral/proapoptotic p48 isoform and a novel p52 isoform. The discovery of this genetic polymorphism and of its influence on host susceptibility to flavivirus infections underlines the likely importance of OAS1 in innate mechanisms of defence. Further experiments with mice should now be designed to confirm this interesting hypothesis.\n",
            " Another epidemiological survey reported by Sakuntabhai and colleagues indicates that polymorphisms at the CD209 gene, which encodes a C-type lectin differentially expressed by CD8alpha splenic dendritic cells and which is an attachment receptor for the dengue virus, probably also plays a crucial role in the severity of dengue pathogenesis. Dermal/interstitial myeloid dendritic cells constitute the first line of the innate host's defence against pathogens at the anatomical sites where it replicates after the initial bite by the infected mosquito. Consistent with this notion, it has recently been demonstrated that a promoter variant of CD209 (DC-SIGN1-336) has a functional role in the transcriptional regulation of CD209 and confers strong protection against dengue fever but not against dengue haemorrhagic fever. 31 Engineering mutations in the orthologous mouse gene should also be interesting to test this hypothesis.\n",
            " The phenotype of innate resistance or susceptibility of mice to flavivirus experimental infections described above was the first example demonstrated to have simple Mendelian inheritance. The phenotype of resistance/susceptibility towards orthomyxoviruses, infections which will now be considered, is the most extensively documented and the first for which the genes responsible have been characterised at the molecular level. 32 When challenged with mouse-adapted strains of influenza virus, for example when injected intracerebrally with the neurotropic avian influenza A strain or injected intranasally with a human pneumotropic strain, most laboratory inbred mouse strains die, while mice of strain A2G and most wild-derived inbred strains resist. [33] [34] [35] This phenotype is controlled by a genetic region on chromosome 16 with two closely linked genes, Mx1 and Mx2. 36 Mx1 has three alleles: Mx1 þ , the wild-type allele, which is dominant and confers resistance; and two recessive alleles (Mx1 À ), both resulting in susceptibility. The mouse Mx1 gene encodes a 72 kDa nuclear protein of the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases, whose transcription is induced by interferon shortly after infection. 29 In Mx1 À /Mx1 À mice, the protein is either absent because several exons of the gene are deleted (strain BALB/c, for example), or non-functional because it carries a nonsense mutation (strain CBA, for example). 37 Here again, the mutant, nonfunctional alleles of Mx1 are overrepresented in laboratory strains but are uncommon in wild mice. It is a good fortune that strain A2G, which was developed from 'illegitimate offspring' of strain A with wild mice, was used in early experiments; otherwise the discovery of the function of MX1, the Mx1 encoded protein, would probably have been delayed. It is also interesting to note that the phenotype of resistance/susceptibility of wild mice towards viruses of the influenza group was discovered in rather artificial conditions, since mice are not natural hosts for that sort of 'airborne' virus. For this reason, it was suggested that the Mx1 system may serve an important purpose against other pathogens of the same orthomyxovirus class or against pathogens of related classes. Moreover, it was demonstrated some years later that influenza-like arboviruses, such as the Thogoto virus, the Dhori virus or the Batken virus -which are common pathogens for wild mice -were also able to trigger the Mx-mediated innate mechanism of defence. [38] [39] [40] Wild mice resist experimental infections with these viruses, whereas laboratory mice do not.\n",
            " The closely linked Mx2 gene, which is only a few kilobases apart from the Mx1 locus, is also non-functional in all laboratory mouse strains examined so far because of an insertional mutation in its coding sequence generating a frame shift and premature termination. 32 As mentioned above, the MX protein product of the Mx1 gene is not normally synthesised in resting cells but is induced after interferon-alpha or -beta (but not -gamma) stimulation in macrophages. Unlike 29-59 OAS, the MX protein is a nuclear protein whose function is to impede virus replication. Several experiments have clearly demonstrated that the lack of MX1 protein in laboratory mice could be restored by transgenesis with a normal copy of the wild-type Mx1 allele or the orthologous copy of another species -rat or man, for example. [41] [42] [43] The Mx2 gene of the feral strains encodes a protein comprising 656 amino acids, which is also expressed following interferon treatment and localises to the cytoplasm. It has been demonstrated that this protein inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus replication.\n",
            " Similar to 29-59 OAS, MX proteins exhibit considerable sequence preservation among most mammalian species, including man. The structure of these proteins has been extensively studied and they have been found to consist essentially of two main domains: an N-terminal domain, which is shared with several other GTP-binding proteins, and a C-terminal domain with two extremely important leucine-zipper motifs, which are essential for proteinprotein binding. 44, 45 Mutations in either of these two domains usually result in loss of activity for the MX protein.\n",
            " Interestingly, it was demonstrated that some amino acid substitutions can only partially affect the activity of the protein, making it unable to prevent the replication of some, but not all, representatives of the orthomyxovirus family. 46, 47 Interspecific variations in the antiviral specificity of the MX protein is It is likely that many genes cooperate to make a mouse resistant to a particular infection, but these genes can be identified only when they have a mutant non-functional allele often explained by some discrete polymorphisms at the sequence level.\n",
            " The MX protein encoded by the MXA orthologous gene of human cells shows a high degree of sequence similarity with MX2; it also accumulates in the cytoplasm of interferon-treated cells, associating with the endoplasmic reticulum. Unlike MX1, however, it inhibits a limited range of RNA viruses. It was demonstrated, for example, that transgenic mice that permanently express the human MXA protein became resistant to infection with Thogoto virus but remained susceptible to Dhori virus. 48 This difference in specificity was precisely attributed to a polymorphism in the coding sequence. These results indicate that the Mx1/Mx2 system is a powerful defence mechanism against tick-borne influenza viruses in mice, although MX1 and human MXA GTPases are also active against some other negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses such as bunyaviruses (Rift Valley virus, La Crosse virus, Crimea Congo virus, etc). 49 In the case of bunyaviruses, confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate that MXA co-localises with the nucleocapsid protein of the viruses in the perinuclear regions of infected cells, preventing the transport of this protein to the Golgi compartment, the site of virus assembly. In the case of Thogoto virus, meanwhile, MXA prevents the incoming viral nucleocapsids from being transported into the nucleus, the site of viral transcription and replication. 49 \n",
            " Coronaviruses represent a large family of positive-sense and single-stranded RNA viruses. These viruses infect mostly epithelial cells of a wide range of vertebrates, including mice, rats, pigs, cattle, birds and humans. (The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in South-East Asia is still fresh in our memories). In humans, enteric infections can also occur in young infants and neurological syndromes have also been reported. Coronaviruses represent a major threat for laboratory animal (mice in particular) breeders, with murine hepatitis virus (MHV) being by far the most frequent pathogen in breeding colonies, although the situation has improved over recent years due to better diagnostic and prophylactic measures.\n",
            " MHV, like other RNA viruses, mutates rapidly and frequently recombines with other coronaviruses of the same group. This results in the generation of a great variety of strains with various degrees of pathogenicity. Among all these strains, the best studied are MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, JHM, A/ 59 and S, of which MHV-3 is regarded as the most aggressive. 50 Some strains have a primary tropism for the upper respiratory tract and others for the enteric mucosa and liver. 51 Mice of all strains and ages are susceptible to experimental infections, but the severity of the clinical symptoms that ensue greatly depends on the genetics of the virus and of the infected strain. Investigations have been undertaken in several laboratories to unravel the genetic determinism of this trait, and two loci have been reported to be of importance: Hv1 (formerly Hv) and Hv2 (now designated Ceacam1). Hv1 has two alleles: Hv1 r , which occurs in strain C3H/An and determines resistance to viruses of the MHV-2 group; and Hv1 s which determines susceptibility and is found in strain PRI. Heterozygotes are susceptible. The cellular basis for this phenotype seems to be at the level of macrophages, in which the virus fails to replicate in resistant mice. The molecular basis of this difference is not known and the locus has not even been positioned on the mouse genetic map. It is known, however, that it is neither linked to the Oas1 locus on chromosome 5 nor to Hv2, the other locus for MHV resistance. 52 Hv2, now designated Ceacam1, is more interesting. It was discovered after challenging mice of various inbred strains with viruses of strains JHM or A59. 53, 54 Strain SJL carries the resistant allele Hv2 r (now known as Ceacam1 b ), while most other inbred strains are homozygous for the susceptible allele (Hv2 s , now Sequence variations in homologous genes of different species parallel the evolution of infectious agents. It is an illustration of the 'battle' of two genomes. Ceacam1 a ). The Hv2 locus maps to Chr 7. 55, 56 After a series of elegant experiments, the molecular basis of the phenotype determining susceptibility has now been totally elucidated. The receptor for MHV, designated CEACAM1, is a glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily and of the carcinoembryonic family of cell adhesion molecules. This molecule is abundant on the intestinal brush border membranes of the colon and small intestine and also on liver cell membranes -two cell types which are the principal targets for MHV replication. 57 This receptor has been isolated by immunoprecipitation and has been extensively studied. 58 It has been demonstrated that it binds specifically to the spikes that are on the envelope (on the corona) of the MHV virus, allowing entry of the virus into the cells. Mice of the inbred SJL strain synthesise an alloform of the glycoprotein (CEACAM1b) which differs from the homologous glycoprotein of the other strains (CEACAM1a) by 27 of the 108 amino acids of the N domain (D1), and this is sufficient to hamper viral integration (and of course replication) into the intestinal and hepatic cells. SJL mice are resistant to 10,0003 the normally lethal dose of MHV-A59. 54 In addition to the murine coronavirus MHV, mouse CEACAM1a protein and its human orthologue are targets of bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis, as well as Moraxella catarrhalis in humans. Human coronaviruses, however, do not bind to this molecule.\n",
            " Mice with a genetically engineered null allele at the Ceacam1 locus (Ceacam1 -=-) have been produced. It has been demonstrated that these mice are fully resistant to MHV-A59 infections by both intranasal and intracerebral routes: 59 after an experimental infection, virus was recovered from the liver and spinal cord tissues of normal C57BL/6 mice but not of mice homozygous for the knockout allele. These results indicate that CEACAM1a is the sole receptor for MHV-A59 in both liver and brain, and rules out the possible existence of another receptor for the virus as previously postulated. 60, 61 This result is also particularly interesting since it is the first time that a genetically engineered mammalian species has been shown to become resistant to a viral infection and exhibit no other deleterious effects. This, of course, might have considerable economic impact if it could be applied to other species.\n",
            " Herpesviruses represent a large and rather heterogeneous family of enveloped DNA viruses which are a leading cause of diseases in humans, second after influenza viruses. Herpesviruses cause either overt diseases, like varicella or chicken pox, or can remain silent for many years, being reactivated only on certain circumstances, for example as shingles. In the mouse, herpesvirus infections are less common than in humans and apparently only two members of this family can infect spontaneously: MCMV-1, also described as murid herpesvirus 1 (MuHV-1), and the murid herpesvirus 3 or MuHV-3, sometimes described as mouse thymic virus. 50 Only MCMV-1 is interesting in the context of this review because very little is known concerning the pathology of MuHV-3, which seems to be rare and is extremely difficult to grow in vitro.\n",
            " Spontaneous infections of mice by MCMV-1 result in subclinical salivary gland infections in which the virus persists for a very long time, possibly for the duration of the animal's life. In this sense, the infection of mice with MCMV-1 mimics human infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), which is sexually transmitted and remains almost unapparent, but which can become a serious health problem in patients who are immunodepressed after organ transplantation or if suffering from AIDS.\n",
            " Experimental infections of mice not previously infected (ie with a specific Because the infectious agents are sometimes very different, laboratory animals are not always good models for investigating the physiopathology of infectious diseases in humans patrogen free [SPF] standard) with MCMV-1 can result in the death of the animal or in major symptomatology, depending on the age of the mouse, the strain to which it belongs, the route of inoculation and the dose and strain of virus inoculated. 62 Variations in susceptibility of the different strains of experimentally infected mice have been reported and a major role was initially attributed to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) H2, with strains with an H2 b or H2 d haplotype at the MHC being ten times less resistant than strains with an H2 k haplotype. 63 Recombinant inbred strains are inbred strains bred from F1 hybrids between two unrelated parental strains. The genome of these strains is homozygous for 50 per cent of each of the parental alleles.\n",
            " Scalzo and colleagues, re-investigating the genetic basis for the control of acute splenic replication after inoculation of MCMV virus into mice of strain C57BL/ 6 (resistant) and BALB/c (susceptible), and using a set of recombinant inbred strains derived from these two parental strains, demonstrated the importance of an autosomal dominant non-H2 gene, Cmv1, with a probable location on Chr 6. 64 The location of the Cmv1 locus on Chr 6 was confirmed and refined by several authors, and it was demonstrated that the phenotype of resistance/ susceptibility was correlated with the activity of natural killer (NK) cells against MCMV-1-infected cells. [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] Positional cloning of the Cmv1 locus revealed that the phenotype was associated with structural variations in a cluster of genes -members of the killer cell lectin-like receptor family a (Klra), encoding inhibitory or activating NK cell receptors that interact with MHC class 1 molecules in promoting cytolysis of infected cells. 70 The observation that the recombinant inbred strain BXD-8/Ty, with a Cmv1 r haplotype derived from strain C57BL/6, was nonetheless highly susceptible to MCMV-1 infection, was explained by the discovery of a deletion of the Klra8 gene, pointing to the specific importance of this gene. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, Brown and colleagues demonstrated that the Ly49H was absent in mice of the BXD-8 strain and, moreover, that treatment with an anti-Ly49H monoclonal antibody prior to MCMV infection abrogated MCMV resistance in mice of the C57BL/6 inbred strain. 71 This suspicion was confirmed by producing 'resistant' transgenic mice expressing a functional KLRA8 (formerly Ly49H) in an otherwise susceptible genetic background. 72 The innate defence mechanism operating against MCMV-1 is now well understood: the resistant allele at the Klra8 locus encodes a membrane receptor capable of binding to a viral product called m157, which is an MHC class I-like protein expressed at the surface of all infected cells, and the m157-KLRA8 interaction triggers the cytolytic machinery of NK cells and the production of interferon-ª. 73, 74 Infected mice are then protected by both the killing of infected cells and the production of interferon. The Klra8 locus provides the first example of an NK receptor that is able to mediate clearance of viral infection via direct recognition of a virally encoded protein. 75 Two interesting observations on this mechanism of defence were published recently. The first, by French and co-workers, indicates that more aggressive mutant viruses can emerge under the selective pressure of innate immunity as it operates in the case of herpesviruses. 76 This, of course, raises a serious issue, since mutant viruses may also occur in human patients and cause death. The second observation originates from Vidal's laboratory at McGill University, from which a great deal of current knowledge about innate immunity to MCMV-1 has been acquired, and indicates that the NK cell mechanism implicated in resistance depends on the functional interaction of the Ly49P receptor with the MHC class I molecule H-2D(k) on MCMV-infected cells. 77 The first observations on the role of H2 genes have thus been confirmed and elegantly interpreted.\n",
            " Retroviruses are special types of RNA virus because, after infection of permissive mammalian cells, they are retrotranscribed as proviruses and integrate into the mammalian genome, where they stay forever. In general, there are three types of retrovirus: the oncoviruses, whose genes are transcribed in oncogenic molecules; the spumaviruses, which are responsible for weak or inapparent infections in many mammalian species; and the lentiviruses, of which HIV1 and HIV2 as the most famous examples, are cytopathogenic. All three classes of retroviruses can infect mice and variations in the susceptibility of the different inbred strains have long been known. 78, 79 The Friend leukaemia virus and its many variants have been used extensively as models for studying the intimate mechanisms at work in the determinism of oncovirus susceptibility. From these studies, a number of cellular genes have been identified, either after pure in vitro approaches or because they existed in different allelic forms in the different laboratory strains. All of these genes (designated Fv1, Fv2, Fv4, Rmcf, etc) actively protect the cells from infection by different mechanisms, acting at different steps of the viral life cycle, and some of them have now been cloned. [80] [81] [82] All of these results have been presented in detail in several excellent reviews, so will not be further discussed here. 7, [83] [84] [85] [86] It is, however, important to understand that research on the susceptibility of mouse cells to adapted retroviruses may have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to inhibit other retroviral infections, including those by the lentiviruses HIV1 and HIV2.\n",
            " Several other cases where different strains of laboratory mice exhibit different degrees of susceptibility when experimentally infected have been studied. So far, however, knowledge of these genes has not reached a level of resolution leading to the molecular characterisation of gene products.\n",
            " Among the most documented cases in which there is a strong influence of host genetics are infections with Theiler's virus. This picornavirus, which is very common in wild mice and is an occasional contaminant of laboratory animal colonies, causes persistent and demyelinating infections of the central nervous system, and this syndrome is considered to be one of the best models of human multiple sclerosis. The virus infects neurones for a few weeks and then shifts to white matter, where it persists in glial cells and macrophages. Susceptibility to persistent infection varies among inbred strains and is multigenic, with a major effect of H2 class I genes. Other non-H2 susceptibility loci have been identified, but so far none have been cloned. 87, 88 Tmevp1 and Tmevp3 are two of these non-H2 genes that appear to regulate the expression of important cytokines. 89 Another example is provided by the Sindbis virus, an alphavirus. Based on the observation that BALB/c mice are resistant while C57BL/6 are susceptible, a gene (neuro-adapted Sindbis virus 1 [Nsv1]) which controls early viral load and determines the likelihood of paralysis and death has been discovered and mapped to Chr 2, but here again the molecular nature of the protein encoded by this gene is not yet known. 90 Finally, a few other genes or genetic regions have been found to be of importance for the genetic control of susceptibility of mice to experimental infections with human herpes simplex virus 1. These genes have not even been precisely mapped. 91 \n",
            " This review has reported a small number of cases in which different strains of laboratory mice exhibit varying behaviour, with some of them being more resistant than others after experimental infection with several types of viruses. Using the classical strategy of forward genetics, often called positional cloning, a handful of loci have been identified at the molecular level and the gene products characterised. This has helped to explain why, for example, if the alloform of the CEACAM1 glycoprotein that appears at the surface of intestinal and liver cells of mice does not 'fit' perfectly with the viral ligand, entry of the coronavirus MHV into the cell is impeded and the mouse is not infected. This discovery had an immediate application, with the production of a resistant (and viable) transgenic mouse strain with no glycoprotein at all on its cell surface. Similar situations with other viruses and other species might be discovered in the future. Unfortunately, situations as simple and straightforward as that reported above will probably not be frequent. Viruses are highly host specific, and information gathered from experiments performed in mice with mouse viruses can only be considered as indications or 'targets' for investigations in other species. Human coronaviruses, for example, do not, apparently, bind to CEACAM1-like molecules. Another difficulty is that viruses often use functionally important molecules as receptors, which cannot be deleted or even altered without important sideeffects for the host cells. Modifying the cell receptor structure with the aim of altering the phenotype of susceptibility of a given species to viral infection will probably not reveal an easy way to go.\n",
            " The case of the OAS1 locus and its importance in the innate mechanism of defence against flavivirus infection is interesting for two reasons. First, the role of 29-59 OAS was discovered from observations made in mice, in which Oas1 exists in two versions: normal, or mutant and non-functional. This finding allowed epidemiologists to focus their attention on this gene, which led to the discovery that the region was critical for the severity of dengue in endemic regions, although a totally different alteration of the molecular structure of the gene was discovered to explain this. 30 It is likely that situations of this kind will also be found for other viruses. In fact, the genes reported here as examples (Flv, Mx1, Mx2, Cmv1, etc) were all discovered because they had a null allele, with dramatic phenotypic effects, segregating the different laboratory strains or wild specimens, but these are exceptions. It is likely that the genes that are involved in the organisation and function of the innate defence mechanisms are extremely numerous, with each of them having an additive effect. Moreover, for the vast majority of these genes, there is, as yet, no mutant, nor even a variant allele amenable to genetic analysis. Many of the transgenic strains that are generated worldwide appear to have an increased susceptibility to the viral infections sometimes occurring in laboratory facilities, irrespective of the nature of the transgene. This clearly indicates a high level of complexity and genetic integration.\n",
            " A final important point must be addressed in this review, concerning the polymorphism segregation among the laboratory mouse populations. Unlike human populations, laboratory mice are rather homogeneous because they are all derived from a limited number of ancestors stemming from different subspecies. 92 With an increasing use of strains recently derived from wild specimens of unrelated origin, it is likely that many more genes influencing susceptibility towards infectious agents will be discovered. Wild mice are constantly attacked by pathogens, including viruses, and, accordingly, they must constantly improve the specificity and efficiency of their innate mechanisms of defence. Furthermore, these mechanisms probably vary according to the geographical origin of the specimens. In the same way, the chemical mutagenesis or systematic genetrapping projects that are now in progress in several laboratories worldwide should also provide researchers with many interesting new mutant alleles. The problem in these cases would be to detect the interesting genotypes after challenging the offspring of mutagenised ancestors with appropriate tests.

            " A plethora of algorithms is available to perform ENM (e.g., MaxEnt, Regression Trees) and methods for the development of accurate models have been described at length (see [19, 20] for comparisons). Ecological interactions are hypothesized to affect species distributions only locally (i.e., the Eltonian noise hypothesis [10] ) and are usually considered irrelevant in traditional coarse-scale ENM applications [10, 21] . However, growing evidence suggests that biotic interactions may have a larger role in shaping broad-scale species distributions, especially under changing conditions (e.g., climate change) [10, [22] [23] [24] . For example, continental-scale distributions of the North American warbler are better explained when coupling biotic interactions (e.g., vegetation requirements) with abiotic factors (climate data) [23] . Biotic interactors can be included in ENM by incorporating interacting species as predictor variables (preprocessing), restricting the distribution of the focal species to regions where interactions may occur (post-processing), and linking demographic population models to the final ENM [10, [25] [26] [27] .\n",
            " The two most common disease distribution modeling methods are black-box and componentbased approaches (Table 1 ; [18] ). Black-box approaches model the overall geographic distribution of a final manifestation of host-parasite interactions (e.g., disease outbreaks), assuming that this outcome summarizes all biotic interactions involved in transmission [28] [29] [30] . This approach provides a pragmatic framework to generalize disease distributions and is useful when transmission dynamics are poorly understood and data are limited, which is frequently the case for EIDs [31] . However, the black-box oversimplification may be perilous as it neglects ecological complexity (e.g., the identity of key host species for transmission). Alternatively, component-based approaches consider the individual ecologies of all species involved in disease transmission (e.g., parasites, hosts) [16, 17, 32] . This approach allows the identification of host species and prioritization of areas for disease surveillance and control. Component-based approaches require in-depth knowledge of the disease system (e.g., the identity and ecologies of relevant species, transmission cycle), which may not be readily Glossary Allee effect: correlation between population size or density and the per capita growth rate (mean individual fitness) of a population. Basic reproductive number (R 0 ): expected number of secondary cases caused by a single infectious individual in a population. Biotic, abiotic, and movement (BAM) framework: simplified representation of a species' geographic distribution determined by the intersection of suitable abiotic conditions (A), biotic interactions (B), and the species' dispersal capacity (M). Bridge host: host population capable of facilitating transmission between two otherwise geographically disconnected maintenance and target populations. Coinfection: simultaneous infection of a host by multiple parasite species.\n",
            " Disease system: set of species, including parasites, susceptible hosts, and vectors, involved in the maintenance, transmission, and expression of a disease. Ecological niche modeling (ENM): computational method used to predict species geographic distributions by combining factors related to a species' environmental requirements with those related to occurrence and dispersal. Ecophylogenetics: field in biology that focuses on the study of ecological patterns in biological communities (e.g., community assembly, species co-occurrence) explained by the evolutionary relationships among coexisting species. Eltonian noise hypothesis: ecological hypothesis stating that local-scale ecological interactions have negligible effects on a species' geographic distribution. Emerging infectious disease (EID): diseases that have increased in incidence or geographic range, found in novel hosts or caused by newly evolved parasites. Exposure: likelihood of contact between a target population and hazards. The degree of exposure will depend on the contact rate, the parasite's transmission mechanism, and the nature of a contact event. available, especially for emerging diseases (e.g., Middle East respiratory syndrome) [18] .\n",
            " Obtaining the necessary information on disease systems can be labor intensive, time consuming, and economically unfeasible [18] . Choosing between these two approaches for disease distribution modeling should be done in accordance with the research question, data availability, and implicit assumptions [18, 22] .\n",
            " Data Quality and Availability A major challenge of the application of ENM to disease systems is the lack of reliable, highquality disease occurrence repositories. This has led to the widespread use of black-box modeling for disease outbreaks [28] [29] [30] and component-based modeling of hosts only [17, 32] . The use of outbreak data to model disease distributions raises methodological issues. Disease data are generally aggregated at coarse politicoadministrative levels (e.g., province, country), losing crucial information on the local natural history of the disease [1, 33] . Additionally, the geographic site of infection and the associated uncertainty are generally not reported and may instead refer to the health-care facility where it is diagnosed [1] , potentially misleading the identification of ecological conditions favoring disease occurrence. This could be further complicated by centralized health-care infrastructures and scarce epidemiological resources, resulting in predictions of the site of diagnosis instead of the site of infection and parasite persistence [34] . Lack of information on the ecology of a disease system may hinder proper identification of the parasite species (or strain in the case of viruses) causing the disease and/or the hosts involved in their transmission. This is particularly true for EIDs [31] , posing a significant challenge to the prediction of geographic distributions in an ENM framework.\n",
            " Host-Parasite Interactions At least two interacting speciesa parasite and a host [35, 36] are present in a disease system. These systems vary in complexity as some parasites can infect multiple hosts, potentially requiring the presence of keystone host species for their transmission (e.g., vectors) and maintenance (e.g., reservoir hosts). Here we define 'parasites' broadly to encompass all organisms capable of causing disease (i.e., pathogens), including microparasites (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa) and macroparasites (e.g., flatworms, nematodes). Similarly, we broadly define 'hosts' to include arthropod vectors and vertebrate reservoir hosts of parasites.\n",
            " Since biotic interactions lie at the core of disease systems, neglecting interacting species and their role in parasite dynamics (maintenance, reproduction, and transmission) may lead to failure to forecast disease distributions ( Figure 1 ). Parasite transmission is strongly influenced by interactions among infected and susceptible hosts, which can be altered by host behavior and demography [6, 37, 38] . For example, parasite transmission was found to be related to spider monkey (Ateles hybridus) grooming activity [39] and to aggregation behavior during hibernation in bat colonies of multiple species [40] .\n",
            " Transmission dynamics can be further altered by the structure of the ecological community [9, [41] [42] [43] [44] . For example, host species living at higher population densities with smaller body sizes and shorter generation spans were more likely to be competent reservoirs for multihost vector-borne diseases [37] . Likewise, host species diversity was found to alter transmission by decreasing host density (i.e., dilution effect) and increasing contact rates between host species (i.e., amplification effect) in a rodent-borne disease [45] . Host immunity and parasite-parasite interactions may also shape disease distributions as they may facilitate or limit transmission [6, 7, 41, 46] . For instance, decreased competence of the bacterium Rickettsia conorii was observed in dogs previously infected by other Rickettsia species [47] . Given the complexity of these interactions, traditional single-species ENM approaches could fail to accurately predict disease distributions and transmission risk, particularly at finer scales. However, traditional approaches may be sufficient for some disease systems, especially if they are simple or well understood (e.g., dengue). Therefore, appropriate selection of the approach will depend on data availability and the question at hand.\n",
            " A common assumption of disease ENM is that predicted host distributions and disease presence are equivalent [17, 32] . This should be considered with caution since susceptible hosts may occur where parasites are absent, and even when infection occurs, disease may be absent [7, 48] . For example, flying foxes (Pteropus medius) are necessary hosts for Nipah virus persistence; however, this virus can be absent in areas where flying fox populations are present [48] . Therefore, host presence should be considered only as 'vessels' available for parasite introduction, establishment, and spread (Box 1). Likewise, parasites are generally assumed to be homogeneously distributed across the host's range (uniform prevalence; Figure 1A ) and fine-scale mechanisms underlying parasite transmission (e.g., host movement, behavior, demographics) are usually not considered.\n",
            " Spillover: process in which a pathogen is transmitted into a novel host species, mainly referring to the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans. Susceptibility: possibility of a given exposure to hazard resulting in harm; also termed vulnerability by some authors.\n",
            " Target population: population that is the focus of a study or public health intervention.\n",
            " Vector: a living organism, typically invertebrate, acting as intermediary in the transmission of a parasite from a source to a target population. Zoonoses: diseases that can be transmitted between humans and animals under natural conditions. Outcomes of host-parasite interactions are highly variable, ranging from no apparent negative effects on the host (e.g., asymptomatic or subclinical infection) to host mortality [49] [50] [51] . A review of mammal-virus associations reported that the vast majority of infected mammal species were asymptomatic (224 of 312 mammal-virus pairs) [52] . Hantavirus infections in Box 1. Guidelines for ENM to Predict Disease Distributions\n",
            " The predictive power and biological realism of ENM forecasts of diseases is likely to improve by the inclusion of biotic interactors [10, 43] . However, reliable parasite, or disease, occurrence records and information on disease natural history may be lacking, posing an exceptional challenge for disease distribution modeling. Knowing the data limitations of a disease system is crucial for predictor variable and evaluation metric selection and the incorporation of biotic interactors [24] . Understanding of the biological meaning, assumptions, and units of outputs is equally important for proper model interpretation. We discuss the most frequently encountered scenarios in disease ENM and how biotic interactors should be included accordingly ( Figure I) .\n",
            " (1) Available occurrence data and known transmission mechanism: When parasite occurrence data are available, these should be preferred over disease outbreak data to minimize spatiotemporal uncertainty. However, if reliable site of infection data are available these should ideally be used. In this case, component-based approaches focused on modeling the geographic potential of the parasite can be implemented. Information on host species (e.g., distribution, abundance) can be incorporated as predictor variables (preprocessing) to complement abiotic variables. However, model outputs should be interpreted with caution as proper definition of units may be difficult [24] .\n",
            " (2) Unavailable occurrence data and known transmission mechanism: Given the reliance of parasites on host species, component-based modeling of hosts could be used to identify suitable areas for parasite persistence. That is, estimated host distributions are used as a proxy for potential parasite distributions. Selection of host species (e.g., identity, number) for modeling will depend on their role in the disease system as well as the nature of the system itself. If parasite persistence depends on interactions between different host species, stacked or joint host distribution models (post-processing) can be used, assuming parasite presence is equal or more likely in areas where all of its hosts are found than where only one host species is found [24] . Likewise, seasonal factors capable of affecting transmission (e.g., rainfall, migration patterns) should be accounted for whenever possible. However, excessive use of abiotic and biotic variables could generate over-fit and complex models, which may be difficult to parameterize and interpret. (3) Unavailable occurrence data and unknown transmission mechanism: This situation warrants black-box modeling [18] . The point-radius method can be used to mitigate geographic uncertainty inherent to human disease data [91] . Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in environmental dimensions, outlying disease cases reported in areas of inconsistent environmental conditions (e.g., imported cases) can be removed. Due to the temporal lag between infection and disease expression, temporal uncertainty of exposure should be considered to ensure that environmental variables match disease reports. North America can result in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is often fatal in humans while having no discernible impact on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), its primary host [46] . Host immunity, genetics, and physiology also play important roles in disease expression, varying among individuals [6, 49, 53] and populations [54] . The generalist amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) can cause disease in some amphibian species but not others; thus, mapping a single host would underestimate the parasite's geographic distribution ( Figure 1B) .\n",
            " Selection of ecologically relevant predictor variables is necessary to generate reliable modeling outputs and should be supported by the biology of the species and the spatiotemporal scale at hand [26, 55] . Variables directly affecting a species' physiology are preferred since their relationships with its geographic distribution are assumed to be stable across spatiotemporal scales [26, 56] . Indirect variables may be employed as proxies for direct variables, although these should be avoided if they are correlated with factors driving the demography, dispersal, or distribution of biotic interactors [26] . For example, in the tropics, altitude could serve as a proxy for temperature and has been used to predict the distribution of mosquito-borne diseases, since vector distribution is restricted by low temperatures. However, elevation can be a confounding factor not related to the species' physiology, as compared with temperature, and in general, should be avoided.\n",
            " In disease systems, the effects (direct/indirect) of abiotic variables depend on the parasite's ecology and relationship with its hosts. Parasite life cycles range from having free-living stages to being completely restricted within a host. Leptospira bacteria (the causative agent of leptospirosis) are capable of persisting in humid soils and waterlogged environments [57] . In this case, environmental variables such as precipitation or the presence of seasonal water bodies are more likely to have direct effects. Conversely, parasites unable to persist outside their hosts, like rabies viruses [58] , are likely to be influenced by environmental variables (e.g., climate) indirectly. Hence, host availability may directly affect the maintenance of host-restricted parasites. The nature of the parasite-host association will determine the ecological relevance of environmental variables and how these should be employed to model parasite distributions.\n",
            " Epidemiological strategies to control diseases focus on regulating parasite transmission from a source population (usually wildlife or domestic hosts) to a target population (usually humans or domestic animals) [38, 59, 60] . Component-based ENM (details in Modeling Disease System section) can be used to identify areas where potential disease sources and target populations overlap, allowing informed interventions [60, 61] . This requires a comprehensive understanding of the natural history of the disease system to properly identify host species acting as sources and spreaders of infection [38] . Misidentification of the host and parasite species involved in epidemics and spillover events, or their functional roles in disease maintenance, may lead to ineffective or counterproductive control measures with potential social and economic costs [6, 38, 61] .\n",
            " In single-host systems (Figure 2A ), disease control strategies should target regions where source populations overlap with the target population ( Figure 2B ; [38, 61] ). This can rapidly become complicated in multihost systems as changes in the host community may impact parasite maintenance or transmission ( Figure 2C ; see [41, 61] ). Further complications arise when hosts act as bridges facilitating parasite transmission between spatially disjoint host populations ( Figure 2C ,D) [38] . For example, wild birds associated with wetlands and aquatic environments, such as shorebirds (Charadriiformes; gulls, terns, and waders) and waterfowl (Anseriformes; ducks, geese, and swans), constitute the host reservoir for avian influenza ( Figure 2C ). Since shorebirds and livestock are spatially disjunct ( Figure 2D) , strategies aimed at this group only would not stop influenza transmission from waterfowl to livestock and consequent human infection, despite them being part of the reservoir.\n",
            " Appropriate selection and inclusion of biotic interactors in parasite ENM requires prior identification of suitable host species ( Figure 3A) ; that is, host species that possess characteristics supporting parasite survival, reproduction, and transmission and are therefore essential for parasite persistence [35, 36, 62, 63] . For a given parasite, different suitable host species must share particular traits enabling its establishment and persistence [9, 35, 63] . Here, we propose an adaptation of the niche concept that considers host traits as microscale abiotic and biotic dimensions of parasite niches, defined here as host-space (H-space in Figure 3B ).\n",
            " Under this proposed approach, associations between parasites and host populations can be summarized by adapting the traditional biotic, abiotic, and movement (BAM) framework\n",
            " Occurrence points (Box 2) to host-space. We refer to this adapted framework as BAM-H ( Figure 3B ). Here, B H represents the set of dynamically linked (biotic) factors favoring persistence in hosts where bidirectional effects with parasite load can be observed (i.e., affected by parasite abundance) [26, 64] , such as immune response (similar to predator-prey interactions) [46, 49, 54] or Transferring the theoretical representation of the BAM framework (left) to an empirical ecological niche modeling (ENM) application using real-world data to reconstruct the geography of dengue virus in Guatemala (right). Here, the biotic component of the parasite, B, is denoted by the fundamental niche of the dengue vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti (red polyhedron) [8] . A (gray points) summarizes global bioclimatic variables [89] condensed in three principal components. Finally, the dispersal potential, M, was restricted to Guatemala as the area of interest (black polyhedron).\n",
            " (B,C) Model predictions of disease distributions are affected by the inclusion of biotic interactions within the ENM framework.\n",
            " coinfection (similar to facilitation/competition) [65] [66] [67] . HIV infection, for example, facilitates the establishment of other parasitic organisms including viruses, bacteria [65] , and protozoa [68] . A H comprises the set of physical and chemical (e.g., body temperature, pH, presence of cell receptors in the membrane) host traits representing suitable conditions for establishment and persistence with generally unidirectional effects on parasite load [6, 26, 36, 41, 64] . For example, rabies virus can survive only in hosts with a specific body temperature range (4-39 C) [58] , resulting in a predominance of mammalian hosts (37 C) but not birds (40 C) . Similarly, SARS coronavirus cannot infect cells lacking angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its entry receptor [69] . Last, M H represents the set of host species populations that have been accessible for the parasite to disperse (i.e., transmit). Transmission between individuals is essential to guarantee parasite maintenance [also expressed as basic reproductive number (R 0 ) > 1] in a host population (i.e., intraspecies transmission) or community (i.e., interspecies transmission). Although dispersal-related parasite traits (e.g., free living vs host restricted) are important determinants of transmissibility, parasite mobility can be further constrained by host demography and ecology [18, 70] ; however, these traits may be less relevant for parasites with environmental reservoirs (e.g., anthrax). For example, parasite persistence may not be possible if the host population size is too small (similar to Allee effects). Social contact, grooming rate, or burrowing behavior limits the transmission of parasites (e.g., fleas in small mammals) [71] . Factors constraining transmission can operate across multiple spatial scales, ranging from limited dispersal between individuals in a population (e.g., decreased host population size for density-dependent transmission) to barriers between host populations (e.g., geographic barriers). Parasites may be absent in suitable hosts due to local parasite extinction, seasonality (e.g., host migration patterns, precipitation patterns needed for parasite transmission), dispersal, or transmission limitations (e.g., geographic barriers, low host density, host immunity) and in the case of economically important hosts (e.g., livestock) due to disease management control (e.g., vaccination, disease control programs). Transient infections could also occur in dead-end hosts (H DE ) ( Figure 3B ,C), unsuitable hosts limiting their persistence (R 0 1; i.e., sink populations). Our approach is complementary to traditional parasite ENM and classic transmission models. By identifying parasite host breadth, BAM-H would allow the proper identification of relevant biotic interactors that inform parasite ENM and should therefore be used jointly (Figure 3 ).\n",
            " Closely related host species tend to share ecological, physiological, and immunological traits, making them more likely to share parasites [36, [74] [75] [76] . The identification of closely related hosts (i.e., sharing similar traits) could help to identify potential reservoirs and predict potential spillover (H P ), analogous to predicting suitable geographic areas (novel hosts) for species invasion (parasite spillover) in invasion ecology. Parasite sharing among closely related host species (phylogenetic clustering) could be interpreted as parasite niche conservatism in host-space [as observed in kissing bug species (Triatoma sp.) in North and Central America] [77] . Potential hosts (H P ) would therefore be more likely to be closely related to known hosts. Conversely, parasite sharing among distantly related host species (phylogenetic overdispersion) implies that parasite sharing among known hosts is driven by factors other than host relatedness, important to consider when determining H P . Such factors may include broad physiological tolerances (large A H ) or increased transmissibility (M H ) between host populations with overlapping geographic ranges ( Figure 3C [36, 75] ). Furthermore, parasites may experience expansions in their occupied host breadth (H O ) following landscape alterations or shifts in their geographic distributions [75, 78] (see Box 3 for applications).\n",
            " Despite widespread recognition of the need for risk assessments to ensure successful disease intervention strategies, definitions of risk remain inconsistent. These definitions seem to confound the different processes contributing to risk, hindering proper quantification and comparisons between assessments [85] . A recently proposed framework aimed to disentangle the underlying mechanisms of risk by decomposing it into three processes: parasite availability (hazard), contact with parasites (exposure), and likelihood of infection (susceptibility) [85] .\n",
            " Our proposed integrative ENM framework combines traditional parasite ENM with the hostspace concept, allowing a more comprehensive estimate of the potential geographic distribution of diseases across scales, and could therefore be implemented to estimate hazard (parasite availability). However, we must note that this is only one component driving disease risk for a target population (Box 3). Several often interacting factors such as behavior [59] , nutrition [86] , immune history [47] , and social status [33, 87, 88] are critical for successful parasite maintenance. When possible, these factors should be considered and incorporated into ENM frameworks to enrich risk assessments. Exposure can be incorporated by overlaying the geographic distribution and densities of the target population (e.g., humans) [14] . Susceptibility factors could be added by including information on socioeconomic (e.g., GDP, age) or cultural (e.g., taboo systems, traditional practices) factors influencing exposure to hazard. An example of susceptibility factors increasing exposure is the traditional funeral practices involving the touching and kissing of dead bodies that contributed to the spread of Ebola in the 2014 West African outbreak [59] .\n",
            " Disease risk mapping still faces considerable challenges. Gathering information of parasite occurrence data, in both animals and humans, can suffer from logistic (e.g., sampling in remote Box 3. Improving Epidemiological Surveillance: Using Ecophylogenetics to Estimate Host Breadth Epidemiological surveillance aims to identify and monitor disease-causative agents and to use this information to inform public health policy. However, how can we possibly achieve these goals when we do not know which areas or host species should be targeted for surveillance? Ecophylogenetics provide a basis to disentangle the relative contributions of host relatedness (phylogeny) and host ecology (e.g., interaction networks, demography) to parasite-sharing patterns among different host populations ( Figure 3C [78] ). Integrating phylogenetics with community ecology could help in understanding patterns of host phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion across spatiotemporal scales. This holds great potential for the development of new tools to predict parasite host breadths (H P and H O in our proposed framework), a key component of understanding disease transmission dynamics at the landscape level [56, 77] . Additionally, ecophylogenetics may provide insights on potential spillover events that could result in disease emergence, a highly relevant topic under global change and increased international movement of species leading to shifts in host communities and translocation of parasites to new areas and hosts [79, 80] . Adoption of the host-space framework under ecophylogenetics could improve epidemiological surveillance, allowing early targeting of potentially suitable hosts (HP) [62, 63] .\n",
            " Current initiatives such as the Global Mammal Database [81] , the Malaria Atlas Project [82] , and COMADRE [83] could lay the groundwork to implement the host-space framework and serve as a platform to integrate data from different sources similar to large-scale biodiversity repositories (e.g., the Global Biodiversity Information Facility [84] ). Coupling ecophylogenetics with ENM could increase our understanding of how external environmental conditions (e.g., climate) and host traits explain disease distributions, although these approaches have rarely been applied until recently [78] . Nevertheless, although the theoretical basis to target potential hosts via ecophylogenetics exists, further work is required to successfully implement this approach.\n",
            " areas, ethical human-subject-research regulations) and ecological (e.g., low prevalence, latency) limitations. Parasite detection may be limited by the choice of clinical screening method. Serology tests report past infection whereas PCR or deep-sequencing methods detect parasites present at the moment of collection. Data on susceptibility factors are limited and their effects are not always understood, hindering proper quantification of susceptibility. We believe that a next frontier in disease risk mapping should focus on overcoming these limitations. Investment in active surveillance efforts in wildlife and human populations, as well as new technologies and tools (Box 3) for parasite detection and identification techniques, may improve our ability to collect more reliable disease occurrence data. Interdisciplinary approaches integrating ecology and social sciences may further our understanding on how biological and socioeconomic factors interact to influence disease risk.\n",
            " ENM is a powerful tool to better understand the distributional ecology of diseases. We described how biotic interactions make disease systems more ecologically complex than the traditional biodiversity studies for which ENM was designed. Limited knowledge on disease natural history (e.g., transmission mechanism, host species involved) may considerably change modeling assumptions, resulting in ecologically unrealistic outputs. Here, we present a new frameworkthe host-space nichethat is complementary to traditional parasite ENM, which should improve the integration of parasite-host interactions. This host-space niche framework will help in identifying relevant biotic interactors and understanding disease distributions across landscapes.\n",
            " Finally, we point out that risk can be defined only when a target population is identified. Risk depends on multiple interacting factors including parasite presence, exposure, and the susceptibility of the target population. We emphasize the need for a clear and uniform definition of risk as well as a unified methodological framework to quantify it. Quantification of disease transmission risk is also important for strategic allocation of resources for public health and the conservation of endangered host populations.\n",
            " The ideas presented here should encourage discussion towards a comprehensive methodological framework to quantify and map disease distributions and risk that are based on ecological and epidemiological theory (see Outstanding Questions). However, challenges remain, particularly ensuring that disease occurrence data reflect the site of infection and the biological realism of model assumptions. Increased epidemiological surveillance and data sharing via online repositories will facilitate the establishment of a renovated field of disease mapping based on ecological theories. We provide guidelines (Box 1) to estimate the geographic distribution of diseases via ENM by accounting for data limitations and different ecological scales. The incorporation of biotic interactors into the models will allow more realistic estimates of disease distributions that could help to guide cost-effective disease control efforts.\n",
            " How can disease occurrence data be improved? Besides spatial and temporal biases, disease occurrence data may also be skewed by uneven sampling of host species (e.g., reservoirs) and reports of the locality of development of symptoms or the locality of the diagnosis, misrepresenting the locality of infection. Active surveillance efforts targeting parasite sampling in host taxa could help to reduce these biases, increase understanding of parasite dispersal, and improve occurrence reporting.\n",
            " Can host traits be used to predict parasite host breadth? We have proposed a niche-conservatism approach to identify potential hosts given their phylogenetic relatedness with known hosts. Host traits essential for parasite establishment can be determined in a more mechanistic manner through experimental testing of parasite physiological niches and may be validated in laboratory essays.\n",
            " How can risk factors be integrated into ENM frameworks to quantify disease transmission risk? Behavioral and clinical surveillance provides insights on factors influencing exposure and susceptibility to infective parasites. However, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary to adequately generate data-driven models useful for policy making. Integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches remains a challenge in ENM disease risk mapping, which usually neglects the human dimension of disease transmission. \n",

These chemicals target specific metabolic pathways in pests to control their population. However, they may interrupt various biomolecules in organisms other than pests to elicit toxic responses. Numerous studies have reported pesticide-induced oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, and organotoxicity on human and model organisms (Mandi et al., 2020; Khatun et al., 2018; Sarkar et al., 2018; Nicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2016; Podder and Roy, 2015; Rajak et al., 2015) .

It blocks electron transfer from the iron-sulfur centers in complex I to ubiquinone, leading to a blockade of oxidative phosphorylation with limited synthesis of ATP (Palmer et al., 1968) . Furthermore, incomplete electron transfer to oxygen can generate reactive oxygen species which in turn can damage mitochondrial membranes and DNA, leading to activation of apoptotic cascades (Li et al., 2003) . Moreover, rotenone inhibits microtubule assembly and cell proliferation on binding with tubulin (Brinkley et al., 1974) .\n",

Multiple studies have depicted the impact of rotenone in the etiology of Parkinson disease. Rotenone induced selective nigrostriatal degeneration in rat brain following the inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has been reported (Sherer et al., 2003; Betarbet et al., 2000) . Akinmoladun et al., 2018 have documented hepatotoxic potential of rotenone describing altered activities of oxidative stress markers and enzymes associated with inflammation. In addition, rotenone promotes oxidative damage and renal tissue injury in rats (Jiang et al., 2017) . Siddiqui et al., 2013 investigated the impact of rotenone on human liver HepG2 cells and confirmed that rotenone fuels apoptotic changes in HepG2 cells by up-regulation of proapoptotic proteins such as p53, Bax, and caspase-3. Rotenone is cytotoxic to human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells as it induces neuronal cell death via phosphorylation of p38 and JNK MAP Kinases (Newhouse et al., 2004) . Vomiting, respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse, and severe metabolic acidosis have also been reported in human following rotenone intoxication (Wood et al., 2005) . Therefore, rotenone can cause unprecedented alterations in various organs.\n",
            " Exposure to rotenone occurs through nasal, oral, and dermal routes. People spraying rotenone at farms, gardens, residences, schools, and offices are regularly exposed to this chemical through inhalation. Unfortunately respiratory protective equipments including surgical masks most frequently worn by farmers may not provide adequate protection from pesticide inhalation (Sapbamrer et al., 2021) . In such cases, lungs and its biomolecules are regularly exposed to rotenone and other pesticides. Till date studies investigating the impacts of inhaled rotenone in lungs and its biomolecular components are lacking.\n",
            " Respiratory cycle of lungs is precisely controlled by pulmonary surfactant. It is a lipoprotein complex secreted by type II alveolar cells. The main function of pulmonary surfactant includes reduction of surface tension at the air/liquid interface within the alveoli. Indeed, they also participate in host defense system. Almost 90% of this multimolecular complex is composed of phospholipids whereas remaining 10% consists of surfactant proteins (SPs) (Fig. 1) . SPs include high molecular weight hydrophilic proteins (SP-A and SP-D) and low molecular weight extremely hydrophobic proteins (SP-B and SP-C).\n",
            " SP-A is the first identified and most abundant surfactant protein in lungs (Weaver and Whitsett, 1991) . It is a large octadecameric protein having a molecular mass of about 650 kDa. Eighteen monomers of SP-A in the form of six trimeric units are organized in a bouquet-like structure. A human SP-A trimer is composed of two SP-A1 and one SP-A2 monomers (Voss et al., 1991) . Each monomer made up of a Calcium dependent C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), a hydrophobic neck region, a collagenous domain, and an amino-terminal cysteine-rich domain. CRD is vital for most of the physiological functions of SP-A. CRD binds with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of microbes and accumulate around them to block infection. SP-A helps surfactant phospholipids to lower surface tension in the alveolus and counteracts the inhibitory effects of plasma proteins released during lung injury on surfactant function (Weaver and Whitsett, 1991) . SP-A is copious in alveoli although a little is found in respiratory pseudostratified epithelium that lines the conducting airways. It is also found in human tracheal submucosal glands. SP-B is a hydrophobic membrane protein having molecular mass of about 8 kDa and composed of 79 amino acids. Majority of amino acids in SP-B include leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine, alanine, and tryptophan. They are positively charged and highly hydrophobic in nature. Two monomers of SP-B constitute homodimers in alveolar membranes and other lipid structures (Weaver and Conkright, 2001) . SP-B has been heralded for proper biophysical function of the lungs. It enhances adsorption potential of phospholipids at the air-water interface and it is involved in the synthesis of tubular myelin (Hawgood, 2004) . Moreover, SP-B protects from Oxygen-induced lung injuries and has anti-inflammatory property (Tokieda et al., 1999) .\n",
            " SP-C is an extremely hydrophobic, 35-amino acid lipopeptide having two palmitates attached at amino acids C5 and C6. The segment between residues 13 and 28 is a hydrophobic α-helix comprising of aliphatic amino acids, especially valine. SP-C is exclusively produced by type II pneumocytes and released into alveolar spaces (Ten Brinke et al., 2002) . The α-helix of SP-C is extremely stable as transmembrane structure. Similar to SP-B, SP-C increases adsorption rate of phospholipids and stabilizes alveolar surfactant film (Qanbar et al., 1996) . It also participates in host defense mechanism. A 12-residue nontransmembrane domain of SP-C interacts with bacterial LPS and promotes microbial recognition by phagocytes (Augusto et al., 2002) .\n",
            " SP-D is a 43 kDa protein belonging to the collectin family. SP-D has sequence homology to SP-A. Mature SP-D is a tetrameric complex composed of four homotrimers. Each homotrimer is made up of three identical subunits. Each SP-D subunit contains an N-terminal domain, a nucleating neck region, a collagenous region, and a C-terminal lectin domain. SP-D is the collagenous family of proteins comprised of CRD. CRD helps SP-D to agglutinate microbes and apoptotic cells, and enhances their removal from the lungs.\n",
            " Therefore surfactant proteins are critical to proper lung function. The present in silico study investigates the binding potential of rotenone for pulmonary surfactant proteins. The study will help to understand the impact of rotenone inhalation on lung physiology (Fig. 2) . In silico study is important to investigate the impacts of various xenobiotics on different biomolecules of the body Tripathi, et al., 2015) and suggests a potential adverse outcome pathway (AOP). The present in silico study suggests an AOP of rotenone inhalation. AOP starts when inhaled single or mixtures of chemical (s) reach the alveolar environment and inhibit the function of the lung surfactant proteins. Inhibition of lung surfactant proteins leads to alveolar collapse at the end of expiration and reduced lung function (Da Silva et al., 2021) . AOP was initially introduced in the context of ecotoxicology (Ankley et al., 2010) nevertheless it is now endorsed by Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). AOP aims to facilitate mechanism-based hazard identification of chemicals and particles relying on non-animal methods.\n",

AutoDock 4.2 employing Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used for the analysis. Further water molecules were removed from crystal structure of surfactant proteins to minimize free energy and facilitate protein-ligand docking. Moreover, polar Hydrogen and Kollman charges were added to analyze binding affinity of rotenone. Grid box was added to each target protein and configured to cover the major binding sites. Finally, molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock Vina (Trott and Olson, 2010) and results were saved in log.txt file. In addition, rotenone_out.pdbqt was also exported and saved for each docking analysis to visualize binding interactions between rotenone and target surfactant protein. Parameters like polar interactions, non-polar interactions, Hydrogen bond length, and interacting amino acids with rotenone were studied using Chimera X and Discovery Studio Visualizer.\n",

For this purpose, three dimensional confirmations of these chemicals were retrieved from the PubChem (compound CID: 3039; CID: 1982 and CID: 3286) and processed for the study. Molecular docking was performed as stated above.\n",

Table 1 represents hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions between SPs and ligand.\n",
            " Molecular docking analyses have shown that rotenone has higher affinity for SPs compared to other pesticides (Table 2; Fig. 8 ). Rotenone showed 2-2.19 fold higher affinity than the dichlorvos, acephate, and ethion for SP-A. Affinity of rotenone for SP-B was 1.94-2.06 fold higher than the other three pesticides. Rotenone had 1.70, 1.81, and 1.87 fold greater affinity for SP-C when compared to dichlorvos, acephate, and ethion respectively. Rotenone showed higher affinity (1.70-1.96 fold) than dichlorvos, acephate, and ethion for SP-D.\n",
            " The present in silico study has revealed potential of rotenone to bind pulmonary surfactant proteins at multiple sites.\n",
            " Rotenone was detected to interact with multiples sites of CRD of monomeric SP-A. Interactions were stabilized by conventional H bonds, C-H bonds, alkyl/pi-alkyl contacts and Van der Waals interaction between the ligand and the several amino acid residues of SP-A. CRD is critical to most SP-A mediated biophysical functions and is needed for maintenance of proper respiratory cycle. In addition, globular domain of CRD interacts with carbohydrate or other ligands of microbial pathogens in lungs and blocks further infection. For instance, CRD of SP-A binds with surface glycoprotein of Pneumocystis carinii, a common cause of life-threatening pneumonia and enhances adherence to alveolar macrophages (McCormack et al., 1997) . It helps in neutralization, agglutination, and clearance of Pneumocystis carinii. SP-A acts as an important modulator of alveolar macrophage function that is required for enhanced capacity of phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Gaynor et al, 1995) . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in developing world. Trimeric units of SP-A effectively neutralize RSV in human bronchial epithelial cells and reduce the level of infection (Watson et al., 2017) . Moreover, SP-A via its Sialic acid residues functions as an opsonin in the phagocytosis of influenza A virus (H1N1 and H3N2) by alveolar macrophages (Benne et al., 1997; Benne et al., 1995) . Aspergillus fumigates is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Studies have clearly indicated that, SP-A interacts with the glycosylated antigens and allergens of Aspergillus fumigates and thereafter lowers risk of allergic reactions like high levels of IgG, IgE, blood eosinophilia, and extensive infiltration of lymphocytes (Madan et al., 2001) . In another study, SP-A null mice was observed to be more susceptible to pulmonary fungal infection with Histoplasma capsulatum than age-matched wild-type control mice (McCormack et al., 2003) . The increased susceptibility was associated with reduced number of CD8 + cells in lungs of SP-A null mice. Carboxyl-terminal domain of SP-A containing C-type lectin CRD has antioxidant property. It directly protects surfactant phospholipids and macrophages from lipid peroxidation and oxidative cellular injury (Bridges et al., 2000) . Thus, binding of rotenone to CRD at multiple sites can disrupt the interaction between SP-A and several microbial pathogens that can further result in exacerbated infection in alveoli P. Rajak et al. Current Research in Toxicology 2 (2021) 411-423 and bronchial epithelial cells. Moreover, formation of rotenone ∼ SP-A complex can impede antioxidant activity of SP-A which could enhance oxidative lung injury in rotenone exposed individuals. Additionally, lung transcriptome analysis of a COVID-19 patient has revealed impaired surfactant production in lungs (Gonzalez-Andrades et al., 2016) . Rotenone interacted with SP-B at N-terminal and C-terminal peptides. Protein-ligand binding was stabilized by conventional H-bonds and Van der Waals interaction. Such protein-ligand interaction may impede proper function of SP-B. SP-B is mainly responsible for reduction of surface tension in alveolar walls by increasing lateral stability of the phospholipid layer and prevention of collapse of pulmonary alveoli (Cochrane and Revak, 1991) . SP-B dysfunction is linked to severe respiratory failure (Thompson, 2001) . It has been seen that, the concentration of SP-B becomes markedly reduced in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Simonato et al., 2011) . SP-B is involved in formation of highly structured lamellar bodies. Lamellar bodies act as the storage site of surfactant phospholipids and proteins, and involve in exocytosis of lung surfactant. Interaction of rotenone with SP-B might hinder the formation lamellar bodies. Reduced level of functional lamellar bodies in type II alveolar cells is associated with fatal respiratory diseases (Cutz et al., 2000) .\n",
            " SP-C is a strong hydrophobic peptide that can form biomolecular complex with inhaled rotenone. In the present study, rotenone was observed to interact with SP-C at multiple sites and the resultant ligand-protein complex was stabilized by conventional H bonds and Van der Waals interactions. SP-C organizes phospholipids during respiratory cycle. It stabilizes the alveolar surface film and minimizes the film collapse. In addition, combined action of SP-B and SP-C regulates permeability and dynamics of phospholipid membranes that may be critical to proper lung physiology (Parra et al., 2011) . Deficiency of alveolar SP-C has been linked to inflammatory lung diseases. Lack of SP-C function contributes to enhanced pSTAT3 signaling in alveolar type 2 cells that may lead to hyperinflammation with severe diffuse alveolar injury and sometimes death (Jin et al., 2018) . Notably, recombinant form of SP-C is used in surfactant replacement therapy to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (Spragg et al., 2003) . Therefore, alteration of SP-C activity upon binding with rotenone may fuel diffuse lung disease with variable prognosis and severity. SP-C has antimicrobial and immuno-protective actions in the alveolar and upper airways. SP-C deficiency has been associated with reduced phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages and enhanced proinflammatory responses in the lungs following Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (Glasser et al., 2008) . In a study, SP-C deficient mice were susceptible to RSV infection (Glasser et al., 2009 ). In such cases, RSV aggravated severe interstitial thickening, air space consolidation, and goblet cell hyperplasia. Viral clearance was also decreased. Hence, interaction of rotenone with SP-C may reduce or destroy its antimicrobial activity rendering lungs vulnerable to viral and bacterial pathogens.\n",
            " In the present study, rotenone established conventional H bonds, C-H bonds, and Van der Waals interactions with multiple sites of SP-D that can interfere with its biological functions. Similar to this study, SP-D was also inhibited by methyl isocyanate, alphanaphthol, butylated hydroxytoluene, and carbaryl Tripathi et al., 2020) . SP-D is associated with innate immunity, regulation of pulmonary surfactants and maintenance of lipid homeostasis. SP-D also escalates allergen removal and modulates allergic inflammation . It down-regulates proinflammatory cytokine release and subsequent lung tissue injury through different signaling pathways such as TLR4 (Arroyo and Kingma, 2021) . SP-D inactivity in severe asthma is involved in disease persistence. SP-D enhances binding and internalization of allergen-containing subpollen particles with primary bronchial epithelial cells and facilitates their clearance (Schleh et al., 2010) . Therefore, lack of functional SP-D may result in allergen-mediated breathing ailments. Importantly, phagocytosis and pulmonary clearance of RSV in airways are enhanced by SP-D as CRD recognizes RSV glycoproteins in a Calcium-dependent fashion (LeVine et al., 2004) . Influenza virus is also targeted and opsonized by SP-D (White et al., 2008) . Interestingly, recombinant fragment of human SP-D has been shown to interact with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2: the causative agent of ongoing pandemic disease coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) . In this study, recombinant fragment of human SP-D inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication more efficiently than antiviral drug, Remdesivir. In another study, SP-D showed a dose-responsive binding to receptor binding domain and acted as entry inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-typed viral particles (Hsieh et al., 2021) . These findings have suggested that, depletion in functional SP-D might result in increased susceptibility to COVID-19. SP-D also inhibits bacterial LPS-triggered inflammatory cell response (Atochina-Vasserman et al., 2010) . Various ligands such as 1,3-β-D-glucan, 1,6-β-D-glucan, galactosaminogalactan galactomannan, glucuronoxylomannan, and mannoprotein 1 of pathogenic fungi are recognized by CRD that aids to fungicidal activity of SP-D (Madan and Kishore, 2020) . It agglutinates Aspergillus fumigatus conidia and escalates uptake of opsonized conidia by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils (Madan et al., 1997) . SP-D also binds with acapsular form of cryptococci leading to their aggregation (van de Wetering et al., 2004) . Notably, growth of Candida albicans and its adherence to the mucosal epithelial cells are directly inhibited by SP-D (Madan and Kishore, 2020) . SP-D also promotes neutrophil mediated clearance of opsonized Candida (Ordonez et al., 2019) . Pneumocystis carinii is a yeast-like fungus that causes severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Studies have indicated that, CRD region of SP-D strongly binds with surface glycoprotein A of Pneumocystis carinii and activates defense mechanism against the pathogen (Vuk-Pavlovic et al., 2001) . Mucormycosis is a deadly fungal infection in lungs, brain, and sinus that causes mortality rate of at least 50% despite of first line of treatment. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) acts as a host receptor for Rhizopus oryzae and facilitates invasion and damage of human endothelial cells by the fungal pathogen (Liu et al., 2010) . Interestingly, SP-D binds with the GRP78 (Thakur et al., 2021) and has potential to disrupt such infection. Rotenone exposure can increase susceptibility to the mucormycosis by lowering the binding affinity of SP-D for GRP78. Hence, interaction of rotenone with CRD of SP-D might result in reduced fungicidal activity. SP-D is able to activate P53 and Fas-mediated apoptotic pathways in cancerous cells to execute its anti-cancer function (Kaur et al., 2018; Mahajan et al., 2013) . Therefore, the results of the current in silico study have demonstrated the potential of rotenone to bind with SP-D. This binding can subvert diverse biological activities of SP-D in human body.\n",
            " The present in silico study has revealed that inhaled rotenone can bind at multiple sites of human lung surfactant proteins. These surfactant proteins are known to control the respiratory cycle of lungs by reducing surface tension at air-water interface. Surfactant proteins like SP-A and SP-D are anti-allergic and provide first line of defense against an array of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. It is worth mentioning that, SP-D acts as an entry inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for ongoing coronavirus pandemic disease. Rotenone upon binding with surfactant proteins could impair biophysical functions of pulmonary surfactant leading to disturbed respiratory cycle and enhanced breathing troubles. In addition, interaction between rotenone and surfactant proteins might dwarf host-defense system in lungs resulting to increased susceptibility towards a range of pathogenic diseases including the coronavirus disease-19. \n",

            "Title: Climate change and viral emergence: evidence from Aedes-borne arboviruses\n",
            "Body Text: Arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes have been expanding their global distribution in recent years, and new viruses , such as chikungunya and Zika, have emerged and spread globally [1] . This expansion is thought to be attributed to a combination of increased urbanization, global travel, and environmental changes associated with increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns [2] . That the latter of these is driving arbovirus expansion is not unexpected: mosquitos are ectotherms that depend upon water sources to complete their life cycles, so temperature, precipitation, and humidity play critical roles in the mosquito-vectored arbovirus transmission cycle [3] [4] [5] . Global surface temperatures have increased by 0.8-1.2 C above pre-industrial levels, and precipitation data show uncharacteristically extreme variations in rainfall [6, 7] . Because of this, the global landscape of mosquito-borne arboviruses is being transformed as suitability for mosquito populations and the viruses they transmit changes. Autochthonous transmission of mosquito-borne arboviruses is occurring more frequently in subtropical and temperate regions, occurring at higher elevations in tropical regions, and becoming increasingly more intense in endemic regions, leading to larger outbreaks [8 ,9,10 ] . In the present work, we investigate recent emergence and expansion of arboviruses transmitted by the anthropophilic mosquito species Aedes aegypti (and in some case the secondary vector Aedes albopictus) as a case study for environmentally driven arboviral expansion. We first describe known relationships among meteorological variables, mosquitoes, and arboviruses. We next describe the ongoing global expansion of dengue as it relates to climate and discuss the novel outbreaks of chikungunya and Zika virus that began in 2013 and 2015, respectively. We discuss recent arbovirus activity in the temperate Argentinian city of Có rdoba, where the emergence of dengue began in 2009 and has been ongoing. Finally, we review recent work aimed at better understanding the impacts of climate and changes thereof on present and future arbovirus activity and highlight gaps in empirical and modeling studies that could help us better understand the future of arbovirus transmission under a changing climate.\n",
            " Dengue (DENV serotypes 1-4), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses are transmitted to people primarily by the female Ae. aegypti mosquito [11] . Ae albopictus has been implicated as a secondary vector in the transmission of all three arboviruses as well [11] . These viruses cause a significant and growing burden of febrile illness in people worldwide. Severe clinical manifestations of dengue fever, although less common, can result in hemorrhage, shock, and death in some cases [12] . CHIKV infections are characterized by fever and severe arthralgias, with increasing evidence of fatal complications [13] . ZIKV was designated by the World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in 2016 after congenital and neurological complications were associated with infections [14] . Co-infections are common, and differential diagnosis is difficult in the absence of molecular diagnostics (e.g., PCR) due to similar clinical presentation [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . No specific therapeutic treatment is available for these arboviruses, and vector control remains the primary public health intervention to prevent and respond to epidemics. A DENV vaccine is available in some countries; however, it is recommended to be used only for seropositive individuals older than nine years [22] .\n",
            " Temperature plays an important role in the transmission of arboviruses, due to nonlinear effects on mosquito physiology, which affect rates of development and mortality in Aedes mosquitos [5, 23, 24] . Temperature also regulates viral incubation in the mosquito vector, with optimal warm temperatures reducing the extrinsic incubation period [25, 26 ] . Understanding the effects of rainfall on arbovirus transmission is more complex and depends on the local social-ecological context. The Ae. aegypti mosquito prefers to breed and lay eggs in containers that hold water, often in and around the home, where female mosquitoes blood feed on people. Increases in rainfall can increase vector populations due to an abundance of rain-filled containers around dwellings [27] . However, drought conditions and water scarcity can also increase vector populations if people begin to store water in containers around the home [28].\n",
            " Numerous studies have looked at the links among temperature, Aedes populations, and arbovirus transmission. Mechanistic models based on mosquito thermal biology suggest that DENV transmission occurs optimally at 28. 1 C in Ae. aegypti, and 26.4 C in Ae. albopictus [29] . Other studies have examined suitability of habitats for Aedes mosquito expansion and potential of regions to support arbovirus transmission under current climate conditions and predicted climate change scenarios [10 ,30,31] . A recent study in Ecuador determined that Ae. aegypti will expand its range into higher elevations of the Andean foothills, estimated to affect 4215 km 2 of new territory and 12 000 people under the most extreme scenario of climate change by 2050 [32 ] . Similar elevational range expansions are to be expected throughout the tropical Andes, increasing the population at risk of arboviral infections. Although arboviral disease burden is expected to worsen globally, some of these models suggest that transmission of arboviruses may decrease in tropical regions due to temperatures that become too warm to sustain mosquito populations [10 ,29] . It is also possible that local mosquito populations may evolve to be better adapted to changing climate conditions.\n",
            " DENV re-emerged in the Americas during the 1980s and 1990s, with all four serotypes (DENV1-4) co-circulating and causing major epidemics in urban areas throughout the region [33] . In the past two decades alone, dengue has expanded its range beyond subtropical and tropical regions of the globe, with autochthonous transmission and outbreaks occurring in parts of the United States, southern Europe, Uruguay, central Argentina, and Australia [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . In the United States, outbreaks have occurred in Hawaii, southern Florida, and along the Mexico-Texas border [34, 35, 38, 41] . In Europe, a large outbreak of dengue was reported in Madeira, Portugal in 2012-2013, with DENV likely originating from Venezuela [37, 42] . Autochthonous transmission has also been reported for the first time in southern France and Croatia [36, 39] . In South America, autochthonous dengue transmission was reported in subtropical regions of Argentina in 1997 and Uruguay in 2016 for the first time since Ae. aegypti was though to to be eliminated in the 1960s [40, 43] . Today, Aedes populations are found throughout Europe, the temperate Southern Cone of South America, and the United States, and the threat of importation of Aedes populations, and potentially the arboviruses transmitted by the mosquito vectors, is rising with increases in global travel and as the climate becomes more suitable for transmission.\n",
            " In endemic populations, dengue outbreaks are increasing in frequency and magnitude. In 2019, much of tropical and subtropical parts of the world experienced increases in dengue transmission that surpassed orders of magnitude. The Americas are currently reporting a resurgence of DENV, with 3 139 335 cases of dengue fever reported by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in 2019 alone, the highest number of cases ever reported in a single year in the Americas [44] . Over two million cases were reported from Brazil alone; however, the highest incidence rates were reported from countries in Central America (Nicaragua, Belize, Honduras) [44] . This resurgence continues in 2020, with PAHO reporting over 1.6 million cases to date (EW 24). Argentina is currently experiencing its largest dengue epidemic on record, with more than 78,000 cases from EW 31 in 2019 to EW 20 in 2020, according to the National Epidemiological Reports of the Ministry of Health; approximately half of the cases are from the central temperate region [67,68].\n",
            " In 2013, CHIKV emerged in the Caribbean and spread rapidly throughout Central and South America [45] . Both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were implicated in the transmission of CHIKV [46] . The expansion of both vectors due to meteorological extremes is also a likely factor in the rapid spread of chikungunya, as a number of outbreaks followed extreme rainfall events [47, 48] . Furthermore, the year 2014 was the first in a sequence of years that are now listed as the warmest years on record [49] . A large outbreak of chikungunya was reported in Italy, with over 300 cases reported, and autochthonous transmission was also reported in France [50, 51] . In the Americas, over 1.1 million cases were reported in 2014 [52] .\n",
            " Beginning in 2015, ZIKV emerged and spread with extreme intensity throughout the Americas. Between 2015-2016 laboratory-confirmed and suspected cases were reported from 87 countries and territories worldwide, with over 750 000 cases reported from the Americas alone [53, 54] . Autochthonous ZIKV transmission was reported in southern Florida, France, and Argentina-regions at the edge of the historical range of arbovirus transmission [53] .\n",
            " A region of notable Ae. aegypti and DENV emergence is the temperate Southern Cone of South America. Early Climate change and arbovirus emergence Robert, Stewart-Ibarra and Estallo 3 cases of dengue fever were reported in Argentina in 1916, and no cases were reported for 80 years [43] . Ae aegypti was eliminated from all of Argentina in 1963 following aggressive vector control campaigns in response to the yellow fever pandemic; however, the vector became reestablished in its historic range and has spread into new southern latitudes. By 1986, the vector was detected in the northeast subtropical region, and in 1997 the first autochthonous cases were confirmed in northwestern Argentina [43] .\n",
            " Ae aegypti was detected in the city of Có rdoba, Argentina, for the first time in 1995. The city has a population of about 1.4 million and is located in the central region of the country (31.4 S, 64.2 W). Có rdoba has a temperate climate with warm rainy summers (November-March), and cool, dry winters (June-September). Of note, the Ministry of Health has not detected vector activity during the winter months, thus suggesting that local arbovirus transmission requires annual importation of the virus, likely from people traveling to endemic regions [55 ] .\n",
            " In 2009, Có rdoba experienced its first dengue epidemic on record, with 130 total cases reported [55 ] . In 2013, 2015, and 2016, Có rdoba experienced epidemics of increasing magnitude, with 822 cases of dengue reported in 2016 (Figure 1 ). The city is currently experiencing the largest dengue outbreak on record, with more than 7,500 cases reported from EW 31 in 2019 to EW 24 in 2020 [68]. In 2014 and 2016 imported cases of CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, were first reported in Có rdoba, although no vector-borne autochthonous transmission has been reported for either virus. Imported DENV cases were noted from the northern provinces of Argentina and neighboring dengue endemic countries (Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay) [55 ] .\n",
            " Following the first outbreak, a robust entomological surveillance study was initiated in 2009, allowing for monitoring of vector dynamics during the first 10 years of arbovirus emergence [56 ] . A recent analysis of Ae. aegypti from this surveillance study, dengue cases and local climate in Có rdoba revealed significant increases in Ae. aegypti population size between 2010 and 2017. Oviposition and larval abundance were significantly positively correlated with mean temperature in the same month. Monthly anomalies in minimum temperature, calculated using a thirty-year base period (1987-2017), indicate that this period of dengue emergence has been characterized by warmer than average temperatures, with 60% of months (65 of 108) warmer than the long term average of a given month (Figure 1b) . Each of the outbreaks has been preceded by extreme meteorological events ( Figure 1 ). Outbreaks in 2015 and 2016 followed extreme precipitation events where monthly precipitation reached a peak of 8.90 and 11.13 mm, respectively, above monthly averages (Figure 1a,c) . Outbreaks in 2013 and 2016 followed closely after periods in which the monthly mean minimum temperature was as much as 3 C higher than monthly averages, and the 2009 and 2015 outbreaks occurred during periods in which the monthly mean temperature was 2-3 C higher than monthly averages (Figure 1b,c) . The current 2020 epidemic is an order of magnitude greater than outbreaks previously experienced. However, it is hypothesized that the epidemic has grown due to the increased time that people are spending in their homes, exposed to Ae. aegypti, due to mandatory quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate and other non-climate co-variates that may have increased the likelihood of the current epidemic also need to be explored.\n",
            " Ongoing research in Có rdoba continues to assess the role of climate in mosquito-borne disease emergence at a local level over a long-term period. Although meteorological anomolies have been associated with each of the dengue outbreaks in the last decade, it is difficult to find significant relationships between climate and dengue transmission in a period of initial emergence with four outbreaks across ten years. It is, however, possible with the available data to begin exploring the effects of climare variability and extreme climate events on arbovirus transmission, and, as we have done here, use the results of this exploration to inform future studies aimed at finding signficant links between climate and arbovirus transmission. Có rdoba is among a short list of places where an actively emerging arbovirus can be carefully studied and may provide important insights to understanding the emergence of arboviruses globally.\n",
            " With concerns of continued global expansion of arboviruses driven by climate change, much effort has been placed on developing a better understanding of which regions of the world are at risk today and in the future. Many mathematical and statistical studies have investigated the potential for dengue and related arboviruses to emerge in naive populations as a result of global rises in surface temperatures [57] . Studies have emphasized the connection between climate and dengue and predicted the potential for expansion of both the vectors and the arboviruses into regions at the margins of transmission that are currently deemed unsuitable for arbovirus transmission [10 ,58,59 ,60] . Region-specific studies have predicted the potential for greater suitability for arbovirus transmission in some major U.S. cities [61 ] , rural and southern regions of Brazil [62] , and central and western regions of China [63] , among others.\n",
            " Although multiple studies have been conducted at the global scale, there are a dearth of local longitudinal studies in zones of current and future arbovirus emergence. The recent work investigating the impacts of climate on dengue in Có rdoba is among the few longitudinal studies that aim to connect dengue emergence with temperature and precipitation in a temperate region. While global analyses are informative, it is local analyses that underscore the evidence that climate and arbovirus transmission are closely linked. Studies aimed at detecting arbovirus emergence and investigating links between transmission and climate are vital to our ability to understand, predict, and respond to emergence events [64, 65] . In a recent study, health sector stakeholders from the Caribbean have highlighted the urgent need for more local studies linking climate and arboviral disease-without this information, they are limited in their ability to take informed actions to adapt to a changing climate [66 ] .\n",
            " Additional empirical, modeling, and statistical studies are imperative for developing a better understanding of the links between climate and arbovirus transmission, particularly in regions at the margin of arbovirus emergence. In addition, resources are needed to strengthen entomological and epidemiological surveillance by the public health sector in regions of emergence, and the establishment of sentinel surveillance sites in zones of likely future emergence. \n",

            "Body Text: 19. The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be related to urbanization, habitat destruction, live animal trade, intensive livestock farming and global travel. The contribution of climate and air pollution requires additional studies. Importantly, the severity of COVID-19 depends on the interactions between the viral infection, ageing and chronic diseases such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and obesity which are themselves influenced by environmental stressors. The mechanisms of these interactions deserve additional scrutiny. Both the pandemic and the social response to the disease have elicited an array of behavioural and societal changes that may remain long after the pandemic and that may have long term health effects including on mental health. Recovery plans are currently being discussed or implemented and the environmental and health impacts of those plans are not clearly foreseen. Clearly, COVID-19 will have a long-lasting impact on the environmental health field and will open new research perspectives and policy needs.\n",
            " The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the world's economic and health systems and exemplifies the degree of global interdependencies and need of preparedness for global health threats. Much of the focus is now on the response to the pandemic and the development of treatments and vaccines. Health threats due to human impacts on Earth may appear to be of less immediate concern: climate change, pollution, urbanisation and unsustainable consumption that have led to major environmental disturbances and biodiversity loss. It may be tempting to develop solutions to the pandemic independently of these threats, such as relying on disposable materials, reducing public transport use, and subsidizing heavily polluting industries. Such responses might yield short-term health and economic benefits but would forfeit needed long-term improvements in human health and sustainability. In fact, neither climate change nor other environmental stressors and their impacts on human and ecosystems health have receded. Furthermore, the COVID-19 crisis highlights the links between environmental changes and emergence of infectious diseases and warns us of the urgent need to prevent such pandemics, as their control has proven to be highly challenging in a globalized world. This calls for a planetary health perspective in governance and research and for inter-, trans-disciplinary and trans-sectorial approaches. This work was conducted by HERA, an EU H2020 programme that includes 24 partner institutes across Europe and hundreds of collaborating researchers and wider community stakeholders (www.HERAresearchEU.eu). The aim of HERA is to set the priorities for an environment, climate and health research agenda in the EU by adopting a holistic and systemic approach in the face of global environmental changes. An interim agenda identifying six major research goals has already been set (https://www.heraresearcheu.eu/hera-2030-agenda). With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, HERA partners constituted a HERA-COVID-19 working group to reflect on the connections between COVID-19 and the Environment, Climate and Health nexus. In the course of this work, we developed a common understanding of the multiple and strong interactions between the pandemic and environmental issues and of the corresponding emerging research needs, while also reflecting on the environmental and health impacts of the response to the pandemic and of the recovery plans.\n",
            " The response to COVID-19 is further complicated by concurrent threats such as heat waves (Pascal M, et al. 2018) , wildfires, locusts in East Africa, drought in several parts of the world, and the severe 2020 cyclone season. Furthermore, the pandemic itself is likely to hamper an optimal response to these threats-stretching under-resourced public health systems, impeding evacuations and other emergency responses, fuelling on-line disinformation campaigns and conspiracy theories (Islam MS, et al. 2020) . The pandemic and environmental health issues are highly interconnected and we argue that only an integrated global approach simultaneously taking into account infectious agents and other environmental threats can lead to sustainable solutions and policies to protect humans and ecosystems, both now and for generations to come (figure). We discuss here the key messages of this work.\n",
            " The emergence of a new pandemic was not unexpected given the increased understanding of how population growth and urbanization, habitat destruction, globalization of trade including live animal trade, and intensive livestock farming increase risk of transmission of zoonotic pathogens (Gibb R, et al. 2020 ; Plowright RK, et al. 2017) . Indeed, such human activities have contributed to the repeated emergence and spread of several zoonotic diseases since 2002 such as SARS (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV, Zika and Ebola, all caused by viruses (OECD, 2020). These human activities, compounded by the increase in international mobility and weakened public health systems, created optimal conditions for the emergence and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Decreased biodiversity, deforestation and ecosystem imbalance increase the likelihood of the emergence of an epidemic, but additional studies are needed to elucidate complexities and enable efficient countermeasures (Morand S, et al. 2017) . Likewise, climate change, which has direct effects on the distribution of pathogens, their animal reservoirs and vectors, is recognized as a key driver of epidemic emergence (Boissier J, et al. 2016 ; Ryan SJ, et al. 2019; Caminade C, et al. 2019 ; Bartlow AW, et al. 2019) . While there is evidence that climate conditions and air pollution may also facilitate viral spread (Woodby B, et al. 2020 ; Karan A, et al. 2020 ; O'Reilly KM, et al. 2020) , additional investigations are needed. Features of the built environment, from crowded housing to inadequate ventilation in commercial spaces and mass transit vehicles, may facilitate virus transmission; research is needed not only to elucidate these effects but to reconcile disease control with broader goals in housing, transport, and other sectors. A better understanding of these aspects is critical to improve both the prospects for prevention and to develop predictive models for public health risk management.\n",
            " Improving knowledge of the ecological and behavioural drivers of coronavirus infection emergence and spread is essential. Although the zoonotic nature of SARS-CoV-2 has been clearly demonstrated (Zhou P, et al. 2020) , there is still a missing link between the viral variants isolated from bat, pangolin and human (Wang H, et al. 2020 ) and the intermediary host(s) from which the virus passed to human. Understanding the ecology and epidemiology of COVID-19 also requires determining the genetic bases of the susceptibility of hosts, whether they are reservoir animal species or human populations.\n",
            " Examples of key research questions include the impact of ecosystem changes, such as deforestation, land use, road-building, and urban expansion, on human-wildlife interactions and subsequent risk of zoonotic disease spill over. Thus, there is an important need to determine how much habitat destruction on the one hand and human activities/behaviours (farming practices, hunting, markets,…) on the other hand, which both favour contacts between wild and domestic fauna and humans, have contributed to the recent emergences of zoonotic diseases (in particular SARS-CoV-2).\n",
            " Similarly, in a context of climate change, there is a need to better characterize the role of biodiversity loss in disease emergence (Morand S, et al. 2018 ).\n",
            " Method development is also important. For example, ecological health observatories are needed to understand the social-ecology of SARS-CoV-2 and characterize the temporal and spatial patterns of its occurrence in diverse ecological compartments (wild and domestic fauna, water and air), both in cities and rural areas. Screening wild fauna for viral genomes (metagenomics), and implementing open-access databases is necessary to trace the thread of transmission and viral evolution within the intermediary hosts of SARS-CoV-2. This information will also be needed for future emerging viruses.\n",
            " Modelling the spread and course of the pandemic proved to be critical for decision making throughout the course of the pandemic. It is therefore important to improve data integration and processing and to increase modelling capacities across Europe and the world. This could include models that better describe infection spread accounting for both the climatic conditions and their effect on transmissibility (Sarigiannis D, 2020) , as well as efforts that describe the interactions among community members to help estimate the effective contact rate. Thus, models should incorporate epidemiological and demographic data, as well as ecological, evolutionary, climatic, social and cultural data, which are also key factors influencing disease evolution.\n",
            " Research will require close collaboration across different disciplines including microbiology, medicine and epidemiology, ecology, environmental sciences and engineering, evolutionary sciences, agricultural sciences, veterinary sciences, and social sciences, as well as urban planning and mobility studies, anthropology and behavioural economics. Such data are needed both to implement and to validate models of emergence and transmission. For that, integrative approaches should be promoted on multiple systems, including knowledge of human activities/practices, and health status.\n",
            " The combined effects of infectious and environmental stressors are a major concern.\n",
            " The severity of COVID-19 is strongly associated with age and co-morbidities such as lung, heart, metabolic diseases and obesity (Guan W-J, et al. 2020) , which are partly caused by exposure to environmental stressors such as poor urban design, an unhealthy food environment, air pollution and chemical toxicants (Landrigan PJ, et al. 2018) . Better characterization of the immune and cardiometabolic effects of pollutants is essential to identify susceptibilities or exacerbating factors on a population level. The impact of COVID-19 is disproportionate in low-income and minority groups reflecting the role of socio-economic factors in exposure and vulnerability to the virus. The co-ordination of existing cohort studies across Europe presents a significant first step, as will the Europewide identification, development and exploitation of appropriate tools and models to better understand, assess and predict the health, social and environmental determinants and impacts of COVID-19.\n",
            " The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically shown that infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases are highly interconnected, the latter strongly contributing to the severity of the former. It is therefore important to study the interaction between viral infections and environmental factors of chronic diseases such as chemical toxicants, air pollution, climate change and socio-economic determinants. For instance, the dual role of indoor air quality in both environmental contamination and viral spread requires more research focus, as well as innovative solutions for mitigation, including development of air purification technologies (Domínguez-Amarillo S, et al. 2020).\n",
            " Moreover, inhalation of wood smoke at a relatively low level was associated with suppressed respiratory immunity, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections as well as to several types of lung disease (Sarigiannis DA, et al. 2015) ; this is of particular importance in relation to the energy poverty associated with the recent financial crisis.\n",
            " Similarly, the balance of risks and benefits associated with time spent in parks and green and blue spaces needs to be elucidated. Along these lines, health, environmental and socio-economic impact assessment tools should be further developed and harmonized.\n",
            " and analytical facilities as well as harmonization of impact prediction capacities is also an important objective for the EU.\n",
            " COVID-19 has influenced behaviour, working conditions and business in many parts of the world, including increased digitalisation and decreased physical interactions and mobility, and will have long lasting effects on the built environment and the way cities are organized. In addition to the disease itself, the recovery plans may have their own influence on the environment and on future population physical and mental health.\n",
            " Furthermore, both the pandemic and the related control measures have highlighted profound inequalities in most societies that may further increase with the economic crisis. While the pandemic has been a tragedy, many of the responses offer lessons for environmental health, and researchable questions. These are discussed below, and some are exemplified in more detail in the Table. A major challenge in responding to COVID is balancing reduced economic activity to control disease spread, and restored economic activity to avoid the harsh social and health consequences of the shutdown. An equally critical challenge is balancing a return to a pre-COVID \"normal\" condition versus resetting our economy to a new and better one, that avoids the health risks, inequities, and environmental depredations of recent decades (IEA report, 2020) . While this is a devastating moment, it is also an opportunity for transformative change that advances planetary health (WHO, 2020; Belesova K, et al. 2020a ).\n",
            " There are multiple behavioural, economic and societal impacts of the pandemic that need to be deciphered. These impacts could be due to the pandemic itself, due to the initial strategies to limit its spread and/or the longer term recovery plans. Research is needed to better characterize the impacts on urban/rural life, transport, work conditions and inequalities and to better explore the causal relationships leading to those impacts. Research can also inform what the optimal recovery pathway should look like and how it can most effectively promote health.\n",
            " Concerning the health crisis management per se, this pandemic has highlighted the difficulties of taking into account environmental health perspectives in policies and control measures which have mostly focused on curbing the infectious outbreak. In different settings, outdoor recreation, exercise, cycling and enjoyment of natural spaces have been either encouraged or hampered. Moreover, the pandemic seems to have fuelled excess use of plastics and disposables, thus failing the sustainability targets in this area. Exploring benefits and risks as well as potential consequences of the decisions taken to control the spread of an infectious agent is needed to better integrate and promote environmental health issues into the health crises management of an infectious outbreak.\n",
            " Such progress must be informed by rigorous evidence. The needed research must evaluate the environmental, health, economic, and social impacts of many aspects of the COVID response, from local to national and to international levels, as shown in the Table, and it must project future impacts through scenario-building, modelling and forecasting. International efforts could focus on how to achieve efficient alert systems, including their organisation, coordination and communication from an environmental health perspective. Research must involve citizens and stakeholders, particularly the voices of the disenfranchised, to ensure fair and practical solutions. It will require deeply interdisciplinary collaboration of earth and planetary sciences, ecology, biomedical science, and economics and social sciences.\n",
            " Most of the research proposals made in this review require transdisciplinary approaches and are embedded in a planetary health perspective. In order to strengthen both aspects, continuous endeavours at various scales are needed, ranging from institutional research funding, organisation of research and education in universities and academic settings to dedicated and generic research calls and programmes as well as international collaboration. Most importantly, education at all levels, including life-long learning, is critical to foster development of problem-solving skills and multi-, inter-and transdisciplinary research that is required to tackle complex interlinked global challenges.\n",
            " While additional knowledge is required in many cases, there are several instances where it is the implementation of acquired knowledge that is at stake and that needs to be improved. Efforts to facilitate translation of scientific findings into society to support evidence-based policymaking are also required and can be promoted via knowledge brokers and new ways of working, including platforms for collaboration and communication between researchers, policymakers, experts and citizens.\n",
            " What started as a health crisis has become a social, economic, environmental and political challenge. It is imperative that recovery plans and taxpayers' funds go beyond the current economic and social crisis, support and reinforce the EU's ambitious Green Deal and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to benefit health and efficiently prevent future crises (WHO, 2020; Haines A, et al. 2020) . The pandemic has revealed the need to consider environmental health systematically, also in the face of an acute, infectious pandemic. It is unveiling knowledge gaps in several fields and research orientations that go beyond COVID-19: 1) the ecological origin of diseases; 2) the interaction between environmental health stressors and infectious diseases; 3) an integrated assessment of societal impacts of the disease, the global response and the recovery plans. There is a need to identify and implement policies that will bring shortterm and long-term benefits to health and sustainability. What we are learning on the research needs concerning this pandemic may also be true for other environmental changes such as climate change and biodiversity, and their impact on human health (Belesova K, et al. 2020b) . Previous warnings about a pandemic went largely unheeded for many reasons including the immediate costs of preventive measures. In hindsight, it is easy to see that prevention appears to be extremely cost-efficient (World Bank, 2012) . What elements of the health system need to be strengthened in preparation for the next pandemic or other disaster? COVID tested capabilities in health crisis management What are the lessons for organisation, communication, health democracy, and international collaboration? How best to integrate environmental health into the management of acute health challenges?

            "Body Text: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease manifesting with pathological changes in the cardiovascular system caused by the interaction of environmental and genetic factors [1] . The environmentally-induced phenotype is dependent on epigenetic regulation [2] , and recent studies have shown that epigenetics plays an important role in the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis [3] . Further explorations into the effects of epigenetic modifications on the formation and development of atherosclerosis are expected to further elucidate the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [4] [5] [6] . The reversibility of epigenetic modifications may open up new strategies and targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis [7] .\n",
            " Epigenetic modifications include all types of genetic changes that modulate gene expression without involving potential changes in DNA sequence [8] . It also refers to the process by which cells can retain information about prior states and memories of disturbances without changing the DNA sequence [9] by remodeling chromatin structure to alter gene expression, through other epigenetic modifications, transcription factors, and translation mechanisms [10] . Epigenetic plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation during development, stress and disease [11] . Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation [4] , histone modification [12] , chromatin remodeling [13] , noncoding RNA modification [14] , histone modification (including acetylation) [15] , methylation [16] , phosphorylation [17] , ubiquitination [18] , and glycosylation [19] . These modifications regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure and creating binding sites for chromatin-related proteins. Many studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is related to dynamic epigenetic modification [20] , but reserving atherosclerosis by influencing epigenetic modification is an urgent problem to be solved in clinical research [21] . It is necessary to provide relevant researchers with the research progress, research trends, and research hotspots in this field.\n",

This technology allows people to obtain information about scientific output of individuals, institutions, and countries by using relevant parameters, including quantity, journal impact factor (IF) and citation frequency of published papers, which contribute to predicting the development of certain research fields [23] . This kind of analysis is usually used to evaluate a large number of scientific papers in a specific research field [24] . Bibliometric analysis was applied to cancer, exosome [25] , coronavirus, cardiovascular disease [26] and other fields. It is recognized as a systematic analytical technology that plays a guiding role in the formulation of policies and the establishment of clinical guidelines [27] .\n",
            " In this manuscript, bibliometric tools were used to analyze publications related to atherosclerosis in the epigenetic field retrieved from the Web of Science (WOS) databases. Previous studies have often been presented in the form of still images, and interactive images are used in our paper to show the correlation between research contents in the field of atherosclerosis in the field of epigenetic modification. The innovation of this paper lies in the visual analysis of the research hotspots and trends related to atherosclerosis in apparent modification as well as previous research emphases, which has guiding significance for researchers involved in related fields. Over time, the research focus of atherosclerosis epigenetic modification has shifted from DNA methylation to lncRNA.\n",
            " Based on the publications in the WOS database (http://www.webofknowledge.com/, accessed on 3 July 2020), we conducted a bibliometric analysis of the research results from the earliest mention in 1978 to 2020 by online bibliographic retrieval as of 31 December 2020 [28] .\n",
            " All published information on the WOS was collected, and the database was validated as of 31 December 2020. In our study, the research terms were as follows: TS = atherosclerosis * AND epigenetic. In order to ensure that the publications we retrieved were comprehensive and accurate, we searched the following keywords separately: TS = atherosclerosis * AND DNA methylation, TS = atherosclerosis * AND histone modification, TS = atherosclerosis * AND chromatin remodeling, TS = atherosclerosis * AND non-coding RNA, and TS = atherosclerosis * AND histone modification. We also carried out a more detailed keyword search: TS = atherosclerosis* AND Histone Acetylation, TS = atherosclerosis* AND histone phosphorylation, TS = atherosclerosis* AND histone glycosylation, TS = atherosclerosis* AND ubiquitination of histone, and TS = atherosclerosis* AND histone methylation. Document type = (articles and reviews), year of publication = (all years), and language = English.\n",
            " All the retrieved publications were filtered to remove duplicate publications. Data entries and collections were verified by two authors (Linying Jia and Ao Cheng).\n",
            " The total records of papers from the WOS database, including publication year, title, authors' names, affiliations, nationalities, abstracts and key words, journal names, etc., were saved in Txt format and opened by Excel 2019. Our collaborators, Linying Jia and Ao Cheng, browsed and extracted the data from these publications. Any disagreement was resolved through a meeting to reach a final consensus. Lastly, the extracted data were analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2019 and VOSviewer.\n",
            " From the downloaded data, Microsoft Excel 2019 (Microsoft, Albuquerque, NM, USA) extracted the number of papers published by each country, the percentage of the total number of publications, the citation frequency of publications in this field for each country, and the average citation frequency. In addition, the contribution of each institution and the major journals in the field were extracted and depicted as a histogram from the downloaded data. Scientific networks also allow analysis of many publishing characteristics, including country and region, institution, publication time, author, and cited frequency.\n",
            " VOSviewer is a visual bibliometric network-building software developed by the Center for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) of Leiden University in The Netherlands (https://www.vosviewer.com/ accessed on 3 July 2020). This software can extract the author, institution, abstract, country, and other related information from literature search data. These can then be used for visual analysis; mapping of scientific knowledge; and illustration of the structure, evolution, and cooperation within a specific area of knowledge [29] . The processing flow of VOSviewer is similar to other software for graphing scientific research trends: file import author, keyword, and other information extraction; building a co-occurrence matrix; using similarity calculations to standardize the relationships; and statistical analysis for accurate visual display. For the keyword map, a full counting method was used, meaning that each co-occurrence link carried the same weight. VOSviewer software extracts and analyzes the semantic content of titles, abstracts, and keywords of publications, correlating recurring keyword data and producing a visual result.\n",
            " According to survey statistics, a total of 1848 publications were collected from 1978 to 2020. In terms of number of publications per year, 2020 had the highest at 279 (15.06%), indicating that atherosclerosis is a rapidly developing research area in the epigenetics field ( Figure 1a ). Among the countries publishing in this area, China published the most relevant publications or reviews (522, 28.23%), followed by the United States (485, 26.23%), Germany (119, 6.44%), Italy (77, 4.16%), and England (69, 3.73%) (Figure 1b,c) .\n",
            " United States publications were cited the most (24,795 times) with China ranking second (8151 times), followed by Germany (4366 times), England (3143 times), and Italy \n",
            " The h-index is an indicator of the scientific impact of an academic publishing career [28] . A country's publications are ordered according to the number of times each was cited, from highest to lowest, and the list is scanned until the number of the last publication greater than or equal to the citation number is found [29] . Thus, the H-index is the number of papers published that were cited at least H times [30] . The H-index from United States authors was the highest at 101, followed by China (45), Germany (34) , The Netherlands (27) , and England (26) (Figure 2c ).\n",
            " The contribution of institutions to a certain field is very important; the three most productive sources in the field were Washington U. (36, 2.13 The journals with the largest number of publications were 'Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology' (62, 3.66), 'Atherosclerosis' (58, 3.43), and 'Plos One' (48, 2.84) ( Table 2 ). The publication \"Oxidative Stress and Diabetic Complications\" was cited 2370 times. It is the most frequently cited publication and has important guiding significance for the research in this field.\n",
            " Literature coupling reflects the relationship between two bibliographies in terms of similarity of citations. Bibliographic coupling occurs when two papers cite the same reference in their respective bibliographies. This indicates that there may be internal relations and rules between two publications. The journal names of all publications were analyzed by VOSviewer. As can be seen in Figure 3a The publications from 78 institutions were analyzed by VOSviewer and the minimum number of documents for inclusion of an organization was more than 10 ( Figure 3b) . The five universities with the highest TLS were Washington U. (14, 991) , Harvard (13,867), U. of Minnesota (13, 448) , Columbia U. (11, 916) , and Ludwig Maximilians U. (11, 161) .\n",
            " The publications from 29 countries were analyzed by Vosviewer, and only those countries with at least 12 documents were included (Figure 3c) . The five countries with the highest TLS were the United States (187,587), China (136,300), Germany (99,698), Italy (55,450), and The Netherlands (53,720). \n",
            " Co-occurrence analysis refers to the phenomenon that the same or different types of feature items appear together. The purpose of cooperative analysis is to determine popular areas and development directions for cooperative research. This has proved to be very important in the development of science monitoring systems and other disciplines. The title and abstract of the retrieved literature were opened through VOS Viewer software. The software associated the repeated keywords, set the frequency of keyword occurrence not less than 30 times, and generated interactive visual analysis images of the selected keywords through the software. As shown in Figure 4a , the 85 keywords were divided into four clusters: \"molecular level research\", \"mechanism research\", \"in vitro research\", and \"in vivo research\". These results are the most prominent topics in the epigenetic field of atherosclerosis. In the cluster of \"molecular level research\", the main keywords were \"atherosclerosis\" and \"expression\". In the \"mechanism research\" cluster, the main keywords were \"DNA methylation\" and \"methylation\". In the \"in vitro research\" cluster, the main keywords were \"smooth muscle cells\" and \"gene expression\". In the \"in vivo research\" cluster, the main keywords were \"epigenetics\" and \"cardiovascular disease\". The VOS viewer colors keywords are based on the average number of times that they appear in all included publications. Purple means that keywords appear earlier, while yellow means that keywords appear later. Figure 4b shows that most of the studies before 2014 focused on \"mechanism research\" and \"in vitro research\". However, based on trends in recent years, current research pays more attention to comprehensive development. \n",
            " Epigenetic processes are highly dynamic and reversible, and have specific 'writers' and 'erasers' that regulate gene expression. Targeting these epigenetic processes offers a great opportunity for discovery of new ways to prevent and treat atherosclerosis [14] . The VOSviewer supports the import and analysis of literature databases, general network data, and text data [28] . The core idea of the design of VOSviewer is 'co-occurrence clustering', which means that, if two things appear at the same time, they must be related [31] . There are many types of correlation, and their strength and direction are different. Different types of groups can be found by clustering based on the measurement index of relationship strength and direction [32] . Cluster analysis can reveal the research status of a field intuitively, and has great significance for guiding future research trends [33] .\n",
            " With the recognition that epigenetic modifications have a key role in atherosclerosis, the number of publications related to atherosclerosis in the epigenetic field began to increase every year from 1995 to 2020. This shows that atherosclerosis research has experienced rapid development in the field of epigenetics, and that epigenetic studies on atherosclerosis constitute a hot new area. In our study, we used bibliographic coupling analysis to establish similarity relationships between publications in different countries, journals, and institutions. These data indicated that Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology was the most closely related journal. The key words in the titles and abstracts of the included studies were analyzed to yield a map showing the collaborative network [34] . From these results, the research hotspots and future development trends in this field were identified and predicted [35] . Based on the co-occurrence network, we identified four potential research trends: molecular level research, mechanism research, in vitro research, and in vivo research. Our study clarified the association between previous investigations and future research trends.\n",
            " The visualization diagram is similar to the co-occurrence diagram, but the items are colored differently [30] . This effective method is used to monitor research progress [29] . For example, the overlay visualization shows that the study of DNA methylation in atherosclerosis is a hot topic in this field. Moreover, according to our research results, there have been significantly more studies on lncRNA in the field of atherosclerosis since 2017. We speculate that research focused in this direction will become a hotspot in epigenetic studies of atherosclerosis.\n",
            " Our studies have evaluated the trends and current status of atherosclerosis research in the area of epigenetics through bibliometric and visual analysis, the results of which also have some limitations. Although we also searched the keywords related to epigenetic modification repeatedly, we still could not avoid missing relevant articles. In addition, some new, high-quality publications may not receive attention because of their low citation frequency. These problems are the limitations of this article. Researchers need to pay greater attention to the latest published research in related fields, in order to more accurately predict the most important research trends in this field.\n",
            " Although considerable evidence has accumulated demonstrating how epigenetic modification plays an important role in atherosclerosis, more specific research still needs to be explored by scientists. The results of this study summarized the research status of epigenetic modifications in atherosclerosis, and predicted the future research trends in this field. An in-depth study of this field will ensure that we have a more accurate understanding of atherosclerotic disease and provide clear directions for clinical research. The bibliometric data show that atherosclerosis is developing rapidly with the study of DNA methylation, which is currently a hot research area that should be taking its place alongside the previous emphasis on lncRNA studies in atherosclerosis in the field of epigenetics. \n",

            " The onset of new viral pathogens with a high epidemic-pandemic potential is often the result of complex interactions between animals, humans and environment (Coker et al., 2011) . The latter can play an important role in the dynamics of human diseases since it has long been known that climate changes affect human health concerning not only chronic pathologies but also infectious diseases (Epstein, 1999 (Epstein, , 2001 Kovats et al., 2000; Costello et al., 2009; Altizer et al., 2013; Bouzid et al., 2014; Willox et al., 2015) .\n",
            " Favorable climate conditions are necessary for survival, reproduction, transmission and spread of pathogens, of their vectors and hosts. Significant correlations between some climate indicators and the spread of COVID-19 epidemic have been documented (Araújo and Naimi, 2020; Aribi and Sghaier, 2020; Barcelò, 2020b; Bashir et al., 2020) . Indeed, changes in climate conditions can indirectly influence the epidemiology of infectious diseases through the modification of the living environment of the involved etiological agents (Epstein, 2001; Wu et al., 2014) . According to the European Environment Agency (EEA, 2008) , in the 20th century the global average surface temperature has increased by 0.74°C, determining the reduction of the polar caps by 2.7% per decade and the increase of the global sea level of 1.8 mm per year since 1961. These changes have caused the occurrence of extreme weather events in many parts of the world. At the beginning of 2000s, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated an average temperature increase of 1.5-5.8°C during the 21st century, with more and more frequent extreme events such as heat waves, floods and droughts (IPCC, 2001) .\n",
            " Several studies have shown that long-term climate warming can favor the geographic spread of many infectious diseases (Epstein et al., 1998; Rodó et al., 2013; Ostfeld and Brunner, 2015) . Moreover, extreme weather events may influence the epidemiology of infectious diseases determining changes of their spatial and temporal distribution as well as of the intensity of outbreaks and of the global emergency and re-emergency of infectious agents (McMichael et al., 1996; Epstein, 2000; Kuhn et al., 2005; Wu et al., factors, since they have been estimated to cause several million deaths per year worldwide (Lelieveld et al., 2015 (Lelieveld et al., , 2019 . Atmospheric pollutants can induce pro-inflammation and oxidation mechanisms in lungs and other organs, impairing also immune processes. From these evidences, a negative effect of air pollution on the prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 is conceivable. A similar link between pollution and incidence of disease has been studied during the previous SARS epidemic. In 2003, Cui et al. observed that patients living in regions with moderated air pollution levels died more frequently compared to those living in regions with low air pollution levels. Air pollutants can elicit different toxicological mechanisms, such as cytotoxicity through oxidative stress with overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), DNA oxidative damage, mutagenicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and stimulation of pro-inflammatory responses (Di Pietro et al. 2009 , 2011 Visalli et al., 2015) . Moreover, in Italy, during the initial phases of COVID pandemic, remarkable higher mortality rates were observed in northern regions, notoriously more polluted compared to other ones, suggesting a role of pollution in the spread of pandemic (Conticini et al., 2020) . However, current data on COVID-19 spread and mortality could be altered by the different approaches used for studying COVID-19-related deaths and infected people. Recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in countries such as Spain, France, USA and UK having pollution levels very different from those of the northern Italy suggest that in the spread and mortality of COVID-19 are probably involved different variables, among which the age and density of the affected population, its social habits, the policies adopted to contain the diffusion of the infection, and also meteorological conditions (Contini and Costabile, 2020).\n",
            " Like other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, depending on the aerial spread of respiratory droplets, exposes the virus to external environmental conditions. Therefore, the spread of this virus is likely constrained by climate factors. Regarding the potential impact of latitude on the viral transmission, while some authors (Oktorie and Berd, 2020) have suggested as an unlikely event the spread of COVID-19 pandemics at high latitudes or poles, due to their characteristics of remote regions and with low population densities, a growing concern for the transmission to Antarctic wildlife has been reported by other studies (Barbosa et al. 2021) . This aspect could be in relation to the increasing anthropogenic activities in these vulnerable regions of the Earth, stressing the need for suitable containment measures.\n",
            " In this scenario, the outbreak of Coronavirus has been considered as a clear message sent by Gaia 7 et al., 2020; Bar, 2020). Even animal life benefits from the stop of the human activities. The behavioral changes of wild animals such as birds, insects, and street animals indicate the impact that human activities have on living beings. A certain correlation between atmospheric changes and changes in the behavior of animals during lockdown period has also been observed (Bar, 2020).\n",
            " On the other hand, another important feature of COVID-19 pandemic is related to the massive use of disinfectants to counteract the viral transmission. Among these compounds, an extensive analysis of the potential impact on water quality and ecosystem health by the use of chlorine (NaClO) as the cheapest tool to avoid viral transmission, has been reported by García-Avila et al. (2020) . These Authors have underlined that in the environment chlorine is transformed into highly dangerous compounds (i.e. halogenated organic compounds) that are toxic for marine biota, since they can persist in the environment longer than chlorine.\n",
            " Ecotoxicological effects related to the use of disinfectants have been reviewed by SanJuan-Reyes et al. (2021) . Increased concern has also been posed by the amplified plastic pollution consequent to the use of Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) such as protective masks or gloves (Abbasi et al., 2020) , that have stimulated the search for sustainable alternatives (i.e. bio-based plastics, Patrício- Silva et al., , 2021 or recycling practices related to circular economy approaches (Adyel, 2020) . Indeed, COVID-19 pandemic has opened new point of views regarding the management of plastic wastes De-la-Torre et al., 2021 , SanJuan-Reyes et al., 2021 , also in relation to their role as vectors of contaminants, including absorbed antibiotics that can select antibiotic-resistant and biofilm-producing bacterial strains (Laganà et al., 2018 (Laganà et al., , 2019 Caruso, 2019; Patrício-Silva et al., 2021) .\n",
            " All the considerations related to the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aquatic environment stress the need for further studies, addressing the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in aquatic systems while concerted efforts are needed to reduce the load of plastic wastes, in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), such as SDG 14 (United Nations, 2015) .\n",
            " A synthesis of current literature about the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the main environmental compartments (atmosphere, hydrosphere, litosphere, biosphere) is shown in Table 1 However, it has been reported a frequent rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in water systems and that there is no current evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through contaminated drinking-water. Detection of important viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 from urban SARS-CoV-2 is widely reported and this presence can be used to monitor COVID-19 in a community. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in soil even follow the spill of sewage that can act as a source and evidences reported a survival of enveloped viruses in this compartment up to 90 days. However, no paper has been published up to date indicating how this virus could be quantified in soil samples. Table 2 are reported studies about the environmental impact of the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidences show that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an exceptional increase of production, consumption, and disposal of PPE, especially surgical face masks. The overuse of PPEs is determining the increase of plastic pollution especially in water environments. Plastic waste in freshwater and marine environment can be easily ingested by higher organisms, such as fishes, entering in the food chain and potentially determining chronic health problems to humans.\n",
            " Although the main and better-known route of transmission of CoVs is the direct one through the emission of droplets , the environmental survival of SARS-CoV-2 outside the human body and its potential environmental spread via different matrices such as water, air, and food should not be ignored (Núñez-Delgado, 2020). Recently, Yeo et al. (2020) highlighted the potential fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, the release through faeces has been confirmed for SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2005a; Petrich et al., 2006) , MERS-CoV (Zhou and Zhao, 2017) and SARS-CoV-2 (Tian et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b) . Moreover, some researchers focused their attention on the possible CoVs transmission through bioaerosols originated from toilet flushing, as demonstrated by Yu et al. (2004) for SARS-CoV and recently suggested by Ong et al. (2020) for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, an involvement of contaminated food in CoVs transmission can be supposed given the already established survival of the human or animal CoVs on vegetables (Mullis et al., 2013; Yépiz-Gòmez et al., 2013) .\n",
            " The fate of the SARS-CoV-2 in the urban water cycle has raised a great concern in the scientific community, also regarding the pathways of transmission of COVID-19 via building sanitary plumbing systems (Bilal et al. 2020). The need for adequate monitoring programs to evaluate wastewater treatment and fate of urban waters has been underlined, in the light that viral survival and persistence in water systems after wastewater discharge depend on several factors (i.e. temperature, UV or solar inactivation, organic substances, potential competitor microorganisms). The migration pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f aquatic environments have been reviewed by Kumar et al. (2020) . Since most the majority of fecal-oral transmitted viruses are highly persistent in the aquatic environment, the Authors underline that knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 persistence in water is essential to follow viral fate in water, wastewater and groundwater and subsequent human exposure. Therefore, surface water and groundwater represent relevant viral control points through possible leaching and infiltrations of effluents from health care facilities, sewage, and drainage water. In aquatic environments, a literature review on the occurrence, persistence and possible management of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported by Patel et al. (2021) , who have analyzed the main questions related to these issues and suggested the suitability of wastewater-based epidemiology studies to detect the spread of the pandemic.\n",
            " Several studies have been carried out to assess the presence and the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and wastewater, recognizing this environmental compartment as a potential way of exposure to infection (Ahmed et al., 2020; Barcelò, 2020a, b; Corpuz et al., 2020; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020; Nemudryi et al., 2020; Reusken et al., 2020) . Cahill and Morris (2020) have explored the potential risks related to the use of recreational waters, concluding that there have been no reports of humans contracting the SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral transmission to date and therefore the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure to recreational water users is believed to be low, although the potential risk of faecal-oral transmission cannot be excluded where SARS-CoV-2 is present in its infectious state following excretion from human body. At this regard, the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection posed by faecal contaminated water have been assessed by Shutler et al. (2020) , who have reported viral stability within water up to 25 days, and that rivers, waterways and water systems contaminated by high infection rates can provide infectious doses >100 viral copies per 100 ml of water. This issue is mainly related to the evidence that other viruses with the same structural characteristics, such as H1N1 \"Spanish flu\", avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, have been detected in the stools and urine of infected subjects (Wigginton and Ellenberg., 2015) . In this regard, Wang et al. (2005b) showed that SARS-CoV can persist in stools and serum up to 96 h. Also in sewage holding tanks of an international ferry boat, as well as on surface of airconditioners and ventilation systems, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was detected (Mouchtouri et al. 2020 ).\n",
            " Specifically, the Authors assumed the transfer of infected respiratory droplets/nuclei from these surfaces to people standing against the air flow direction.\n",
            " Recent evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater systems has been reported by Ali et al. (2021b) , who have highlighted the presence of this virus in several continents (Europe, Australia, Asia and America), underlying the importance of wastewater-based epidemiology as a new surveillance and prevention tool of viral infectious disease transmission.\n",
            " In general, researches regarding the presence and persistence of viruses in aquatic environments have focused especially on non enveloped enteric viruses, showing a higher resistance in various J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f environmental conditions compared to enveloped ones that are inactivated in water (Wigginton and Ellenberg, 2015; Carducci et al., 2020) . However, in the last decade, some authors have reported the probable presence of enveloped viruses, such as CoVs, in sewage systems (Ikehata et al., 2009; Cantalupo et al., 2011) . In Italy, first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters has been reported by La Rosa et al.\n",
            " (2020a). The survival of CoVs in wastewater can be affected by several variables such as temperature, relative humidity, presence and concentration of suspended solids and disinfection products (Casanova et al., 2010; La Rosa et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2021) . Low temperatures and humidity generally favor high persistence and viability of CoVs (Yeo et al., 2020) . Gundy et al. (2009) reported a decrease of CoVs survival with increasing temperatures in different types of waters (filtered and unfiltered tap water) or wastewaters (filtered and unfiltered primary and secondary effluents). The same authors reported also that the CoVs T99.9 (time for 99.9% of virus titer decrease), in filtered tap water, increased from 10 to ~100 days when temperature decreased from 23°C to 4°C. Moreover, higher T99.9 for the unfiltered wastewater compared to that for the filtered one at the same environmental temperature (23 °C) was observed, suggesting that a higher solid content in water/wastewater could exert a protective effect on the virus and increase its survival in the environment. This was also in agreement with the hydrophobicity of the envelope, responsible for a lower virus solubility in water and a major rate of viral adhesion on solid particles (Gundy et al., 2009) .\n",
            " Viruses are the most abundant particles in all the environments, including seas and oceans where they are present in a concentration of about 10-fold greater than prokaryotic (Suttle, 2005 (Suttle, , 2007 . Previous studies have highlighted that marine viruses play a critical role in determining aquatic communities and influencing ecosystem dynamics (Bergh et al., 1989; Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990; Suttle et al., 1990) . In marine waters, viruses are present at a concentration ranging from about 10 7 to 10 10 L -1 , while in marine sediments from 10 7 to 10 10 g -1 of dry weight. Many studies showed that viruses are abundant especially in surface water and subsurface sediments where their concentration exceeds by 10-1000 times that recorded along the water column (Paul et al., 1993; Maranger and Bird, 1996; Danovaro and Serresi, 2000; Danovaro et al., 2002 Danovaro et al., , 2008a . Some authors found a significant difference in viral abundance among different marine habitats. Specifically, the highest viral presence was found typically in low-salinity coastal waters (Culley and Welschmeyer, 2002; Corinaldesi et al., 2003; Clasen et al., 2008) , and surface coastal sediments (Danovaro et al., 2008b) , decreasing up to three orders of magnitude in deep waters and sea sediments (Hara et al., 1996; Magagnini et al., 2007; Danovaro et al., 2008a, b) . Virioplankton abundances were also found to decrease moving from productive coastal zones to oligotrophic offshore surface waters (Wommack and Colwell, 2000; Corinaldesi et al., 2003; Payet and Suttle, 2008) .\n",
            " Many characteristics of waters, such as temperature, salinity, turbulence and nutrient availability, remarkably influence viral presence in marine ecosystems, because they affect the presence, distribution and metabolism of the planktonic cells acting as viral hosts (Wommack and Colwell, 2000; Weinbauer, 2004) . This is supported by the previously documented significant positive correlation between the viral production and prokaryotic growth rate (Glud and Middelboe, 2004; Mei and Danovaro, 2004; Danovaro et al., 2008b) .\n",
            " As SARS-CoV-2 can reach the marine environment through human fecal emissions and, therefore, Rimoldi et al., 2020). Ye et al. (2016) showed that the coronavirus MHV (Murine Hepatitis Virus) in raw wastewater underwent a 90% reduction in its infectivity after 13 h at 25°C, but remained longer infectious (36 h) at 10°C. The collected evidences suggested that after excretion whole coronavirus particles probably may survive in wastewater depending on different environmental conditions, and, after discharge into aquatic habitats, they may reach coastal marine waters where, however, undergo considerable damage and loss of infectivity. Studies showed that in seawater different viruses, both of eukaryotes and phages, experience particle decay, at different rates, as a result of sunlight (UV-C radiation) and interaction with nucleases and proteases present in marine microorganisms and free in water (Heldal and Bratbak, 1991; Wommack et al., 1996; Noble and Fuhrman, 1997; Wilhelm et al., 1998) . However, the decay of CoVs in natural waters has not been studied.\n",
            " Concerning the presence of CoVs in biota, members of the family Coronaviridae are known to infect not only birds and mammals, but also invertebrates, reptiles, amphibian and even fish (Bukhari et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2018 , Mordecai et al., 2019 . Confirmed associations of CoVs with aquatic biota have been listed by Wartecki and Rzymski (2020) , who have suggested the role of aquatic environments inhabited by large populations of flock-forming or colony-forming waterfowls and frequently visited by bats, as possible hotspots of CoVs, with potential cross-species transmission. Regarding marine biota, to date there is no evidence of Betacoronaviruses members hosted by marine animals, while members of both Alphacoronaviruses and Gammacoronaviruses have been described in marine mammals (Schütze, 2016; Bossart and Duignan, 2018) such as Alphacoronavirus in the Harbor Seal (Bossart and Schwartz, 1990) , Gammacoronavirus in the Pacific Harbor Seal (Nollens et al., 2010) , Gammacoronavirus in the Beluga Whale J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008) and Gammacoronavirus in the Bottlenose Dolphin (Woo et al., 2014) .\n",
            " However, it must be noted that although these viruses are associated with respiratory diseases in pinnipeds and cetaceans, they are poorly similar to SARS-CoV-2 because both Gammacoronaviruses and Alphacoronaviruses share little homology with the new CoV. Wild birds are known to be viral reservoirs, and birds living in marine environment are also known to harbor CoVs. For example, a novel coronavirus, member of the Gammacoronaviruses, was identified in American herrings and great black backed gulls (Canuti et al., 2019) . Interestingly, these sea bird CoVs belong to the same clade of marine mammal CoVs, suggesting that a possible spillover between these animals has occurred. Marine Gammacoronaviruses have morphology, genome organization, and replication highly similar to human CoVs (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008; Woo et al., 2014) . While no marine Gammacoronavirus has been cultivated, experiments using the avian Gammacoronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) have shown that it shares with human CoVs similar entry, replication and shedding. Moreover, while it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 recognize the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its cellular receptor , IBV binds to sialic acid but, despite it infects primarily respiratory tissues, both they may have a wide cell tropism and can infect multiple sites (Winter et al., 2006; Promkuntod et al., 2014; Bande et al., 2016) .\n",
            " aquatic food animals or their products, highlighting that despite this virus is not a foodborne virus, it can survive on contaminated cold-chain food sources. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 does not replicate in cold blood organisms who have a different ACE2 cell receptor and therefore it is unlikely that human consumption of aquatic animals or their products can transmit SARS-CoV-2, as well as that marine CoVs that are neither zoonotic nor closely related to human CoVs can cross the species barrier.\n",
            " The COVID-19 pandemic is having an impressive impact on human society and activities forcing the The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the environment and the involvement of others animal species have been reviewed in this study. The presence and persistence of this virus in the environment, especially in aquatic environments, have been the subject of several studies. However, from the currently available J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f scientific evidences, it is possible to assume that due to the high decay rates and the high dilution rates, SARS-Cov-2 and CoVs in general are not able to persist in natural habitats for long time periods. This would minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection of any susceptible host that potentially could act as a viral reservoir. However, since terrestrial mammals and cetaceans have, similarly to humans, on ACE2 the receptor binding domains, surviving virions may potentially infect these animals especially near urban wastewater outfalls (Nabi and Khan, 2020) .\n",
            " In conclusion, CoVs as free persistent virions, especially in marine and freshwater ecosystems, are not frequent, but this could depend on the limited knowledge of the viral diversity in aquatic reservoirs (Mordecai and Hewson, 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020b) . Current understanding of the potential risk represented by the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in marine environments can be improved by a much broader monitoring and analysis of the dynamics of viral spread through further studies on this issue.\n",
            " Citizens around the world are making responsible efforts to reduce viral transmissions and preserve human health. The pandemic teaches us that the same commitment must be dedicated to protecting and preserving the health of the planet Earth. Choosing more sustainable actions for the planet represents the greatest challenge for the future of humanity. In this scenario, actions such as supporting the recovery and development of impacted communities, favoring the resilience of coastal ecosystems and safeguarding their services are strongly recommended (Steven et al., 2020 ; United Nations Environment Programme-Mediterranean Action Plan, 2020).\n",

Samples from receiving rivers (two sites, sampled in the same dates as wastewaters) showed in some cases a positivity to PCR amplification, probably due to non-treated discharges, or the combined sewage overflows. Nevertheless, also for rivers vitality was negligible, indicating the absence of sanitary risks. Aquatic food does not present the big danger to the human population as was initially feared due to the association of early outbreaks to seafood markets and indicate areas needing more research. 1\n",

            "Body Text: Waste management plants are well known for their significant impact on environment and human lives [1] . Processes related to management, treatment and disposal of wastes are potential sources of harmful compounds emissions into the water, soil and air [1] [2] [3] . Concerning emissions into the air following substances may be considered as a threat: CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , NH 3 , NO x , H 2 S, HCl, HF, dioxins, furans, PAHs and VOCs [3, 4] . Many of these compounds are odorants and literature shows that their emission is one of the most significant problems associated with waste management plants. Indeed, prolonged exposure of inhabitants living in the neighborhood of this type of facilities can deteriorate their living quality by causing odor nuisance [5] [6] [7] [8] . Moreover, increase in the amount of generated wastes, resulting from the development of societies, will cause growth in number of waste management plants and thus, intensification of waste treatment and disposal processes [2, 5, 6, 9] . As a result, more people will be exposed in the future to excessive emission of odorants caused by waste management.\n",
            " As shown on Figure 1 , the waste management system is based on several steps and each one of them can be a potential source of odorants, i.e., collection, transport, treatment and disposal of wastes (mechanical-biological treatment facilities, composting plants, landfills, waste incinerators) [10] [11] [12] [13] . The first step in the waste management chain is the collection of wastes by residents at households and residential areas and their transport by specialized vehicles to the adequate facilities for treatment and disposal. Collected wastes can be transported directly to their final destination or temporary stored at a waste transfer station. Among the disposal and treatments methods the most advanced technologically is the mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) of wastes. The main purpose of the MBT is to recover useful materials (e.g., biogas, compost) and reduce the amount of wastes directed for landfilling. The MBT facilities are probably the most important odor sources along the waste treatment chain, mainly due to the employment of biological methods of waste decomposition, i.e., composting (aerobic treatment) or/and fermentation (anaerobic treatment). The latter process is crucial for emission of odorous substances [2, 7, 9] . Moreover, chemical composition of those volatile mixtures can vary depending on the type of waste being processed, the stage of waste decomposition, the selected treatment method and its operating conditions, i.e., temperature, humidity or aeration [4, 10, 14] . The way that every step in waste management system is carried out can vary on national, regional and local scales [13] . Literature provides information on the chemical composition of odorous mixtures emitted from different stages of waste management (Table 1) . Those odorants can be divided into several chemical groups, i.e., sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, hydrocarbons (unsaturated and saturated), aromatics, terpenes, halogenated compounds, volatile fatty acids, carbonyls, and alcohols. The variety of these substances as well as the complexity of waste management processes constitute a serious challenge in the monitoring of emitted odorants and odors, which requires two different but complementary approaches: analytical (e.g., GC-MS, gas sensors) and sensory (e.g., dynamic olfactometry), respectively [15] .\n",
            " In dynamic olfactometry the determination of odor concentration, expressed in ou/m 3 , is achieved by presenting a sample to a panel of trained persons according to specific procedures (e.g., PN-EN 13725) [16] . However, information about its chemical composition can not be delivered from these measurements. On the contrary, GC-MS method gives concentrations of individual odorants, expressed in ppb or ppm, but this tells us very little about the perceived odor or interactions between odorants in the investigated mixture [17] [18] [19] . An interesting approach is to combine GC-MS with a sniffing port (GC-O-MS) so each chemical component of the analyzed odor is led to a human nose for evaluation. However, still, information about the total odor concentration or odorants complicated interactions can not be achieved with this method [20, 21] . Table 1 . Chemical composition of odorous mixtures from different stages of waste management.\n",
            " Collection and transport ethanol, dimethyl sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl disulfide, propylene, ethyl acetate, NH 3 , methacrolein, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, methyl chloride and m-,p-xylene [7, [22] [23] [24] Waste transfer stations ethanol, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl disulfide, H 2 S, propanal, m,p-xylene, methacrolein, acrolein, NH 3 , benzene, toluene, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, and butyric acid.

For the waste management plants specific analyses of H 2 S and NH 3 are of high interest. However, odorous samples are usually composed of hundreds of different molecules and since, it is difficult to fabricate selective sensors for each one of them, this method may not take into account all prevailing substances. Multi-sensor arrays can cover wide spectrum of substances due to the unspecific sensors. After training with the GC-MS technique they have the potential to continuously provide information on the chemical composition of odorous samples. Moreover, training with olfactometry measurements is also possible. The measured odor concentrations are in this case expressed in ou/m 3 [33] . Both, single gas sensors and multi-sensor arrays can be applied on site for the constant monitoring of air quality [34] . Construction of an EN is a challenging task and can be affected by many factors, mainly associated with the selection of sensors, development of models and quality of data used for their training. Table 2 summarizes the sensory and analytical measurement methods. It is hard to compare these techniques since each one of them provide different type of informations. Therefore, choice of the appropriate method has to be made on a case by case basis depending on the specific needs. An advanced way to analyze odorous substances is to combine olfactometry, GC-MS and EN as complementary approaches to a given task and thus, obtain maximum informations on the analyzed samples [35] . The next sections provide description of different methods discussed briefly above. Olfactometry, GC-MS, GC-O-MS and single gas sensors are presented in Sections 2 and 3. Examples of applications of these techniques to the waste treatment plants are given.\n",
            " Electronic noses are the core of this review and are described in details in Section 4. A special attention is given to the gas sensors used for EN systems construction. Indeed, different types of detectors are discussed and current trends in sensitive layers development are described. Additionally, relatively new EN based on flash GC technology are considered as recent studies showed that they are suitable for monitoring of odorous samples from landfills [36] . Data pre-processing and classification methods are addressed as well. Algorithmic solutions to common problems associated with EN (e.g., signal drift, ambient temperature changes) are given and current challenges in data processing are discussed. At the end of this section examples of commercially available EN are listed with special attention to devices dedicated to the odorous samples investigations. Although several reviews on EN has been published recently [37] [38] [39] , they focus usually on devices made of gas sensors. We took into account EN based on other technologies and compared them with classical approach.\n",
            " Examples of applications of EN for analytical and sensory measurements in the waste management plants are given in Sections 5 and 6. A few review papers summarize efforts of scientists on development of EN for odor impact assessment [39] [40] [41] . Although, examples of applications of these devices to the waste treatment plants appeared in these papers, they represented just a small part of the discussion. The present survey focus solely on EN used for the odor impact assessment in the vicinity of these facilities and thus, fully exhaust the topic.\n",
            " Some authors tried also to review the problem of different processes monitoring using, among many others, EN, e.g., anaerobic digestion [42] or composting [43] . Once again EN represented just a small part of a bigger picture and thus, only few examples of application of these devices were listed in mentioned papers. Our review focuses on EN development for the monitoring of the mechanical-biological treatment of waste and presents numerous examples of applications of these devices for the investigation of composting, anaerobic digestion or bio-filtration processes.\n",
            " In summary, this review describes efforts of scientists on development of EN and their applications for odor impact assessment in the vicinity of waste management plants and monitoring of odorants emitted during mechanical-biological treatment of waste. Therefore, the paper presents two approaches to the problem of the odorous mixtures investigation with electronic noses: a sensory and analytical one.\n",
            " Sensory measurements employ a panel of human noses in conjunction with the olfactometer-an instrument which dilutes analyzed sample with odor-free air, in order to determine odor concentration. Two standardized methods of sample presentation to the panel are applied: forced choice and yes/no method. In the first one two sniffing ports are used but the odor sample is presented only at one of them. The examiner has to choose the port from which she/he perceives the odor. In the second method examiner sniffs from a single port and communicates if an odor is detected or not [16, 44, 45] .\n",
            " Odor mixtures at different dilutions are presented to examiners for sniffing usually in an ascending order. The process continues until each person positively detects an odor in the diluted mixture which means that the panel has reached the detection threshold for that odor [16] . The threshold is calculated as the geometric mean between the dilution of the last negative answer and the dilution of the first positive answer. The odor concentration (C) is expressed as the dilution required for achieving the panel detection threshold and can be described with the equation:\n",
            " where V od is the volume of odorous sample and V f is the volume of air required to reach the threshold. By analogy, for a dynamic olfactometer the concentration is given by:\n",
            " where Q od is the flow of odorous sample and Q f is the flow of odor-free air required to reach the threshold. The concentration is usually expressed in ou/m 3 [16] .\n",
            " Since the sensitivity to odors is variable among people, the examiners could measure different odor concentrations for the same sample. This effect is minimized by a careful selection of assessors with average olfactive sensitivity according to a standardized procedure [16] . The selection of examiners is performed using a reference odorant, usually n-butanol. Only persons with average n-butanol odor threshold in the range of 20-80 ppb and the antilog standard deviation for individual responses less than 2.3 are selected. Examiners must be continuously tested, trained and obey a simple behavior code (e.g., no smoking before measurements, exclusion from measurements during illness caused by cold, etc.) [16] .\n",
            " The panel referability to the standard odorant and the coherence of panel responses determine the quality of olfactometric measurements. In order to guarantee the referability, the laboratory performances are evaluated by accuracy and precision measures. The coherence of panel results is assured by a validation procedure that indicates panel member who gives invalid responses. If the threshold value given by an examiner does not meet certain criterion, then all measures provided by this person must be eliminated [16] .\n",
            " Except for the odor concentration other parameters can be measured with olfactometry as well, namely odor intensity and hedonic tone. Perceived odor intensity is the relative strength of the odor above its detection threshold. The intensity is usually represented by some kind of a category scale (i.e., weak, strong), by subjective magnitude estimates (i.e., odor X is twice as strong as odor Y) or by reference to a specific odorant, whose concentration is adjusted until both, the reference and analyzed sample have the same perceived intensity [46] . Usually, the panelists must assess the odor intensity of the sample according to a specified category scale. The most commonly applied scale counts seven categories from \"no odor\" to \"extremely strong odor\" [47] .\n",
            " Odor concentration and intensity are related. The perceived intensity increases with increasing odor concentration. Two models have been proposed to explain relation between those two parameters. The Weber-Fechner one produces a linear plot of intensity against log concentration:\n",
            " Steven's law turns-out a linear plot of log intensity against log concentration:\n",
            " where I is the intensity, C the odorant concentration and a, b, k, n are the constants. The choice of the model depends on the representation of odor intensity. When category scale is used, the Weber-Fechner law shall be applied. When magnitude or reference scales are used, Steven's law gives better results [46] . Hedonic tone defines the pleasantness and unpleasantness of an odor and is evaluated according to a category scale ranging from −4 (extremely unpleasant) through zero (neither pleasant nor unpleasant) to +4 (extremely pleasant) [47] . The hedonic tone and intensity can be used as parameters for odor impact and odor annoyance assessment by residents living in the neighborhood of industrial activities [48] .\n",
            " Dynamic olfactometry is used to characterize odor emission sources and requires collection and transportation of the samples to the laboratory. For this reasons this technique is not sufficient to asses the odor impact on citizens living in the vicinity of an odor source. Therefore, the application of dynamic olfactometry requires combination with dispersion modelling [49, 50] . These mathematical models merge olfactometry results with meteorological and geographical data and calculate how the emitted odor is transported through the air to the people living in the neighborhood of a particular odor source [51, 52] .\n",
            " The field olfactometer is a portable device that allows to evaluate odors concentrations on site which is the main advantage of this technique as compare to the dynamic olfactometry [53] . A field olfactometer creates a series of dilutions by mixing the odorous ambient air with odor-free (carbon-filtered) air. Number of dilutions needed to make the odorous ambient air non detectable is defined as the Dilution-to-Threshold ratio [54] . Therefore, field olfactometry does not provide directly a measure of the odor concentration in ou/m 3 . Disadvantages of this technique include: odor fatigue (it is difficult not to expose the examiner to the odorous environment before the olfactometer is actually used), lack of dilution options and inability to test examiners with a reference odorant. Besides, it is difficult to remain objective when seeing sources of odor emissions.\n",
            " Olfactometry is widely used for odor impact assessment in the vicinity of waste management plants. For example, a facility characterized by nine point and one area (landfill) odor sources was investigated recently [52] . Odor concentrations were measured by dynamic olfactometry and dispersion modelling was performed for two scenarios. In the first one both, the area and point emission sources are taken into consideration. Second scenario was conducted only for the point sources. It was concluded that the landfill is mainly responsible for odor nuisance caused by the plant and that closing this particular odor source will significantly improve air quality nearby. Indeed, dynamic olfactometry in combination with dispersion models is a useful tool for the optimization of odor mitigation strategies [55] , but a great care must be taken when developing these models as recent studies suggest that modeling choices may lead to a variance in the resulting odor concentrations at receptors differing by up to a factor 3 [56] .\n",
            " Field olfactometry measurements can also be used as input variables in odor distribution modeling. The application of this method was demonstrated recently on a case study of a municipal landfill [53] . Moreover, local planning strategies based on odor dispersion modelling were proposed in order to improve air quality in the vicinity of the facility.\n",
            " Gutiérrez et al. [57] showed that dynamic olfactometry may be used not only to feed dispersion models, but also to monitor composting process. Authors measured odor concentrations emitted during the composting of organic fraction of municipal solid wastes. Good correlation between odor concentration and traditional (i.e., physical-chemical and respirometric) variables was achieved. Moreover, olfactometric detection limit and the compost respirometric stability were reached simultaneously, suggesting that olfactometry is a sufficient and simple method to assess compost stability.\n",
            " Dynamic olfactometry may also be used as a tool for evaluation of the efficiency of purifying odorous gases by bio-filtration [58, 59] . Measurement of concentrations of individual pollutants by means of GC-MC does not always allow to assess the degree of olfactory pollution. Therefore, dynamic olfactometry is a very useful tool for this purpose since it allows to determine the degree of total deodorization efficiency. Efficiency of two filters, i.e., mineral and organic one was compared recently. Odor reduction of respectively 60.8% and 97.2% was achieved. An important aspect of this research was the evaluation of hedonic quality of analyzed samples since organic filters themselves are characterized by an intense natural odor [58] .\n",
            " Wiśniewska et al. [60] investigated odor nuisance in the close vicinity of a biogas plant by means of field olfactometry. Obtained results were compared with H 2 S and (CH 3 ) 2 S analytical concentrations measured by portable GC-PID detector. Odor concentration values were in line with odorants content in the investigated samples and strongly related to the concentration of H 2 S. Authors noted also a strong relationship between odor nuisance, technological process used in the plant and the type of treated waste. These results suggest that field olfactometry is an appropriate method of process control carried out in biogas plants. Presented above applications are summarized in Table 3 . Table 3 . Examples of recent applications of sensory measurement in the waste treatment plants.\n",
            " Methodology Main Outcome of the Work Ref.\n",
            " Dynamic olfactometry, \"Operat Fb\" dispersion model Landfill was mainly responsible for odor nuisance caused by the waste management plants [52] Odor impact assessment Dynamic olfactometry, CALPUFF dispersion model Dispersion models are efficient tools for odor mitigation strategies investigation [55] Odor impact assessment Dynamic olfactometry, CALPUFF dispersion model Modeling choices may lead to a variance in the resulting odor concentrations [56] Odor impact assessment Field olfactometry, CALPUFF dispersion model Exposure to odor nuisance is an important factor in urban areas management and planning [53] Composting process monitoring\n",
            " Dynamic olfactometry (supported by physical-chemical and respirometry measurements)\n",
            " Dynamic olfactometry is a sufficient and simple method to assess compost stability [57] Monitoring of anaerobic digestion process Field olfactometry (supported by GC-PID)\n",
            " Field olfactometry can be used for both, odor impact assessment and monitoring of anaerobic digestion processes [60] (Bio)filtration efficiency assessment\n",
            " Dynamic olfactometry Organic filter presents higher deodorization efficiency than mineral one [58] \n",
            " Identification of individual odorants is difficult without using a separation technique. Therefore, gas chromatography is frequently applied for this task, and is often coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The latter allows identification and quantification of the species present in the analyzed sample. Since level of some odorants can be as low as ppb or even ppt, the pre-concentration techniques are commonly used before the actual analysis (e.g., adsorption of the odorants on active carbons followed by thermal desorption) [61] . The GC-MS technique gives informations that are fundamental to evaluate the impact of emitted compounds on the environment and human health. In the same time, GC-MS measurements are expensive, time-consuming and not suitable for on site applications.\n",
            " It is also very difficult to relate the chemical composition of an odorous mixture to its odor concentration. One approach is to calculate the odor activity value (OAV) defined as the sum of the ratio between the chemical concentration of each compound in the mixture and its odor threshold concentration [41] :\n",
            " where OAV is the odor activity value (ou/m 3 ), C i is the concentration of the compound i (mg/m 3 ) and OT i is the odor threshold of the compound i (mg/ou). Indeed, this method allows to estimate the odor concentration in the case of samples containing few odorants but real samples are usually very complex and odor concentrations calculated through OAV can be highly imprecise [62, 63] . One source of misleading results is the difficulty of obtaining reliable odor threshold values. Sometimes literature screening gives OT values for a given odorant that differ by several orders of magnitude [64] . Moreover, different types of interactions between compounds may occur (synergic or masking effects), resulting in odors that can be hardly related to the chemical composition [65] .\n",
            " GC-O-MS combines two techniques: olfactometry and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. After separation the eluted flux is divided between the MS detector and the olfactory port for the chemical and sensory evaluation, respectively [66, 67] . This technique provides detailed information on individual odorants presented in the analyzed mixture and allows to estimate their relative influence on the total odor of the sample. In the same time, the olfactory properties of the sample as a whole can not be obtained. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the odor concentration or provide information about the odor impact using this method. Similarly to the GC-MS, the GC-O-MS measurements are expensive, time-consuming and not suitable for on site applications [41] .\n",
            " Selective detection of certain odorants can be achieved through gas sensors. Devices based on electrochemical principle of detection are well suited for this task [68] . A typical electrochemical sensor set-up consists of three electrodes: the working, the reference and the counter electrode. The operating principle of an electrochemical sensor is based on the measuring current flow changes generated by reduction or oxidation of target molecules at the working electrode surface. The changes in the current flow are proportional to the measured gas concentration [69] . This type of sensors are usually highly selective and quite sensitive. However, there is a limited number of molecules that can be measured using this technique (e.g., SO 2 , NO 2 , NH 3 , H 2 S, HCHO, glutaraldehyde) [32] .\n",
            " A very important type of gas sensors are nondispersive infrared detectors (NDIR). The sensor set-up consists of a source of infrared radiation in alignment with a detector. When an analyzed gas enters the measurement chamber, it absorbs radiation of a particular wavelength causing decrease in light intensity reaching the detector. This reduction of infrared radiation is proportional to concentration of target molecules. An important element of the sensor is an optical filter, which passes absorbed light of defined wavelength, thus providing selectivity of particular sensor [70] . Similarly to the electrochemical sensors, the NDIR detectors are highly selective and can be used for CH 4 , CO and CO 2 measurements. Although, non of these molecules can be considered as an odorant, the monitoring of methane content is of high interest when investigating, for example, the stability of the composting pile [71] .\n",
            " Specific gas sensors mentioned above are often applied together with electronic noses or even integrated to the construction of the device in order to increase its selectivity and provide complementary informations on the analyzed samples (e.g., Olfosense from Airsense).\n",
            " The photoionization detector (PID) is another type of sensors that is often applied during the investigation of odorous samples. PID detects molecules that are ionized under the influence of radiation emitted by the UV lamp (their ionization energy is lower than the energy of the emitted photons). The presence of the ionization products is recorded by an electrometer [32] . Contrary to the electrochemical and NDIR detectors, PID ones are not selective. However, these sensors provide informations about the total amount of VOCs present in the analyzed samples and thus, can be a valuable addition to the multi-sensor arrays (e.g., Olfosense from Airsense).\n",
            " GC-MS is a very powerful technique for the monitoring of odorants emitted during different stages of the waste management chain. Liu et al. [7] investigated recently VOCs released during initial decomposition of municipal solid waste, that occurs during waste collection, transportation and early pre-treatment. Ethanol was the dominant compound in these samples and identified as one of the main odorants (together with methyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide and ethyl acetate). Moreover, authors calculated the odor activity value (OAV) following Equation (5) mentioned above. The easily biodegradable waste (EBW) proportion in waste is the dominate source of VOCs generation. Indeed, when the proportion of EBW was reduced from 60% to 15%, the OAV decreased from 244.51 to 61.46. However, validation of obtained results with dynamic olfactometry was not performed.\n",
            " Composting can also be a source of odorous molecules and the waste origin plays a crucial role on the chemical composition of those substances. Sulfides, followed by acid/esters, ketones, alcohols, and terpenes are produced during composting of food wastes whereas terpenes, followed by aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones and alkanes are emitted from yard wastes. Addition of paper to the yard or food wastes results in formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and alkanes at the beginning of the composting process [72] . Similar VOCs were detected by Agapios et al. [73] during household composting of food wastes. Moreover, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was also applied to explore the entire data set, including VOCs and physicochemical parameters for monitoring of the composting process in terms of compost maturity and biological activity. Indeed, emission of terpenes during the composting was related to the immature phase of the process, whereas high content of sulfides was associated with intense biological activity.\n",
            " Single gas sensors are also widely used for the monitoring of odorants emitted during different waste treatment processes. Electrochemical ammonia sensor was used for the evaluation of the efficiency of NH 3 removal from composting gases by bio-filtration [74] . Municipal solid wastes, digested wastewater sludge and animal by-products were composted in a pilot-scale reactor and the exhaust gas was treated in a biofilter. The NH 3 removal efficiency of 95.9% was obtained in the described experiment for the first two waste sources but declined significantly in the case of animal by-products.\n",
            " Wiśniewska et al. [75] used a portable multi-gas analyzer, MultiRae Pro, equipped with one PID detector and three electrochemical sensors to measure H 2 S, NH 3 and methanethiol for the monitoring of odorants emitted from biogas plants. The highest concentrations of odorants were associated with oxygen stabilization of digestate (VOCs, NH 3 ) and with technological wastewater generated at biogas plants (mainly NH 3 ). Authors suggested that, the detector can be used to control technological processes by measuring the odorant concentrations and calculating the odour activity value (OAV). Based on the results, it should be possible to plan the activities aimed at minimizing the odour nuisance related to the presence of specific compounds in the process gases. However, validation of proposed method with dynamic olfactometry was not performed.\n",
            " Mabrouki et al. [76] , proposed a system to monitor the biogas generated from a landfill placed near the Morocco City and update the database remotely. The Internet of Things system consisted of Arduino Uno R3 Card, Wi-Fi module and Bluetooth module and set of gas sensors (CH 4 , CO 2 , CO, O 2 , NO 2 and H 2 S) was used for this purpose. Biogas emitted form the landfill was rich in methane and carbon dioxide, but the exact content of the analyzed samples depended strongly on the season (water content) and the waste deposit age. Presented above applications are summarized in Table 4 . \n",
            " The term \"electronic nose\" comes from some similarities between the analysis of volatile compounds in air using a set of gas sensors and the human olfactory system. Upon being sniffed through the nose, inhaled air reach the olfactory epithelium located in the upper nasal cavity [77] . Interactions of odorous molecules with the olfactory receptors produce electrical stimuli which are transmitted to the brain. There, a pattern recognition process assisted by the memory takes place in order to identify, classify and perform an hedonic analysis of the particular smell [78] . A single olfactory receptor responds usually to several odorants and each odorous molecule can interact with multiple olfactory receptors [79] . Similarly, working principle of the EN is based on the cross-reactivity and semi-selectivity of the gas sensors used to design the sensors array. The interactions of volatile compounds with these sensors give rise to analytical signals which are then processed by the computer via a pattern recognition program. Just like humans, EN can learn new patterns and associate them with new odors via training and data storage. The working principle of human and EN is presented on Figure 2 . Operationally, an EN is composed of three parts: a sampling system, an array of chemical gas sensors producing signals when confronted with volatile compounds and an appropriate pattern-classification system [80] . At present, most of the EN are based on semiconducting metal oxides or conductive polymers gas sensors. However, other types of sensors including electrochemical, piezoelectric and optical sensors are also used [81] . Although not precisely being gas sensors, mass spectrometry and gas chromatography based EN provide an interesting alternative to the classical EN and will be presented briefly later.\n",
            " The sampling system includes a chamber that hosts a sensor array mounted on a PCB card and a sample flow control unit (miniature membrane pump, flow meters and valves). Analytical signals received from sensors arrays are processed in three steps: data pretreatment, feature extraction and dimension reduction, and pattern recognition algorithms. EN found applications in many fields: food freshness and quality control (e.g., wine authenticity) [82] [83] [84] [85] , agriculture [86, 87] , disease detection (e.g., cancer, tuberculosis) [88] , drugs detection (e.g., cannabis) [89] , and security (e.g., fire warning, detection of explosives) [90] [91] [92] . EN are also increasingly used to monitor the indoor and outdoor air quality [34, 39, [93] [94] [95] .\n",
            " Gas sensors are transducers that transform chemical interactions between a sensitive layer and volatile molecules into an electrical signal. Many methodologies can be used for chemical sensing of gaseous compounds including chemiresistive, electrochemical, optical and piezoelectric sensors ( Figure 3 ).\n",
            " Electrochemical principle of detection is presented in Section 3.3 (and on Figure 3a ). Chemiresistive gas sensors (Figure 3b ) have a relatively simple configuration. The sensitive layer is deposited between two electrodes or on top of an interdigitated electrode. The interaction between the sensitive layer and the target gas molecules leads to resistance change of the sensor, mostly through the exchange of charge carriers [95] .\n",
            " Piezoelectric (QCM-Quartz Crystal Microbalance or SAW-Surface Acoustic Wave) sensors makes use of the piezoelectric property of the quartz crystal, which oscillates under an applied voltage across two gold electrodes, one of which is covered with the sensitive layer ( Figure 3c ). Its resonant frequency changes upon mass loading induced by the gas adsorption on the modified electrode surface [96] . SAW operate at 50-1000 MHz while QCM at 5-30 MHz. SAW devices are more sensitive but also more unstable and require a high-tech control set-up. An optical sensor consists of a light source, a sensing platform, light waveguides and a light detector (Figure 3d ). The sensing mechanism rely on the interactions of light and the sensing layer before and after exposing them to the target gas molecules. Alteration of the light intensity or shift in the wavelength of the light are the basic changes that can occur in the presence of the analytes of interest [97] .\n",
            " The sensitive layer can be made from various materials including semiconducting metal oxides, carbon nanomaterials, conductive polymers, molecularly imprinted polymers, biomolecules. Thanks to theirs electrical properties the first three of the listed above materials are usually applied for the development of gas sensors based on chemiresistive principle of detection.\n",
            " Semiconducting metal oxides (e.g., SnO 3 , ZnO, WO 3 , CuO) have been more widely used to prepare gas sensors than any other class of materials [95] . Metal oxides can be fabricated in form of mico-or nanograins and deposited on a sensing platform as thick-or thin-films. The effect of grain size and film thickness on gas sensing has been investigated by many researchers and it may be concluded that the optimal performances are usually achieved with a thick film of lightly sintered nanocrystalline, porous materials [98] . Gas sensing properties of the metal oxide sensitive layers can be further tuned by using a combination of different metal oxides, addition of metal catalysts or application of hierarchical micro-and nanostructures [99] [100] [101] .\n",
            " Conducting polymers (e.g., polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc.) are easy to synthesize by various chemical and electrochemical approaches and their molecular chain structure can be modified conveniently by copolymerization or structural derivations leading to materials with new gas sensing properties [102, 103] . Similarly to metal oxides, conducing polymers can also be prepared in form of nanoparticles, nanofibers, nanotubes, etc. However, so far, no spectacular improvements of sensing responses have been noticed with these nanostructures as compared to the thin film based sensors [104] . Another approach to improve sensing performances of devices based on conducting polymers is to combine them with other materials (metal, metal oxides, carbon nanostructures or even other polymers) [105, 106] .\n",
            " Carbon nanostructures (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene) have been intensively studied for gas sensing applications recently. Theirs unique electrical properties can be further enhanced by decorating carbon nanotubes or graphene sheets with nanoparticles made of noble metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ag) [107] or metal oxides (e.g., SnO 2 ) [108] . However, nanocarbon-based commercial gas sensors are yet to come as there is still a place for the improvement of gas sensing properties and reduction of production costs of these nanostructures [109, 110] .\n",
            " Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are materials with custom-made binding sites complementary to the target molecules in shape, size and functional groups. Therefore, these materials are tailored at the synthetic level so that the selectivity of the designed sensor is oriented toward desired chemicals. However, it is hard to control the thickness of the MIPs films and thus, gas sensors based on these materials use usually QCM as transducer. The QCM appears a straightforward approach since it measures directly the \"mass\" adsorbed onto the microbalance [111] .\n",
            " Biomolecules, e.g., peptides and DNA also offers a promising option for the development of gas sensitive materials. The use of peptides is in a more advanced status since they represent the \"natural\" extension of the olfactory receptors. However, more studies are necessary to assess the long-term stability of devices based on these materials in real conditions [112] . Biomolecules are mostly used for the development of optical or QCM type gas sensors.\n",
            " Due to theirs mature production technology, suitability to wide range of gases and low price, the main type of sensors applied in e-noses are chemiresistive metal oxide sensors (MOS). Today, several companies, such as Figaro, Sensirion or SGX Sensortech offer this type of devices. The MOS sensors operate at high temperatures (up to 500°C) and thus, they consume relatively high amounts of power: 100 mW per an ordinary sensor. However, with the advancement in electronic devices miniaturization, the size of MOS sensors become smaller through the years: from pin-type to MEMS patch-type ones and thus, energy requirements decreased to tens of mW. Application of multi-walled carbon nanotubes allowed further decrease in power consumption to only 1.05 mW [113] . The MOS sensors are sensitive to humidity changes and can be easily poisoned by high concentrations of volatile fatty acids or sulfur compounds [114] . The detection limit of most of the commercially available MOS sensors are at ppm levels and thus, they cannot be used for applications where analyzed molecules are at lower levels. Two ways to improve the sensitivity of these devices is investigated: development of sensors with lower detection limits by designing new sensitive layers as mentioned above and/or equipping the e-nose with an enrichment technology.\n",
            " The production process of chemiresistive conductive polymers sensors (CPs) is not as mature as MOS ones, but this kind of devices can detect a wide range of gases without heating of the sensitive layer. This endows these sensors with low energy consumption and simple device configuration. They are also resistant to sensor poisoning but, in the same time, are sensitive to humidity and temperature changes. Other disadvantages, namely lack of selectivity, reversibility and stability of these sensing layers has been noted as well. One of the potential interesting approaches to improve CPs sensors is to prepare a hybrid material made of both: conducting polymers and metal oxides. The hybrid material is able to overcome the limitations of their single counterparts such as poor selectivity of conducting polymer and high working temperature of metal oxide, and hence, promotes an effective gas detection [105, 106] . Although few commercial e-noses contain arrays based on conducting polymers (e.g., Cyranose from Sensigent), individual CPs are not available on the market.\n",
            " Chemiresistive carbon nanomaterials sensors (CNs) usually operate at room temperature and thus, consume little amounts of power. Other advantages of CNs sensors include small size, long working life, ultra-high sensitivity, fast response and recovery times. Current studies focus on further improvement of CNs sensitivity, as well as their selectivity and stability. With the development of microelectronics technology, the cost of device manufacturing will drop and thus, the commercialization of sensors based on carbon nanomaterials will be more profitable [115] .\n",
            " The electrochemial sensors operate at room temperature, have low power consumption, long lifetime and are very robust. Moreover, they are not humidity sensitive and are suitable for toxic gases detection (e.g., H 2 S, NH 3 , CO, NO x ). Electrochemical sensors are usually highly selective and thus, less compatible with the operation principles of the EN [116] . Nevertheless, electrochemical sensors are commonly used for construction of electronic tongues dedicated for the analysis of liquid samples [117, 118] .\n",
            " Piezoelectric (SAWs, QCMs) are able to detect various gases at ppb levels in less than 10 s [119] . Besides, diverse sensing materials can be deposited on gold electrodes which increases the range of measured gases and thus, applications of these sensors. The SAWs and QCMs can be prepared with the MEMS technology which decreases their size. This allows to shorten the response and recovery times but, from the other hand, increases their instability, caused by the increased surface-to-volume ratio [120] . There are only a few commercially available devices based on this detection technique (e.g., Biolin Scientific, Quartz Pro) and usually sensitive materials are deposited on electrode on demand which makes these sensors relatively expensive.\n",
            " Optical sensors can measure the concentration of a specific gas in gas mixtures with high sensitivity and selectivity. However, they are relatively expensive, difficult to miniaturize and exhibit low portability due to delicate optical and electrical components [121] .\n",
            " The advantages and disadvantages of gas sensors used in EN are summarized in Table 5 . \n",
            " Mass spectrometers can be used together with chemometric programs to obtain a fingerprint of a particular odor and to proceed to classifications. After injection of volatile mixture an MS pattern is created. Each mass to charge ratio (m/z) acts as a sensor that detects any molecule or fragment with that particular ratio. In this way, an MS-based EN has potentially hundreds of sensors [123] . A big advantage of this system over gas sensors is that it uses a very well-known technology. The stability, reproducibility and sensitivity of mass spectrometers are well established. This offers a solution to some problems associated with classical gas sensors such as sensor poisoning or baseline drift. The MS-based sensors are also not sensitive to environmental changes (i.e., temperature and relative humidity) [85] . However, due to their large size MS electronic noses are less suitable for on site applications than EN based on classical gas sensors. Besides, they are expensive, consume high amounts of power and their construction is complicated [124] .\n",
            " The MS-based EN can be coupled with traditional gas chromatography. However, it is possible to skip this step and inject the sample directly to the mass spectrometer's ionization chamber [125] . Interestingly, multi arrays made of classical gas sensors can be combined with gas chromatography as well (e.g., zNose from Electronic Sensor Technology) which increases applications of this type of devices. EN based solely on flash/fast chromatography present yet another approach for the sensing of odorous mixtures. The Hercales e-nose from Alpha M.O.S is made of two columns with different polarities (and two FID detectors). Therefore, two different chromatographs are obtained during a single analyze. Although most of the available papers present applications of this device for food quality investigations [126] [127] [128] , some studies suggest that it can be used for the monitoring of air quality in vicinity of municipal landfills or evaluation of air quality in the neighborhood of the petroleum plants [129] [130] [131] . Similarly to MS e-noses, the GC-based solutions are expensive, consume high amounts of power and their construction is complicated. Additionally, they require gas carrier gas and the analysis time is relatively long. For these reasons, GC based EN are not foreseen for on site applications. The advantages and disadvantages of GC and MS-based EN are summarized in Table 5 together with classical gas sensors.\n",
            " Data processing methods are summarized on Figure 4 . The dimensionality reduction, signal feature extraction, and data re-scaling methods are generally applied during EN data exploration and pre-processing.\n",
            " The data collected by the EN may consist of several, several dozen or even several hundred variables that may be correlated to a greater or lesser extent [132] . Mutual correlation arises in the case of sensitive layers giving similar responses to the tested VOCs or results from the influence of environmental factors. This effect is usually considered as undesirable because too many dimensions make the data mining process difficult, can significantly extend the time of calculations and cause difficulties in achieving the target success rate when classifying signals. For this reason, dimensionality reduction methods such as Independent Component Correction (ICC) [133] , Orthogonal Signal Correction (OSC) [134] or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used as first data preparation step. In the PCA method, which seems to be the most widely used method nowadays according to [85] , the original data space is transformed in order to produce a new set of uncorrelated variables ordered by reducing variability. This allows to select only those sensors or those signal features that will effectively and significantly affect the classification results. PCA or OSC can be also used for detection of outliers [135] , detection of sub-classes in groups of objects [136] , classification or as EN drift correction method [137, 138] . The aim of a feature extraction methods [139] is to simplify data analysis by extracting robust information from the sensor response. Extracting signal features may also be necessary in some rare cases. Zhang et al. [140] gives an example of an e-nose for the detection of flammable liquids where the measurements were limited to 10 s and the response stabilization was not possible. Feature extraction methods can be divided into three groups: methods that allow to describe a signal using simple scalar values, methods based on curve fitting, and methods based on signal analysis in the frequency or time domain. The first group of methods focuses on extraction of piecemeal signal features from sensor response such as: min/max, difference, fractional difference, primary derivative, secondary derivative, adsorption slope coefficient or area under the response curve [141] . Methods based on curve fitting fit a specific e.g., expotential or polynomial models to the response curves and extract a set of fitting parameters as the signal features [141] [142] [143] . The frequency or time domain analysis methods are based on signal transforms such as Fast Fourier Transform [144, 145] or the Discrete Wavelet Transform [146] [147] [148] and are mainly applied to signals recorded over a long period of time or signals containing cyclical variation. Using features instead of raw signal measurements can help eliminate some additive errors [141] and compensate for the temperature influence on the sensors [149] . Additionally, some of the above mentioned features can be interpreted as physical parameters related to the reaction kinetics. For example, the signal slope coefficient (primary derivative) may represent the rate of the reaction of sensors responding to analytes and secondary derivative may represent the acceleration of the reaction, etc. [140, 141] .\n",
            " The normalization and the standardization are the two primary scaling methods used in machine learning. Normalization typically re-scales the values into a range of [0,1]. Standardization typically re-scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (unit variance). Both transformations allow to keep signal responses from various sensors of an e-nose at the same magnitude level. This step is particularly advised for pattern recognition or classification methods based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as they tend to learn from signals differences [150] . In a case of large differences in raw signal magnitudes, ANN will tend to favor the sensor or sensors with the highest numerical values. It is proven that normalization improves precise identification of the odor concentration and helps to reduce the calculation error of stoichiometric recognition [141] .\n",
            " The modern approach to the signal classification is dominated by data mining methods, which are divided into supervised and unsupervised methods. The main advantage of unsupervised methods is lack of a learning stage and no need to describe the dataset, which in the case of large number of data would be an expensive, laborious, and time consuming operation [151, 152] . PCA and cluster analysis methods such as DBSCAN [153] , Meanshift [154] or k-means clustering [155] are categorized as unsupervised methods. A cluster is a subset of the initial dataset whose data points have one or more features in common which results from sensors reacting to the same volatile substance under similar conditions of temperature and humidity. From computational point of view these features may be: location in the same dense areas of the data space, small distances between cluster members or membership of the same statistical distributions. Two issues limit the applicability of unsupervised methods as automatic classification algorithms. Firstly, clusters are not usually known beforehand, and are calculated by the algorithm starting from random initial locations. This forces the expected number of clusters to be specified as an integer value, before computation begins. In some cases, the optimal number of clusters can be computed or is defined a priori. The second problem is the lack of an unambiguous method or metric allowing to determine the accuracy of the clustering without using the descriptive information provided by an human operator. For this reason, unsupervised methods are mostly used as pre-processing methods [85] .\n",
            " In order to automate e-nose data classification supervised methods such as: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Linear Least Squares regression (LLS) and nonlinear Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers, Random Forest (RF), k-NN classifiers, and artificial neural networks (ANN) are used [85] . Supervised methods tend to produce better results and provide the opportunity to generate a metric such as confusion matrix [156] that can be used to compare or to optimize the results. Of all the various ANN architectures the most used is the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) trained using a cost minimisation function known as the backpropagation algorithm [157] . The MLP (Figure 5a ) consist of one input layer for e-noses signals or signals features, one or more \"hidden\" layers of coefficients (weights and biais) which are interconnected to the hidden layer inputs and outputs and one output layer which holds the classification results. During a finite number of iteration the MLP coefficients are modified (trained) until the error between input labels and target classes is minimized.\n",
            " The SVM working principle is different. The SVM creates a line or a plane which splits data points into classes with the greatest possible margin between the plane and any point within the training set, giving a greater chance of new data being classified correctly. Data points are progressively mapped into higher and higher dimensions (Figure 5b ) in a process known as kernelling [158] , until a hyperplane can be formed to segregate them. Both ANN and SVM methods are widely used in research [38, 143, 159, 160] . According to some authors, the SVM seems to outperform ANN [161] , however, it should be remembered that the results of such comparative studies strongly depend on the data, the configuration, parameter tuning and the choice of ANN architecture. For this reason, when choosing an appropriate method, we should rely on the results of experiments rather than on bibliographic premises. \n",
            " From computational point of view the biggest challenge is to achieve the best accuracy and the lowest level of false positive and false negative detections. For EN operating in a controlled environment e.g., in a lab bench, a 100% success rate in samples classification is often achieved [162, 163] . Indeed, in laboratory conditions it is possible to calibrate e-nose with a wide range of gas concentrations and thus, increase the performance of the system [164] . The interferences from non-target odors present in real samples is also limited. In real live experiments such high accuracy is never reached [165] [166] [167] . An obvious solution to this problem is to increase the number of samples covering wide areas, under different meteorological conditions [166] or increasing the number of sensors [132] , which makes the data analysis more difficult. Although some authors were able to constitute a large (18,000 samples) data set of gas sensor arrays responses in laboratory conditions [168] , the size of a typical data set intended for e-nose training reported in publications is rather limited to 100-500 samples approximately [139, 167, [169] [170] [171] . The number of samples collected in outdoor experiments is sometimes critically low (~50) [172] . Therefore, the success rate of 100% in outdoor conditions published by some authors [173] may be due to a very low number of samples collected.\n",
            " Another challenge is related to machine learning, which in most publications is presented in a simplified manner. A critical step in ANN classificator setup is the determination of right activation function and the optimal number and size of hidden layers. The only guideline in this matter is the knowledge that three-layered networks have sufficient computational degrees of freedom to solve any classification problem [143] . In the case of SVM classification, the most critical step is choosing a suitable kernel of SVMs for a particular application. Various applications need different kernels to get reliable classification results [174, 175] . At the moment, there is no framework that automates the selection of the best architecture or kerneling function. So the success of this crucial stage depends heavily on the authors perseverance and programming skills. Only in a few publications we can find examples of a detailed description of machine learning process with: train and validation loss curves [169] , information about sampling strategy adopted [166] or training, validation, and test sets for unbiased evaluation of models [139] . In other cases, it is usually impossible to extrapolate published results to new problems.\n",

            " Commercially available EN based on semiconducting metal oxide can be purchased (among many others) from Airsense Analytics GmbH (www.airsense.com, accessed on 8 February 2022). The company proposes the PEN series of e-noses (iPEN, PEN2, PEN3) which contain an array made of 10 metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors. The measuring cell can be linked with an adsorbent trapping unit or a headspace auto sampler for laboratory analyses. The company offers also other devices: Olfosense and GDA (GDA-FR, GDA-X). The first one combines MOS technology with PID detectors and electrochemical sensors. The GDA units contain 2 MOS sensor, a PID detector, an electrochemical cell and ion mobility spectrometer (IMS). The PEN and GDA series are portable devices that found applications in environment investigations and security, respectively. The Olfosense aims to set up a Network for Air Quality Monitoring where multiple devices are interconnected, and users keep their eyes in real time on environmental parameters, i.e., odor concentration (ou/m 3 ),VOCs, H 2 S and NH 3 concentrations (from ppb to ppm).The device is provided with a dispersion modelling. Similar approach is proposed by Odotech (www.odotech.com, accessed on 8 February 2022), SACMI (www.sacmi.com, accessed on 8 February 2022) or RubiX (www.rubixsi.com, accessed on 8 February 2022) company.\n",
            " Through the years, Alpha M.O.S (Toulouse, France) developed few EN based on metal oxide semiconducting sensors. Some of them like FOX 2000, 3000, 4000 were based solely on MOS sensors and others (RG BOX, Prometeus) were equipped additionally with electrochemical and PID sensors or mass spectrometry detector. These devices are no longer on the market. Indeed, few years ago the company changed completely direction and released an EN (Heracles Neo) based on ultra fast gas chromatography (www.aplha-mos. com, accessed on 8 February 2022). This e-nose has been described above.\n",

            " Composting is an aerobic process that is used to convert organic waste into agriculturally useful products. Composting can be divided in two phases: high-rate composting phase and a curing phase [176] . An intense microbial activity occurs during the first phase leading to the decomposition of the most biodegradable material. The rest of the material is slowly transformed into humic substances during the second phase. The first phase con-sumes large amounts of oxygen which may lead to anaerobic conditions and thus, a correct air management (air supplier) is necessary to achieve optimal composting conditions. EN are promising tools that allow a constant monitoring of the composting process, assessment of the compost quality, maturity and its biological stability. Romain et al. [177] used an emission chamber equipped with a home-made EN device composed of 7 metal oxide sensors for monitoring of the composting process of household wastes during 60 days. The humidity, temperature and air flow in the chamber were recorded as well. The EN was not set to determine individual chemicals, but whole chemical families (sulphur compounds, alcohols, nitrogen compounds, aldehydes, ketones, esters, acids, furans, dioxins, ethers, terpenes, chlorinated compounds and hydrocarbons). The alcohol family prevails during the whole composting time except in the earlier stages when aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons are the most abundant. A peak of nitrogen compounds and carboxylic acids appears at day 17th and a high increase of the ketones and furans occurs the last days of composting. The peak at day 17th is due to the absence of proper aeration: there was no turning of the pile since 5 days. Ketones and furans are released due to chemical processes which indicates the end of the high-rate composting phase and beginning of the curing phase. Therefore, the presence of these species at the end of the experiment is not surprising.\n",
            " Lopez et al. [71] used commercially available PEN3 e-nose based on metal oxide sensors for the in-situ assessment of compost stability and maturity. A total of 7 different composting piles from a commercial facility located in Spain were investigated. Development of anaerobic conditions was confirmed in some of the experiments as oxygen levels dropped to c.a. 10% leading to changes in volatile organic compounds emissions as it was noticed with the EN measurements. In support of this argument combustible gases were also detected in all these samples with NDIR sensor. Therefore, the EN device is suitable for the classification between aerobic-anaerobic conditions of the composting pile and thus, indication of its stability and quality. Moreover, changes in the chemical composition of gaseous samples with the composting time were recorded and appropriately trained e-nose was used later on to estimate the compost maturity.\n",
            " The PEN3 e-nose was also used for the assessment of the biofiltration efficiency of the composting gases [178] . The pile was fed with kitchen wastes or shredded pruning waste. The air from the pile was extracted by an exhaust fan and distributed upstream to a set of 12 pilot-scale open-top biofilters. The compost gases from the biofilters inlet and outlet ports were monitored for 20 days by the EN and the total VOCs were analyzed by a photoionization detector (PID). The biofiltering process of the emitted gases reached total VOCs removal efficiency greater than 90% as identified by PID. The EN could identify qualitative differences among the biofilter output gases related to its nature and particle size. Sensors detecting sulphur containing-compounds were especially discriminating. The EN could also be used to quantify total VOCs content in air samples during the composting and biofiltering trial.\n",
            " Gutierrez et al. [35] compared 3 complementary approaches to monitor odorants and odors (dynamic olfactometry, GC-MS and EN). The odor source was a green waste compost at different maturity stages located in the south of Belgium. The EN made of 6 Figaro MOS sensors was capable of identifying some chemical families emissions and some activities such as turning steps, whereas the GC-MS detected each individual chemical. Odor concentrations (ou/m 3 ) in relationship with these emissions were determined by dynamic olfactometry. The olfactometry indicated an increase of the odor concentration during the first days of the composting process. The GC-MS measurements shown that odorants responsible for the perceived odor belonged to the following chemical families: terpenes, organic acids, ketones, aldehydes and alcohols like D-limonene, butanoic acid, thujone, hexanal and 2-butanol, respectively. E-nose data were linked to the chemical composition and to the odor concentration.\n",
            " Although most of the EN systems dedicated for the compositing processes monitoring are based on the MOS sensors, other types of sensing devices have been used as well.\n",
            " Lieberzeit et al. [179] designed e-nose based on 6 QCM sensors coated with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP). They enable quantitative monitoring of the most relevant volatile organic compounds, i.e., esters, alcohols and terpenes emitted form the compost process of grass and pine. During the composting authors observed concentrations of up to 250 ppm of esters, 700 ppm of alcohols, 250 ppm of terpenes directly on-line and validated the data off-line by GC-MS. The EN gave also direct insight into the differences between the two composting batch types. During grass composting larger amounts of alcohols are emitted whereas relative content of terpenes is twice as high for pine composting.\n",
            " Anaerobic digestion is a biological process in which the organic matter is converted by specific microorganisms into biogas (mainly CH 4 and CO 2 ) that can be used for electricity generation. At the beginning of the process the matter is decomposed to mono-and oligomers (amino acids, long-chain fatty acids and saccharides), then the fermentation of the volatile fatty acids appears (mainly acetic acid), followed by gases (H 2 , CO 2 ) and finally CH 4 production. The parameters affecting the status of anaerobic digestion are mainly associated with changes in plant feeding and environmental fluctuations, i.e., temperature [180] . The demand for online monitoring and control of biogas process is increasing, since it can improve process plants stability and economy.\n",
            " The concentration of some compounds in the gas phase changes when the organic overload (ORL) appears in the reactor. The ORL leads to process disturbance and thus, influences the effectiveness of methane production. Adam et al. [181] developed an EN composed of six commercial MOS gas sensors for early detection of organic overload in the reactor. The e-nose was set to detect CH 4 , H 2 S, H 2 , alcohols, alkanes, alkenes and ketones. Hotelling's T 2 value and an upper control limit using stable digesters as a reference set were used as indirect state variable for early detection of process disturbance caused by organic overload. The EN could detect organic load variations and it was also able to monitor process disturbances and recovery periods. Moreover, in some cases the e-nose technology appeared to be more efficient than the monitoring of methane content in the biogas or pH measurements of the liquid phase. Furthermore, Adam et al. [182] investigated the use of the above mentioned EN for online anaerobic reactor state monitoring at the pilot-scale and then at the full scale level. At the pilot-scale level, the e-nose observations present a good agreement with the reactor state. At the full-scale level, the device provided warnings of the major disturbances in the reactor but two slight disturbances were not detected and it gave one major false alarm. This work showed that gas phase relation with anaerobic process should be deeper investigated, as an EN could indicate the reactor state, focusing on the gas phase. Similar conclusions can be drown from Costa et al. [183] Orzi et al. [184] investigate the correlation between microbial activity (i.e., biological stability measured by aerobic OD 20 test and ABP anaerobic tests) and odor emissions from municipal solid waste during anaerobic digestion in a full-scale treatment plant considering the three stages of the process (input, digested and post-digested waste). Authors used complementary approaches for the measurement of odor impact (olfactometry) and characterization of the different groups of VOCs responsible for that odor (GC-MS and PEN2 e-nose from Airsense). As expected the odor reduction due to the acquirement of biological stability was accompanied by a change in the organic molecules composing the gaseous phase in the studied wastes. Moreover, principal component and partial least squares analyses applied to the EN and GC-MS data sets gave good regression for the OD 20 vs. the EN and OD 20 vs. the GC-MS data. Therefore, OD 20 reduction could be used as an odour depletion indicator. Presented above applications are summarized in Table 7 . \n",
            " Electronic noses can be trained to determine odor concentrations (ou/m 3 ) or discriminate odor sources. Romain et al. [185] used a home-made EN made of 7 Figaro MOS sensors for the monitoring of odor concentration inside a compost hall. Measurements were validated with dynamic olfactometry. Authors suggested that measurements with EN at odor source can be applied together with dispersion models in order to asses the odor impact in the vicinity of the facility. The same authors [186] studied also the influence of sensor drift in time on the odor source discrimination capability of an e-nose composed of 12 Figaro MOS sensors. Authors reported that classification accuracy decreased from 98% at the beginning of the tests to only 20% after three years. Authors suggested to solve this problem by additional training sessions during the monitoring period. Another approach proposed by Capelli et al. [187] requires an internal calibration system that allows to estimate the sensor drift daily and to compensate it with suitable algorithms.\n",
            " Discrimination of odor sources was also performed by Sironi et al. [188] who applied two EN developed earlier in their laboratory [189] . First one was installed at the composting plant territory and second one inside a house situated 300 m from the facility. During a 4 days trial the e-nose placed inside the house detected the presence of odors coming from the composting plant for about 7.8% of the total monitoring duration. The results were compared with odor complaints from inhabitants, obtaining a correspondence of 72%. Moreover, 86% of detected odorous events corresponded to the open air storage of the waste screening overflows heaps, which was therefore identified as the major odor source of the investigated composting plant. Later on, the same authors investigated again the site but the monitoring time was increased from few days to few weeks [190] . The purpose of this work was to evaluate which features had to be extracted from the sensor responses curves in order to optimize the correlation between odor classification performed by an EN and odor reports from inhabitants. During this study, the variability of humidity content in analyzed air turned out to be a critical factor in the use of EN for environmental air monitoring. The problem was solved later one [189] . Indeed, electronic nose was equipped with a specific humidity regulator that allows the instrument to be used in the field under variable meteorological conditions. Improved e-noses were installed at several locations (waste treatment plants, oil mill and in the surrounding urban area) and demonstrated odor sources classification accuracy of 88%. In the same time, older version of the e-nose correctly classified 82% of measurements during a 10 days trial. Authors described also an experimental procedure for the definition of minimum performance requirements for environmental odor monitoring, which is a first step towards standardization of the specific case of electronic nose application for environmental odor monitoring [191] .\n",
            " Indeed, the use of EN in the field is very challenging, especially in variable weather conditions. Nicolas et al. [33] placed a network of 5 e-noses comprising each 6 metal oxide sensors (Figaro) in the close surroundings of a compost facility in Belgium. The EN was trained to estimate odor concentration (ou/m 3 ) and classify odor sources into five possible categories odor-free atmosphere, engine exhaust gases, green compost, bio-drying or fresh waste emissions. Moreover, according to the wind direction, the responses of e-noses placed in the right wind sector were used to assess the maximum downwind distance of odor perception. A simple validation test was carried on by comparing the detection of odor events by the network and the subjective feeling of field observers placed near the electronic noses. About each event detected by the network was validated by field observer. Then residents in the neighboring villages were appealed to regularly provide their estimation of the odor annoyance, according to a procedure described by Nicolas et al. [192] . In 17 cases out of 21, the network detected an odor event when residents identified an odor coming from the waste treatment plant. For 10 cases among these 17, the resident concerned was included in the perception zone predicted by the e-nose network. The 7 remaining cases corresponded to unstable atmospheric conditions. Authors concluded that a network comprised of a higher number of e-noses could compensate for the variable weather conditions. An interesting work was described by Giungato et al. [165] who tested two commercially available sensors (PEN3 and Cyranose320) for odor source discrimination capabilities. Three types of odors were investigated: biogas, a by-product of mechanical treatment of municipal solid wastes, and a sludge pressed and dehydrated from treatment of urban wastewater. The MOS based e-nose was able to discriminate successfully 86.7% of samples, whereas the CPs only 53.3%. Surprisingly, the best results were achieved by choosing 4 MOS and 2 CPs sensors (93.3%). This work highlights how important is the selection of the adequate type and number of sensors used for a given application. Taking into account that described above investigations were performed using mainly MOS sensors (usually from Figaro), it is safe to say that at least in the field of odorous mixtures investigation in the vicinity of waste management plants there is still a lot of possibilities in terms of appropriate sensors selections.\n",
            " The discriminatory possibilities of two types of EN in the distinction and classification of odorous samples collected around a municipal landfill was studied by Gębicki et al. [36, 130] . One of the tested e-noses was the Heracles Neo from Alpha M.O.S based on ultra-fast gas chromatography technology. The second device was a home-made e-nose composed of MOS, PID and electrochemical sensors. Additionally, field olfactometry investigations were performed at places where samples were collected for analyses using both types of electronic noses. A correctness of classification of 94.8% and 84.4% was achieved for Heracles Neo and home made e-nose, respectively. These results corresponded to samples collected during spring period and thus, characterized by high odor nuisance. For lower odor concentrations observed in winter, the correctness of classification dropped to 87.5% and 71.9%, respectively. Authors concluded that comparing the price of both e-noses the home-made one exhibits a satisfactory level of correct results as compared to much more expensive Heracles Neo. As suggested by the same authors [193] the performance of e-nose based on gas sensors can be improved by implementation of more and more sensitive sensing arrays. Presented above applications are summarized in Table 8 . Table 8 . Examples of sensorial e-noses applications in the waste management plants.\n",

            " Electronic noses are promising tools for the control of waste treatment process and odor impact assessment in the waste management plants. Multiple examples presented in this review have shown that once adequately trained, EN can be used successfully for quantitative and qualitative measurement of odorants in the analyzed samples as well as for odor concentration measurements and odor sources discrimination. Comparing to other methods, analysis with electronic noses allows the measurements to be run continuously. However, EN should not be treated as competitive method for the well established sensory and analytical techniques. Indeed, current trends clearly stands that maximum information on the odorous samples investigations is achieved when olfactometry, GC-MS and e-noses are used as complementary approaches to a given problem.\n",
            " Bibliography presented in this review discusses also some critical aspects connected with the development of the EN devices. Concerning the sensors, several studies have highlighted the problem of stability towards temperature and humidity variations, as well as sensor response drift over time. Possible solutions to these problems using appropriate data processing methods were presented in this paper showing that the EN devices require time-consuming calibrations and re-calibrations and/or sophisticated and complex technology in order to produce accurate and reliable results. Despite these problems a few commercial e-noses dedicated for the environmental monitoring exists. However, mainly due to the problems associated with sensors stability the warranty provided by their manufacturers is usually very short (i.e., 12 months) and given the price of these devices-not satisfactory. The malfunctioning sensor in most cases can not be replaced by a new one due to the poor reproducibility of the gas sensors' manufacturing.\n",
            " Actually, there are several trends in order to improve sensing performances of existing EN, including development of new gas sensors. Although nanotechnology can provide a solution to the sensitivity issues, the long term stability of gas sensors based on nanoparticles is still an issue.\n",
            " Future trends regarding the use of EN in the environmental analyses shall not only focus on the development of new sensors or data processing methods, but also concentrate on better adjustment of these instruments for outdoor conditions, especially for long-term monitoring applications and adaptations on mobile platforms and on portable devices. Indeed, the possibility of drone assisted measurements using EN are currently intensively examined [194] .\n",
            " Another important issue limiting the use of EN for environmental applications is the lack of specific regulation for their standardization. EN are relatively complex instruments, and their development give rise to a number of degrees of freedom, regarding mainly the choice of gas sensors, the training and data processing methodology. Therefore, the standardization of the EN devices and procedures for their correct utilization is a necessary step for their diffusion. \n",

            "Title: African perspectives: modern complexities of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic zoonoses\n",
            "Body Text: R ecent events have shown that public health, animal health and national economies have been threatened, globally, by the increased occurrence of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (ErEIDs) [1] . Specifically, land use change cum agricultural practices, surging human demographic, pathogen evolution (antimicrobial resistance), failure of public health systems, global travel and more global interconnectedness in spatial and temporal dimensions have driven these threats [2] . Other aggravating factors include: ecological changes, incursion into previously uninhabited areas, changes in human behavior, environmental degradation, international trade, technology and industry, antimicrobial misuse, and deficiencies in public health infrastructure and decision-making [1] [2] [3] . Major ErEIDs − including zoonoses − have been reported in the last two decades including: Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, Hendra, Nipah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1, H5N8 and H7N9 subtypes, West Nile fever, Pandemic H1N1 Influenza, Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Many of these diseases have been documented in Africa.\n",
            " In Africa, 47 of the 54 countries (87%) have reported ErEIDs to the WHO since 1997 ( Table 1) . While several initiatives have been implemented globally to accelerate progress toward a safer world [4] , it is yet not clear whether African countries are ready and capable of handling the magnitude and threats associated with ErEIDs [4] . Here, we reviewed plausible reasons and drivers for the upsurge of ErEIDs in Africa and proffer some mitigating measures.\n",
            " Human populations in African countries have rapidly increased in the last few decades (Figure 1 ). Population growth has occurred together with a substantial modification of human and pathogen behaviours [2, 4] . For example, Hoosegood has identified that societal behaviours eg, union formation and cohabitation, re-marriage and partnering, union instability-widowhood, divorce and separation, fertility and fecundity, and fertility-related decisions significantly impact on and are impacted by HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan regions particularly, in Southern Africa [5] . Second, urban growth has disrupted wildlife and pathogen ecology [1, 2] . As human-pathogen contacts increase, so does the probability for more outbreaks. Pathogens affected include cowpox, Lyme disease, Nipah, Hendra and Ebola viruses as well as the group named ESKAPE -which includes Enterococci, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and En-terobacteria-which explains between 45 and 77% of all African human mortalities [1, 3] . As human-pathogen contacts increase, so does the probability of more outbreaks.\n",
            " To prevent epidemics, it is needed to markedly improve public infrastructures, sanitation, and the health systems. For instance, the public and animal health surveillance systems must transform, so interventions occur within acceptable response times [1, 3, 4] .\n",
            " Third, in the 20 th century, the average temperature has increased approximately 0.7°C in the African continent. Climate change has predisposed Africa to highly vulnerable situations, particularly around internationally shared water resources. Consequently, new challenges have emerged, including: border-related conflicts, food security risk due to declines agricultural production, vectorand water-borne diseases, (especially in areas with inadequate health infrastructure), flooding and exacerbation of desertification by changes in rainfall and intensified land use [2] . Predictions related to water resources include: (a) decreased rainfalls in portions of the Sahel, (b) increased rainfalls in east central Africa, (c) increased temperature ranging from 0.2°C to >0.5°C per decade, especially in the semi-arid margins of the Sahara and central southern Africa [6] . Some studies have also suggested that major climate change will influence water resource use, natural resources management and biodiversity, human health, food security, resettlement and infrastructure re-allocation, and desertification [2, 6] . Variance in climatic conditions will impact significantly on disease ecology and epidemiology with upsurge in human-animal disease conditions due decreased salinity of the soil which can increase the number of toxic bacteria and breeding sites for mosquitoes and rodents.\n",
            " These challenges can have consequences on international trade and commerce. Since the liberalization of trade policies between countries over the past two decades, national economies have grown in leaps and bounds. While such policies have fast-tracked growth forecast for African countries, they also have augmented the risks of emergent and trans-boundary animal and human diseases especially associated with long flights, such zoonotic tuberculosis, influenza viruses, HIV/AIDS and cholera. Because trans-border movements of livestock and/or some commercial practices may bring together disease vectors and humans, human and animal health should be addressed together [1] [2] [3] .\n",
            " Fourthly, the rapid expansion in human populations (and consequently, the need to meet the food security needs) has warranted the intensification of animal and crop agriculture. These changes have converted previously fallow lands and forest into arable, agricultural and/or grazing lands. Associated with these changes are increased (a) rodents populations, (b) dispersal and redistributions of wild ruminants populations and their ectoparasites, (c) wildlife-livestock-human interactions, and (d) occurrence of diseases like Rift Valley Fever. Bodies of evidence have suggested that the rate of future zoonotic diseases will be closely linked to the evolution of the agriculture-environment nexus [1, 2] . It is suggested that, as long as Africa (or any other continent) does not address complex interactions -such as those that involve agriculture, the environment, economics, sociology, as well as zoonotic pathogens, disease outbreaks may follow human-driven disruptions, as those observed after major changes in land use, eg, those related with the construction of dams, mines, and intensive agriculture.\n",
            " The fact that pathogens have evolved and keep evolving should be emphasized. Microbes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have developed multiple resistance mechanisms due to excessive and long-term use of antimicrobials, genetic transfers of resistance genes and selective pressures [2, 3] . Endemic antimicrobial-resistant Africa will need to prioritize rapid detection, prompt response to ErEIDs, optimize the benefit of geospatial epidemiology in policy decisions and utilize interdisciplinary educational programs. ) . Intense human-animal interactions, and consumption of non-certified pathogen-free animal products facilitate the spread of zoonoses pathogens come with heavy clinical and economic burdens, especially in the developing countries. Recent review had indicated that endemic infections associated with antimicrobial resistance requires a particular attention because such diseases are linked with approximately 44 to 77% of all annual human deaths in Africa [3] . It has been estimated that, by 2050, more lives will be lost due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) than cancer [3] . One major component of antimicrobial resistance is the overuse of antimicrobials in the production of livestock, which are then passed to humans [3] . Because vaccines reduce the incidence of infectious diseases (and, therefore, antibiotic use), immunisations might reduce AMR [1, 3, 7] .\n",
            " Prevention and mitigations: given the numerous and serious issues here identified, African governments need to prioritize efforts aimed at rapid detection and prompt response to emerging or re-emerging pathogens. For example, the Critical Response Time (CRT or time available to implement effective epidemic control measures) should be considered in decision-making [1, 5] . That is so because for any intervention to be very effective (≈ 100%), it must be deployed under a realist timeframe; if it requires a longer period of time, it will necessarily be (i) less effective (if not ineffective), and (ii) more expensive [5] . CRT may or may not include geo-referenced data. When it lacks geographical data, it becomes much shorter, making useless almost any intervention. Thus, the real significance of CRT is that it should be expanded (giving decision-makers more time to complete interventions) − which can only be achieved when high-resolution geo-referenced epidemiologic data are analyzed in time and space. Thus, to achieve improved epidemic control measures, geographically explicit data should be collected from epidemics, analysed and lessons learnt made available for future interventions. Only such (local or regional) data can support scientifically valid decision-making. Yet, even recent epidemics have been addressed with ad hoc policies, such as the classic '3-km radius control rings' -which assume all epidemics (ie, all pathogens, all host species, and all local geographies) are identical [1] [2] [3] . Failure to consider local bio-geo-epidemiological information has led to widespread dissemination of major epidemics, such as Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone [8] .\n",
            " Infectious diseases and zoonoses are extremely expensive to nations both clinically and economically, for example a recent valuation had estimated such costs to include: SARS in Asia and Canada (US$ 30-50 billion), HPAI H5N1 globally (US$ 30 billion), worldwide influenza H1N1 (US$ 45-55 billion), Ebola in West Africa (US$ 10 billion) and Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean (US$ 7-18 billion) [9] , promptly delivered pre-emptive actions and control measures, as well as targeted interventions can significantly reduce burdens associated with these diseases.\n",
            " The creation of interdisciplinary educational programs aimed at local and regional decision-makers involved in disease diagnosis, dissemination, and control, is recommended. Such programs could develop and integrate: (i) local data on antimicrobial resistance, (ii) high-resolution, local geo-referenced data, and (iii) site-specific control measures that can be implemented within biologically valid critical response times.\n",

            "Body Text: We all live, suff er, and prosper in a world of bacteria and viruses. The damage caused by bacteria as infectious agents-ie, invaders of host tissues and disease-causing organisms-is well accepted. Bacteria can trigger various diseases, many of which aff ect the respiratory tract. During the prenatal period and early childhood, bacterial infections can aff ect intrauterine lung development during important developmental time windows. 1 Bacteria not only cause infections that elicit adaptive immune responses, but also populate habitats in our body in large numbers, outnumbering human cells about ten-fold. Besides metabolic functions, the microbiome-ie, the collective genomes of microbes living inside and on the human body-has a major eff ect on the development of immune responses early in life. Mice raised under germ-free conditions show several defi ciencies in immune responses and are prone to the development of experimental asthma. 2 Reconstitution of the gut microbiome of germ-free mice with microbiota from mice raised in specifi c pathogen-free conditions corrects these defi cits, but only when administered early in life. 2 The role of the lung microbiome in turn is less well known. Several studies [3] [4] [5] [6] have reported specifi c colonisation with proteobacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and sputum of patients with asthma. But whether this type of colonisation precedes the onset of asthma or occurs secondary to airway infl ammation remains to be elucidated. Viruses are generally known as causes of disease and have been associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). 7, 8 Numerous studies 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] have linked early viral LRTIs to the development of childhood wheeze and asthma. The nature of this association is, however, not completely clear. Viruses might predispose to the onset of wheeze and asthma, but it is equally conceivable that viral infections merely unmask host factors underlying disease susceptibility. Alternatively, both notions might be justifi ed: viruses might trigger wheeze and asthma and thereby aggravate airway infl ammation. 15, 18 The role of the bacterial microbiome in shaping immune responses to virus infections is currently unknown.\n",
            " In this Review, we fi rst discuss the controversial role of viruses in the development of childhood asthma. We then review the role of the bacterial microbiome and bacterial infections. Finally, we discuss the potential eff ect of viral and bacterial infections on the treatment and prevention of childhood asthma.\n",
            " The most commonly identifi ed viruses causing respiratory tract infections in children are human rhinoviruses (HRVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), infl uenza and parainfl uenza viruses, coronavirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and bocavirus. 7, 8, 22 HRVs (family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus) are single-stranded, non-enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses with more than 100 diff erent serotypes. Serotypes are subdivided by their receptor (major group: small intercellular adhesion molecule, minor group: low density lipoprotein receptor) and according to sequence variations-ie, HRV-A or HRV-B and lately also the potentially more virulent HRV-C. 7, 25 HRVs were initially thought to be limited to URTIs. 24 However, HRVs are able to spread to and replicate in the lower airways, [26] [27] [28] and thus might lead to LRTIs. 7, 24, 29, 30 RSV (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Pneumovirus) is a single-stranded, enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus that Review is classifi ed into two subtypes, RSV-A and RSV-B. In most patients, RSV produces only mild symptoms of URTI, but in infants RSV can lead to bronchiolitis with season of birth as an important predictor of severe disease, especially in immunocompromised and premature infants. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] By use of PCR-based viral diagnostics, viruses and multiple coexisting viral strains have been detected in biological samples not only from patients with respiratory tract infections, but also from asymptomatic individuals. Several HRV strains have been shown to circulate during one infectious season 36 and HRV RNA was identifi ed in nasal mucus as a remnant of previous infection long after individuals had become symptom-free. 7, 8, 31, 37 Viruses predispose to asthma Abundant epidemiological data have reported an association between respiratory viral infections and the development of childhood wheeze and asthma. Several prospective studies and a few studies of population-based cohorts have investigated children admitted to hospital for symptomatic LRTIs (table) . 10, 17, 29, 30, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] Several of these studies 30,38-45 undertook analyses of both HRVs and RSV. In the longitudinal Tucson Children's Respiratory Study, 10 viral LRTI during the fi rst 3 years of life was an independent determinant of wheeze at age 6 years (table) . This risk decreased until age 11-13 years and was accompanied by a reduction in forced expiratory volume during 1 s and increased responsiveness to salbutamol, implying a lasting change in the regulation of airway smooth muscle tone. 10 Finnish studies 38, 41 replicated this fi nding and showed that the risk of asthma conferred by virus-induced LRTI might decrease over time (table) . Another important population-based birth-cohort, the Tennessee Asthma Bronchiolitis Study (TABS), 33 investigated children that were admitted to hospital or visited outpatient and emergency departments with symptoms of bronchiolitis secondary to viral LRTI. Although the risk of asthma was generally increased after viral LRTI during infancy, this risk was also dependent on the age of the child at the peak of the virus season with a maximum risk for those infants aged around 121 days. 33 Furthermore, the risk diff ered between winter months, probably dominated by RSV infections, and non-winter months, probably dominated by HRV infections (table) . 46, 47 In support of these fi ndings, a further study 48 extended the population of the TABS cohort and added a further Californian population; investigators reported that about 13% of childhood asthma cases were attributable to infant LRTIs during the RSV season.\n",
            " RSV infection early in life might not only be associated with long-term eff ects on lung function and changed airway tone, but might also relate to allergic disease. 34, 35, [49] [50] [51] Sigurs and coworkers 35, 50, 51 undertook observational studies of infants admitted to hospital in Sweden for severe RSV-induced LRTI and reported that RSV-induced LRTI was linked to atopic sensitisation and allergic disease at 7 years of age. This increased risk of atopic sensitisation and allergic disease persisted up to age 13 years, when RSV-induced LRTI during infancy was also associated with allergic asthma. 35 However, these fi ndings are restricted to individuals with severe disease requiring admission to hospital. Further reviews 34, 52, 53 have discussed the potential role of RSV bronchiolitis in the initiation of asthma.\n",
            " The possible causal role of viral infections can only be established by intervention trials that attempt to prevent viral infection and thereby prevent subsequent wheeze and asthma. Passive immunisation with antibodies against RSV has been investigated. Simões and coworkers 54,55 undertook prospective, multicentre, matched double cohort studies in children born prematurely, and showed that the administration of palivizumab-a humanised antibody against the RSV fusion protein 56 -was associated with a signifi cant decrease in relative risk of recurrent wheeze as diagnosed by a doctor at 2-5 years of age, but only in children without a family history of asthma or atopy. 54 The keenly anticipated results of the MAKI trial, 57 a more robust multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial of palivizumab in 429 healthy preterm babies, showed that the number of cumulative wheezing days during the fi rst year of life was signifi cantly (p<0·001) lower after palivizumab prophylaxis. Moreover, signifi cant reductions in the number of RSV infections and hospital admissions for RSV were reported in the palivizumab treatment group compared with the placebo group (table). 57\n",
            " Rather than causing asthma, viral LRTI might merely unveil the underlying risk. In other words, infection might trigger symptoms in individuals with pre-existing host factors who would have become symptomatic anyway. These host factors include altered airway function or mechanics, genetic background, atopic sensitisation, and impaired mucosal and systemic immune responses. Environmental exposures might additionally aff ect the probability that a patient with asthma exacerbates with viral infections.\n",
            " Wheeze is a symptom of expiratory fl ow limitation as a function of airway calibre and airway mechanics, 58 which results in fl uttering of the airway walls and a whistling sound. After oedema, bronchospasm, or other changes in airway mechanics due to LRTI-induced infl ammation, any narrowing of the airway can result in wheeze, especially in infants. Decreased airway function and bronchial hyper-responsiveness is not only present with acute wheeze, but might also precede its onset. 59 \n",
            " development in early time windows might adversely aff ect the anatomy or wall mechanics of the airway, which might then be unmasked by infection with respiratory viruses leading to the fi rst manifestation of wheeze. 58,61\n",
            " A prominent host factor is the genetic background of the child, which can directly aff ect lung growth and development or induce changes in immune responses. 62 Historically, linkage studies, analyses by positional cloning, and candidate gene studies have identifi ed many genetic variants associated with asthma. 62, 63 Since high-throughput techniques have become less expensive, 33 genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of asthma have been reported until August 16, 2013. The fi rst GWAS of asthma described the GSDMB-ORMDL3 locus on chromosome 17q21, which has been replicated in many populations and has the greatest eff ect on childhood-onset asthma. [64] [65] [66] Notably, Smit and coworkers 67 did an association analysis in children from the Epidemiological Study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA) and showed that neither the eff ect of 17q21 risk alleles nor of early LRTI on asthma are independent of each other. Odds ratios (ORs) for early-onset asthma after early LRTI were higher for carriers of risk alleles (3·42-6·36) than for non-carriers (1·84-2·44, p interaction 0·008-0·05). 67 These fi ndings suggest that early RTIs uncover carriers of risk and enhance detrimental viral eff ects. Çalişkan and coworkers 68 confi rmed this notion by investigation of children from the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study, and replicated the fi ndings in individuals from the Copenhagen Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC), both high-risk cohorts. The investigators showed that 17q21 variants increased the risk of asthma and that HRV-induced LRTI modifi ed this risk in both cohorts. ORs for asthma in homozygous risk allele carriers of rs7216389 were 26·1 in the COAST study (3·9 in COPSAC) if the children had at least one HRVinduced LRTI compared with 0·8 (0·7 in COPSAC) if there was no previous HRV-LRTI (p interaction ≤0·01 vs 0·08 in COPSAC). 68 Thomsen and coworkers 49 did a retrospective analysis of data from the large Danish twin registry and used advanced genetic variance components models and direction of causation models to show that RSV infection was an indicator of genetic predisposition to asthma, but does not seem to cause asthma (table) .\n",
            " Another important host factor is atopic sensitisation. Atopy and allergic disease are independently associated with subsequent asthma. 61 The association between early and persistent sensitisation and asthma lasts through early childhood and into adulthood. 22, 61 Sensitisation to inhalant allergens during childhood is associated with decreased lung growth, which is an independent risk factor for asthma later in life. 22, 61 Studies of two Australian birth cohorts, the populationbased Raine Study and the high-risk Childhood Asthma Study (CAS), 30, 42, 43, 69, 70 investigated the potential role of atopic sensitisation in the complex interplay with viral infections. In the Raine Study, 69 sensitisation at age 6 years was associated with an increased risk of current asthma, but this risk was higher if study participants had LRTI during the fi rst year of life. In the CAS, Kusel and coworkers 42 reported that the risk of both current asthma at 5 years (diagnosed by a doctor) and persistent wheeze (which started before age 3 years and persisted until age 5 years) was increased after HRV-induced LRTI compared to outcome without exposure, whereas after RSV-induced LRTI, the risk was only increased for wheeze (table) . This increased risk was, however, restricted to children sensitised by age 2 years. 42 Results from follow-up at age 10 years showed similar trends. 43 Children with virus-induced, particularly febrile, LRTIs were at increased risk of asthma and wheeze, which was pronounced if the children were sensitised by age 2 years (table) . 43 In the COAST study (table), the risk of wheeze at age 3 years and 6 years was increased after either HRV-induced or RSV-induced LRTI during the fi rst 3 years of life. 40, 44 Early sensitisation was a predisposing factor in the time course of events preceding the development of wheeze. 39\n",
            " Hansel and coworkers 71 have reviewed the role of mucosal immune responses to microorganisms in the development of asthma. Thus, we will only focus on aspects of impaired immune responses to viral infections that predispose to asthma. During infancy, the immune system, including both the innate and adaptive immune responses, is immature compared with the immunity attained as an adult. Some evidence suggests that infants who develop atopy and asthma have a particularly delayed maturation of immune responses, which might predispose to development of viral LRTIs and result in asthma. 15, [21] [22] [23] [24] 70, 72 During infancy, dendritic cells are less capable of presenting antigen compared with later in childhood. 23 T cells, as part of the adaptive defence alliance, are less able to produce cytokines and form memory cells after birth, and instead might even undergo apoptosis upon antigen contact. 72 Moreover, adaptive immune responses of neonates show an inherent T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) bias, with maturation of the T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) responses lagging; 72,73 this bias is more pronounced in individuals with an atopic predisposition. 72 This results in a less ordered Th1 response and decreased interferon-γ concentration on contact with pathogens. 74 The combination of ineffi cacious immune response towards viral pathogens and a delay in the development of more focused and eff ective responses is related to an increased number of RTIs early in life, possibly because of increased viral spread to the lower airways. 21 \n",
            " The airway epithelium is regarded as the fi rst line of defence against respiratory viruses; its role is complex 77 and it plays a central part in mucosal immunity. 71 Although viruses have been shown to disrupt the integrity of the respiratory mucosa, such disruptions are also a component of the asthmatic phenotype. Epithelial integrity in children with asthma has been related to genetic risk as conferred by polymorphisms in SPINK5, a gene encoding a serine proteinase inhibitor known to be involved in the retention of epithelial barrier function. 78\n",
            " The most robust and consistent fi nding conferring preexistent risk of LRTIs and wheeze is related to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure either prenatally or postnatally. ETS has been shown to aff ect early lung function by disrupting growth and development of the lungs during important time windows of rapid growth. 79 Moreover, a link between early ETS exposure, virus-induced LRTI, and later wheeze and asthma has been shown. 38, 40, 41, 80, 81 This association could be attributable to the eff ect of ETS on the maturing innate immune response, which could account for increased susceptibility to infections in infants exposed to ETS. 82, 83 Studies in mice showed that ETS alters antiviral immune responses thereby mitigating viral infections. 84 The genetic background of a child might furthermore modify the association between an adverse environmental exposure and premorbid risk of asthma. In Smit and coworkers' 67 analysis of children from the EGEA study, ETS exposure further enhanced the eff ects of early viral LRTIs on 17q21 risk allele carriers. As a result, children with a history of ETS exposure and a specifi c genetic background could be especially susceptible to viral infection.\n",
            " In addition to ETS, exposure to outdoor air pollution could play an important part not only as a trigger of asthma exacerbations, but also as an inducer of alterations in airway function or mechanics, and in immune response, leading to asthma. Studies 85 have investigated the density of car traffi c, in particular truck traffi c on roads in close proximity to the child's residence, and identifi ed that such exposure could have direct eff ects on lung growth, 86 and might also lead to changes in immune function, because exposure to air pollution is directly associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections during infancy. 87 Another important environmental exposure relates to maternal and infant nutrition. Malnutrition might directly aff ect the respiratory system by aff ecting growth and development. Children of mothers exposed to the Dutch famine during early and mid-gestation were shown to be at risk of obstructive airway disease, suggesting direct nutritional eff ects on lung development and postnatal airway mechanics. 88 Maternal dietary vitamin D and vitamin E concentrations during pregnancy were inversely related to wheeze in children. 89 Whereas vitamin E has been shown to interfere with airway development via epigenetic changes, 90 low serum vitamin D concentrations have been related to respiratory infections in infants. 91 Although the exact role of vitamin D in the context of immune modulation is not yet clear, it could be important for regulation of both innate and adaptive immune response. 92\n",
            " The human body harbours tens of trillions of bacteria, far more than the number of human cells. Individuals have great variation in the bacterial species at diff erent body sites and mucosal surfaces. 93 Interindividual diversity is much greater than the variation in composition of these microbiota in the individual over time. 94 The gut microbiome has mainly been studied in mice and humans. The Human Microbiome Project 95 has extensively characterised faecal samples from healthy individuals. Unfortunately, the airway microbiome has not been included in this ground-breaking project and therefore characterisation of airway samples in healthy populations is scarce. Unlike the gastrointestinal tract, from which faecal samples can easily be obtained, accessibility of the airways, particularly in children, restricts the feasibility of such studies. Technical issues such as the comparability of microbiome analyses from the upper and lower respiratory tract and the potential contamination of bronchoscopic samples have not been resolved.\n",
            " Nevertheless, some conclusions can be made. Children and adults with asthma seem to be primarily colonised with gammaproteobacteria-ie, Haemophilus infl uenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. [3] [4] [5] [6] 96 However, in individuals with asthma, whether this pattern of colonisation occurs secondary to airway epithelium damage, impaired barrier function, and infl ammatory changes in the airways 21, 23, 97 or is a primary cause of the disease remains to be elucidated. One birth cohort study 3 suggests that colonisation of the hypopharynx with H infl uenzae, M catarrhalis, and S pneumoniae very early in life precedes the onset of asthma. Notably, this risk associated with colonisation at 1 month of age was independent of colonisation at later timepoints, suggesting a potential window of opportunity for disease development. 3 However, because these fi ndings were from children of mothers who had asthma, generalisation of the results is limited. Moreover, the investigators used conventional culture methods; 3 studies that use DNA-based techniques are needed because they might identify an increased variety of microbiota. Furthermore, whether these fi ndings truly refl ect colonisation of the lower airway mucosa remains unclear because these studies used either bronchoalveolar lavage samples, sputum samples, or samples from the hypopharynx. Although bacteria might colonise mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract and fl uid and Review sputum in the lower airways, true colonisation of mucosal surfaces in the lower respiratory tract remains a matter of debate.\n",
            " The role of the abundant gut microbiome in respiratory diseases furthermore awaits elucidation. In experimental studies, 2 reconstitution of a normal faecal microbiome early in life in gnotobiotic mice abolishes the risk of asthma associated with germ-free upbringing. Whether the gut-lung axis is of equal importance in humans, particularly in those prone to develop asthma, has been indirectly investigated in a few studies. 98, 99 The microbiome of the gut of an infant could be aff ected by the mode of birth delivery, because children born by caesarean section are colonised diff erently than children who were vaginally delivered. 98 Vaginal fl ora could aff ect the gut colonisation of an infant and aff ect the infant's risk of asthma. Benn and coworkers 99 did a populationbased cohort study in Denmark, and showed that the composition of the maternal vaginal microfl ora aff ected wheeze of their off spring during the fi rst 3 years of life, and aff ected risk of asthma in children aged 4-5 years. Whereas Ureaplasma urealyticum was associated with infant wheeze only (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·0), Staphylococcus aureus (adjusted OR 2·2) and maternal antibiotic use during pregnancy (adjusted OR 1·7) were associated with asthma in the child at 5 years of age as defi ned by use of asthma-specifi c medication. 99 However, the data for U urealyticum were unaff ected by adjustment for antibiotic treatment. Moreover, U urealyticum has been shown to invade the amniotic sac, where it can reproduce. 99 Keski-Nisula and coworkers 100 reported that intrauterine growth of potential pathogenic bacteria such as Bacteroides spp, Clostridium spp, and Streptococcus spp were associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma at age 15-17 years.\n",
            " Distortion of the microbiome could occur after administration of antibiotics. Maternal antibiotic use could therefore aff ect a child's risk of asthma by changing the vaginal and gut microbiome of the mother. 101 Moreover, most antibiotics cross the placenta and might therefore aff ect the fetal and postnatal microbiota of the child. In a cross-sectional case-control study 102 of 338 children with asthma and 467 controls, aged 6-7 years, Calvani and coworkers identifi ed that episodes of maternal fever as a proxy measure of infection were associated with childhood asthma independently of maternal asthma. After adjustment for maternal antibiotic use, the results were not signifi cant suggesting a primary role for antibiotics. Other studies [103] [104] [105] have supported these fi ndings. The role of administration of antibiotics to the child compared with the mother is prone to bias in epidemiological studies. Many children are given antibiotics because of respiratory trouble; confounding by indication severely limits the validity of these studies. In fact, when only considering children receiving antibiotics for other non-respiratory indications, the positive associations disappear. 106, 107 In environments rich in microbials, such as traditional European farms, exposure is associated with protection from atopic sensitisation, hay fever, and childhood wheeze and asthma. [108] [109] [110] [111] The abundant and diverse microbial burden within these environments has an important protective role in childhood asthma, 109 in which the timepoint of exposure can be crucial. 111 However, bacterial exposure in urban environments has also been shown to be inversely related to atopy and asthma. 112 Whether these environmental exposures aff ect the human airway and gut microbiome is still unknown. In mice, the biogeography of their habitat was shown to shape the diversity of their intestinal microbiota. 113 Additionally, environmental microbial exposure might directly aff ect immune responses. 21, 23 In the cord blood of infants born to mothers exposed to farming activity and farm dairy products during pregnancy, interferon-γ and TNF-α concentrations were higher compared with infants born to mothers who did not have any farm contact, 114 suggesting a strengthening of antiviral responses early in life. Moreover, innate immune receptors such as CD14, TLR2, and TLR4 were persistently upregulated in children who grew up on farms. 111, 115 Adaptive immunity was also aff ected; CD4+CD25hiTreg cells were both more abundant and more capable of suppressing T-cell proliferation in the cord blood of newborn babies with farming mothers than babies of non-farming mothers. 116 Furthermore, allergen-induced Th2-associated production of cytokines, such as interleukin 4 and interleukin 13, and immunoglobulins and their isotypes, such as IgG1, IgG4, and IgE inhibition of Ig-class switching, seems to be reduced in farm environments. 111\n",
            " Bacterial infections are regarded as a distorted equilibrium of microbial communities, which gives rise to the overgrowth of one species. The association between maternal infections (urinary tract infections and chorioamnionitis) during pregnancy and subsequent wheeze and asthma in children has been assessed through data from questionnaires and medical records and registers. [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] Kumar and coworkers 120 further investigated chorioamnionitis by assessment of objective histological changes. Results from these studies suggest a potential role of prenatal bacterial infections in the initiation of wheeze and asthma in children.\n",
            " Postnatal childhood infection with atypical bacteria, such as chlamydia and mycoplasma, have also been related to increased risk of development of asthma. 96 However, similar to virus infections, several host factors, including family history of allergy, 96 pre-existing atopy, [122] [123] [124] and impaired clearance of bacteria after acute infections, 18 also play a part in bacterial infections. Furthermore, children with early asthma and atopy might have reduced serum concentrations of bacteria-specifi c IgG, supporting a change in the underlying host immune response. 15\n",
            " Potential targets for the prevention and treatment of childhood asthma relate to either viruses or bacteria or to host factors that convey risk of asthma development. The most important route of viral transmission seems to be virus particles via self-inoculation of the conjunctivae and accessible respiratory mucosa after touching contaminated surfaces, hence purposeful hand hygiene is important. 125 Although fi rst results of anti-RSV antibodies (palivizumab 54, 55, 57 ) for prevention of viral induced wheeze are very promising in premature children, their preventive potential for children at risk of asthma has not been investigated. However, the prohibitive costs discourage clinical application without robust scientifi c evidence.\n",
            " Antibiotic treatment, particularly early in life, might do more harm than good as a preventive measure. Nevertheless, antibiotics are indispensable in pneumonia or other overt bacterial infections. Macrolide antibiotics might have a role in the prevention of asthma exacerbations in adults with severe asthma, 126 but data for children are scarce. Whether manipulation of the microbiota could in turn succeed is still open to debate. Because of confl icting results and safety issues in infants and immuno compromised individuals, at present no evidence supports prebiotic (containing nutrients such as oligosaccharides fostering growth of benefi cial bacteria in the colon), probiotic (benefi cial bacteria), or synbiotic (containing both nutrients and benefi cial bacteria) manipulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome to eff ectively prevent asthma. 127 125 Although the evidence of any benefi t of microbial products is weak, future developments in their application for the prevention and treatment of asthma are in progress. In view of the strong epidemiological evidence for protection from microbial exposures, these approaches could be promising as long as the safety of administered products is guaranteed.\n",
            " Alternatively, host factors that increase susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections could be targeted. External interferon β application, which aims to reduce virus shedding, especially to the lower airways after primary infection, is eff ective in adults with asthma, 29 and prophylactic intranasal treatment has eff ectively reduced HRV infection in adults. 125 However, the adverse systemic reactions, ethical constraints for testing in children, and Review the related cost prohibit broad use of interferon β in paediatric populations. Secondary prevention of atopy with subcutaneous or sublingual immunotherapy is possible. 128 Immuno therapy started early in life could have potential preventive action. However, subcutaneous injections are not acceptable for children younger than 5 years and sublingual administration has not been tested in young children. Administration of anti-IgE-antibodies (omalizumab) has decreased rates of (probably virus-induced) asthma exacerbations in inner-city school children, 129 but results have not yet been replicated.\n",
            " In view of the outlined evidence, we propose a comprehensive theory for the role of viruses and bacteria in the development of childhood asthma. Four primary components (host factors) could be attributable to the development of asthma: (i) altered airway function and mechanics; (ii) impaired mucosal immune responses; (iii) impaired systemic immune responses; and (iv) atopic sensitisation (fi gure). These components could be formed prenatally depending on the genetic back ground of the mother and off spring and the maternal environ mental exposures during pregnancy, such as tobacco smoke, antibiotic use, infections, and microbial environ ments.\n",
            " Viruses and bacteria mostly interact with the second component, but in patients with asthma the interface between the airways and the environment is most likely defective and disordered. This change in epithelial defence might be attributable to one or a combination of factors such as impaired repair mechanisms of damaged epithelia, 77 dysfunction of the epithelial barrier, 78 or defi cient innate immune responses at the mucosal surface, 15 which could result in airway infl ammation and particularly suitable conditions for dysbiosis and overgrowth of some bacteria-these bacteria might in turn reinforce airway infl ammation. Likewise, a disordered airway mucosa and weakened antiviral defence might hamper virus clearance and increase damage to the epithelial surface with each viral infection. 77, 130 Viral and bacterial communities might actively interact; overgrowth of specifi c bacteria can follow viral infections in the lower respiratory tract, suggesting bidirectional synergism (ie, viral pre disposition to bacterial colonisation and bacterial pre disposition to viral colonisation). 130 Although viral infection might also aff ect immune responses against pathogenic bacteria, 130 whether colonisation with specifi c bacteria such as those identifi ed in the airways of patients with asthma aff ect antiviral responses is unknown.\n",
            " The third component, impaired systemic immune responses-such as a Th2 bias in infancy and delayed immune maturation-could be involved in viral and bacterial infections or colonisation and might interact with local immune responses at the airway mucosa. The development of atopic sensitisation could in turn be aff ected by impaired systemic immune responses and innate immunity at mucosal surfaces. Thus, a widely diversifi ed network of interactions between the four primary components could have already been established at birth.\n",
            " The fourth component, atopy sensitisation, could be important because allergen exposure might induce a constant low-level infl ammatory state in the airways, facilitating subsequent allergen uptake by airway mucosal dendritic cells and mediation of Th2 responses. 15 Viral infection triggers both local and systemic changes to this steady state of constant basal infl ammation. 15, 21 Local Th2-polarisation is directly induced via binding of HRVs and house dust mite allergens to toll-like receptors, 131, 132 potentially enhancing each other's eff ect.\n",
            " Postnatally, two major developments can be delineated by their timecourse (fi gure). Transient wheeze can be prompted by viral infections, but not by other triggers such as allergens. 133 We propose that individuals with transient wheeze have normal mucosal and systemic immune responses to viral and bacterial exposures. In turn, changes in airway function or mechanics might play an essential part in the manifestation of symptoms early in life, 58 which disappear around age 2-3 years.\n",
            " Persistent wheeze or later development of asthma symptoms could occur, and might be determined by one or a combination of the four primary components at birth and postnatal environmental exposures. Non-atopic wheeze could mainly involve impaired and delayed mucosal and systemic immune responses, which might mature until school age when remission of symptoms occurs. 134 In individuals with atopic sensitisation early in life, viral and bacterial infections might enhance airway infl ammation, thereby further changing airway function and eventually resulting in chronic asthma. Environments rich in microbial exposures will in turn protect from a chronic course because they can counterbalance the impaired mucosal and systemic immune responses to strengthen antiviral, Th1, and innate immune responses. These exposures might also prevent harmful bacterial colonisation of the airway mucosa. Although evidence for mutualism between viruses and their host exists in nature, 135 whether there is also a role for \"good\" viruses in human beings, particularly in the context of airway disease, is unknown.\n",
            " We searched PubMed (MeSH) with the terms \"wheeze\" or \"asthma\" in combination with \"prenatal\", \"childhood\", and \"infections\". We largely selected publications from Nov 1, 2012, and Mar 31, 2013, but did not exclude commonly referenced older publications. In total, more than 468 abstracts were screened. We also searched the reference lists of identifi ed articles and selected articles we judged relevant. Review articles are cited to provide readers with more detail and further references.\n",
            " Although this concept is oversimplifi ed and contains many facets in each component and pathway, the proposed conceptual framework could help to relate the various eff ects of viral and bacterial infection to the development of asthma.\n",

            "Title: Ribosomal RNA depletion or exclusion has negligible effect on the detection of viruses in a pan viral microarray\n",
            "Body Text: The control of viral diseases is reliant on identifying the causative agent in order to help devise and implement appropriate control measures. Virus identification is less challenging when probing known viral diseases, in particular, those with characteristic clinical signs. However, some viral diseases are not pathognomonic and therefore challenging to diagnose as is the case when unknown or new viruses are involved. Most detection assays are dependent on the availability of antibodies, antigens or sequence information which are often lacking when investigating novel or divergent pathogens.\n",
            " Infectious diseases are emerging continuously in new species and geographical locations due to factors such as pathogen mutations, genetic reassortment, animal and human movement and climate change (Weiss and Mcmichael, 2004; Butler, 2012) . In this regard, RNA viruses are of particular concern, as they mutate at a higher rate than DNA viruses and lack proofreading enzymes to prevent errors during RNA replication (Holland et al., 1982) . The constant threat of new infectious diseases reiterates the need for rapid and multiplex detection assays such as microarrays, which can probe thousands of viruses simultaneously. In addition, these assays have the potential to detect viruses closely related to known viral pathogens and viral co-infections. Microarrays, however, do not come without challenges.\n",
            " Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is estimated to make up 80% of total cellular RNA, being comprised mostly of 28S and 18S rRNA species in mammals (De Vries et al., 2011) . The necessary use of sequence independent amplification to process tissues from unknown viral diseases results in co-amplification of host along with viral nucleic acids. This non-specific amplification is also thought to complicate the interpretation of readout values due to cross hybridization. The rRNA may also compete with viral RNA amplification and instigate lower detection sensitivity. Ribosomal RNA depletion methods, such as RiboMinus TM technology (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), were stated to improve microarray analysis (Gilbert et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2011) . In the RiboMinus TM protocol, rRNA molecules are depleted from total RNA using biotin labelled oligonucleotide probes, which hybridize to 18S, 28S, 5.8S and 5S rRNA before being removed with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The procedure has been found to reduce large rRNA by 80% (Gilbert et al., 2010) . Endoh and colleagues (2005) have used a mix of 96 non-rRNA binding hexamers, screened from 4096 hexamers, to exclude rRNA molecules from amplification. The procedure was claimed to decrease the amount of non-specific amplification and enhance the sensitivity of a virus discovery assay. The 96 hexamers were also shown to reduce rRNA amplification by >90% and to improve sensitivity of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) (De Vries et al., 2011) . The hexamers also increased microarray specificity and simplified its analytical process (Kang et al., 2011) . These studies, however, only looked at viruses isolated in cell culture and nasal swabs.\n",
            " The analytical process of microarrays is also complex and the interpretation of the output files is likely to be challenging (Kang et al., 2011) although bioinformatic tools have already been developed to improve and simplify data analysis, such as the DetectiV software (Watson et al., 2007) . Some studies have also looked at optimising sample processing, such as, reducing genomic DNA and optimising hybridization conditions (Han et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2011) . Although these steps have improved microarray detection rate significantly, cross hybridization and a comparatively low sensitivity still remain problematic when testing tissue samples. This study therefore compared the application of rRNA depletion or exclusion methods using tissue samples to investigate if either method can improve microarray detection of RNA viruses and simplify microarray analysis in comparison with the standard random priming protocol.\n",
            " A selection of virus positive tissue samples was used in this study (Table 1) . Tissue samples were homogenised and RNA was extracted using QIAamp ® Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) for tonsil samples or TRIzol (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) for brain samples following the manufacturers' protocols. Nucleic acid was quantified using Nanodrop 2000 spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Cheshire, UK) and diluted to a concentration of 4 g in 32 l of nuclease free water, from which three aliquots of 8 l were subjected to DNase digest using amplification grade DNase I (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Briefly, 1 l of 10× DNase buffer and 1 l of DNase I enzyme (1 units/l) were added to each 8 l nucleic acid extract and incubated at 37 • C for 30 min. 1 l of 25 mM EDTA was then added to the mix and incubated at 65 • C for 10 min to inactivate the DNase I enzyme.\n",
            " Ribosomal RNA was removed from one of the DNase digested aliquots of nucleic acid using the Ribominus TM Eukaryote Kit for RNA-Seq (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, for each viral extract, nucleic acid was added to 10 l of RiboMinus TM probe (15 pmol/l) and 100 l of hybridization buffer and incubated at 70-75 • C for 5 min. The sample was transferred to prepared RiboMinus TM Magnetic beads and incubated at 37 • C for 15 min. The beads were separated using a magnet leaving RiboMinus TM RNA (target RNA) in the supernatant, which was transferred into fresh RiboMinus TM beads. The sample was incubated at 15 • C for 15 min and the beads were separated. The nucleic acid was precipitated finally with ethanol and re-suspended in 11 l of water before being converted into cDNA using the random priming protocol (Section 2.3.1).\n",
            " 2.3. cDNA synthesis 2.3.1. Using random primer A (random priming)\n",
            " The tailed primer A, 5 GTT TCC CAG TCA CGA TAN NNN NNN NN 3 , referred to hereafter as primer A, was used to generate random cDNA from the rRNA depleted nucleic acid (Section 2.2) and the second aliquot of nucleic acid as described by Wang et al. (2002) . Briefly, 1 l of 12.5 mM dNTP (Promega, Southampton, UK) and 1 l of 40 M primer A were added to each of the two aliquots. The mixtures were then heated at 95 • C for 5 min and chilled on ice immediately. 4 l 5× RT buffer (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), 1 l 0.1 M DTT, 1 l RNasin Ribonuclease inhibitor (20-40 u/l, Promega) and 1 l Superscript III (200 u/l) (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) were then added and the mix was incubated at 25 • C for 5 min, 42 • C for 60 min and 70 • C for 15 min to stop the reaction.\n",
            " The third aliquot of nucleic acid was converted into cDNA using the 50 hexamers (Section 3.1) and following the random priming protocol, but replacing the primer A with the 50 hexamers at a concentration of 80 M.\n",
            " This was carried out as described by Wang et al. (2002) with minor modification for the cDNA generated using the 50 hexamers. Briefly, cDNA was denatured at 94 • C for 2 min and cooled to 10 • C before adding Sequenase enzyme mix [2 l 5× Sequenase buffer (Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK), 0.3 l Sequenase DNA polymerase and 7.7 l water]. This mix for the cDNA generated with the 50 hexamers had an additional 1 l of 40 M primer A. The reactions were heated from 10 to 37 • C over an 8 min period using a Veriti thermocycler (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and held at 37 • C for another 8 min before being terminated at 94 • C for 2 min. Amplification of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was performed using a mix containing 5 l 10× KlenTaq PCR buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK), 1 l 12.5 mM dNTP mix, 1 l 100 M primer amino-B (amino-C6 5 GTT TCC CAG TCA CGA TA 3 ), 0.5 l KlenTaq ® LA DNA polymerase (5 units/l), 5 l of template and water to a total volume of 50 l. The thermal profile used was 94 • C for 4 min, 68 • C for 5 min then 35 cycles of 94 • C for 30 s, 50 • C for 1 min, 68 • C for 1 min and a final extension of 68 • C for 2 min. The amplified PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel with SYBR ® safe DNA gel stain (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and visualised on a trans UV illuminator (Bio Rad, Hertfordshire, UK), which should show a smear between 200 and 1000 bp.\n",
            " Indirect labelling of the amplified DNA templates (5 l) was performed using 15-20 cycles of PCR which incorporates amino allyl dUTP (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) into the reaction (Gurrala et al., 2009) . The labelled products were purified using the MinElute PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) following the manufacturer's protocol, substituting the wash buffer with 75% ethanol and eluting the sample in 13 l of water. The fluorescent dye was coupled to the amino allyl labelled PCR product by adding 6 l of Sodium Bicarbonate (25 mg in 1 ml of water) and 4 l of Alexa Fluor ® 647 Reactive Dye (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), reconstituted in 18 l of DMSO, to the eluted DNA, vortexing and incubating at room temperature in the dark for up to two hours. The coupling reaction was made to a volume of 50 l with water before unincorporated dye was removed using the illustra TM AutoSeq TM G-50 Dye terminator removal Kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n",
            " The pan-viral microarray chip used in this study contained 47,000 probes (60 mers) to around 2,500 virus species. The chip was printed by Agilent Technologies (Cheshire, UK) in an 8 × 60 K format so that 8 samples could be processed simultaneously.\n",
            " The hybridization mix was composed of 2.5 l Cot-1 DNA (1.0 mg/ml, Kreatech Diagnostics, East Sussex, UK), 5 l Agilent 10× blocking agent, 25 l Agilent 2X hi-RPM buffer and 17.5 l of the labelled product. The mix was heated on a thermocycler at 95 • C for 3 min and 37 • C for 30 min before being applied onto the gasket slide. A microarray slide was then lowered onto the gasket slide and secured inside an Agilent hybridization chamber. The chamber was placed into a pre-heated rotating hybridization oven (Agilent Technologies, Cheshire, UK) at 65 • C and set to rotate at 10 rpm overnight. The slide, whilst attached to the gasket slide, was submerged into room temperature Agilent Oligo aCGH/Chip-onchip wash buffer 1 (Agilent Technologies, Cheshire, UK) to remove the gasket slide. The microarray slide was then transferred into a fresh jar of the buffer and washed applying a magnetic stirrer for 5 min. The slide was transferred subsequently into pre-warmed 37 • C buffer 2 and washed for another 1 min before being scanned. The slide was scanned on a microarray Agilent C scanner with 2 micron resolution as instructed by the manufacturer. The output file from the Feature Extraction software of the scanner was analysed using DetectiV software in R (http://www.R-project.org) (Watson et al., 2007) , using data from an unrelated experiment to correct for the background noise. Known virus samples were used to compare p-value and/or the average value of normalised signal intensities in microarray data analysis in order to identify the target virus.\n",
            " The virus specific real time PCR mix for all viruses except rabies virus (RV) was composed of 1× QuantiTect Virus + ROX Vial Kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), forward and reverse primers at a final concentration of 0.4 M and virus specific TaqMan probe at a final concentration of 0.2 M, 1× ROX, 3 l of template DNA and water to total a volume of 20 l (Mcgoldrick et al., 1998; Lanciotti et al., 2000; Marriott et al., 2006; Bilk et al., 2012) The thermal profile used was 95 • C for 5 min and 45 cycles of 95 • C for 15 s, 60 • C for 45 s. The 18S rRNA real time PCR was performed using 0.6 l 18S rRNA primers/probe mix (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), the Quan-tiTect Virus + ROX Vial Kit as described above and 2 l template DNA. For RV, 10 l Brilliant ® II SYBR ® Green QPCR with low ROX master mix (Agilent Technologies, Cheshire, UK) was used with JW12 and N165-146 primers, each totalling a final concentration of 1 M, 3 l template DNA and water to a final volume of 20 l (Wakeley et al., 2005) . The thermal profile used was 94 • C for 2 min, 45 cycles of 95 • C for 1 min, 55 • C for 30 s and 72 • C for 20 s. Each sample was tested in duplicate and a no-template control (NTC) was also included in each run to check for cross contamination and background noise.\n",
            " Fifty hexamers (Supplement 1) from the list of 96 hexamers described in Endoh et al., 2005 were selected after verifying that they are not present in: equine 18S rRNA, porcine 18S rRNA, bovine 18S and 28S rRNA, and human 18S and 28S rRNA sequences (accession numbers AJ311673, AY265350.1, DQ222453 and U13369 respectively). The BLAST program from the SANGER Institute was used to find the hits between the hexamers and the sequences. The ensuing 50 hexamers were then mapped to genome sequences of several viruses of human and animal importance (Table 2 ). This was to assess the number of binding sites of the 50 hexamers on the viral genomes and also to measure the nucleotide distance between the binding sites. Among the viruses used, Louping Ill virus (LIV) genome had the lowest binding sites and also the largest distance between the binding sites, prompting us to include this virus in the study to evaluate the efficiency of the 50 hexamers in generating cDNA. Furthermore, in order to assess whether the 50 hexamers performance could be influenced by low viral load, serial 10-fold dilutions of a Classical Swine Fever virus (CSFV) positive nucleic acid were made in nucleic acid derived from a virus negative tissue. The nucleic acid dilutions were then subjected to cDNA synthesis using the 50 hexamers or random priming followed by CSFV qPCR to quantify the virus-specific amplicons. The Ct values, obtained by the qPCR for each of the CSFV nucleic acid dilutions using either of the two protocols, were comparable with only minor differences. The average CSFV Ct values for random priming were 25.3, 24.2, 27.9, 31.2 compared to 26.6, 24.1, 27.1 and 30.8 for the 50 hexamers using neat, 10 −1 , 10 −2 and 10 −3 CSFV dilutions, respectively.\n",
            " The three methods, the 50 hexamers, RiboMinus TM , and random priming, produced PCR amplicons of the expected size range, smears of 200-1000 bp, on agarose gel (data not shown) using CSFV, LIV, West Nile virus (WNV) and RV positive nucleic acids as targets. The 50 hexamers were found to be just as efficient as the random priming in producing cDNA, even for viruses with few binding sites for the hexamers, such as LIV. In addition, the use of hexamers resulted in the most evenly spread DNA smears, indicating an arbitrary amplification of total nucleic acid.\n",
            " Virus specific qPCRs were carried out to quantify the amount of virus amplicons obtained for each virus using the 50 hexamer, RiboMinus TM and random priming protocols (Table 3) . Considering the Ct values, there appears to be no pattern to suggest that any of the three protocols are contributing to a higher sensitivity in amplifying viral nucleic acid extracted from tissues samples. The removal or exclusion of rRNA from virus positive tissues was also quantified by an 18S rRNA qPCR using cDNA, generated with the 50 hexamers, RiboMinus TM and random priming protocols, as template (Table 4 ). The cDNAs generated with the 50 hexamers showed marginal effect whilst the RiboMinus TM protocol demonstrated a clear decrease in rRNA, compared to those cDNAs generated with random priming protocol.\n",
            " The effect of removing rRNA on microarray specificity, sensitivity and ease of data interpretation was assessed by analysing microarray outputs from the three protocols and seven known positive virus samples. Averages and p-values of probes' fluorescent intensity from each virus, calculated by the DetectiV software, were considered in the interpretation of microarray outputs. The 50 hexamers, RiboMinus TM and random priming had 86%, 71% and 86% detection rates respectively if p values of probes signal intensity were considered for virus identification. The only difference was in the detection of low CSFV where the RiboMinus TM protocol used for sample processing. The detection rate was; however, 100% for the three protocols when the averages of signal intensity of virus probes were interrogated to identify the target virus.\n",
            " To investigate whether depletion or exclusion of rRNA could reduce cross hybridization of the target virus nucleic acid with unrelated probes on the microarray, the proportion of variance between average of probes fluorescent intensity for the top virus hit and those of 19 unrelated viruses cascading below was visualised using Scree plots ( Fig. 1 and Supplement 2) . Visually, there was no difference in the reduction of cross hybridization frequency among the three methods. The three sample processing protocols Table 4 Quantitative PCR of 18S rRNA in cDNAs generated using the 50 hexamers, RiboMinus TM and random priming protocols.\n",
            " Cycle threshold ( showed a large difference in the average frequency from the target virus to the unrelated virus hits enabling a clear identification of target virus.\n",
            " Microarray has proven to be a successful tool in detecting novel viruses and viral co-infections establishing itself as a front-line diagnostic tool for investigation of emerging infectious diseases. Enhancing assay's performance and thereby simplifying interpretation of its output is therefore critical for its use in routine diagnostic testing. Improvements have already been made in the analytical process by using statistical software, such as DetectiV (Watson et al., 2007) , to enable an easier analysis and interrogation of microarray outputs. Many groups have also attempted to improve sample preparation (Han et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2011; Nicholson et al., 2011) whilst others worked on depleting rRNA from extracted nucleic acid for the same purpose (Endoh et al., 2005; Gilbert et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2011) . This study looked at implementing two different rRNA depletion or exclusion methods to assess whether an improvement to microarray detection of RNA viruses from tissue samples could be made. RiboMinus TM technology and non-rRNA binding hexamers were the two methods used in this study and compared with the in-use random priming method. The 50 hexamers were selected from the originally described 96 hexamers (Endoh et al., 2005) to further reduce rRNA binding hexamers in order to increase their selectivity towards viral RNAs.\n",
            " The 50 hexamers did not hamper amplification of virus nucleic acid from tissue samples, even from those samples with low viral load. However, only a small decrease in 18S rRNA load could be achieved by the hexamers with no repercussion on microarray detection. On the contrary, De Vries et al. (2011) found non-rRNA binding hexamers reduced 28S rRNA amplification by up to 100 fold depending on the region of the rRNA genome used for quantification. The work, however, was carried out using only nasopharyngeal swabs which have trivial amounts of cell contamination in comparison to tissue samples. Furthermore, as a commercial primers-probe mix was used in the study, it was not possible to verify which region of 28S or 18S rRNA genome was targeted by the PCR for comparison.\n",
            " RiboMinus TM technology was successful in removing rRNA to a large extent, as also indicated by other researchers (Gilbert et al., 2010) . However, no difference in microarray detection was observed compared to the random priming protocol, especially when applied to deplete rRNA from samples with a low viral load. This may be due to the length of nucleic acid handling time and several steps of separations and washes in the RiboMinus TM protocol, causing degradation and poor recovery of viral nucleic acid. Therefore, the protocol may have removed rRNA effectively, but in the meantime affected adversely viral nucleic acid integrity. In addition, RiboMinus TM Technology is comparatively expensive and time consuming, which restricts its application where a high throughput testing is sought. For these reasons, it would be unrealistic to justify implementing RiboMinus TM Technology, unless it was highly effective at improving a test, which we cannot confirm for microarray. However, RiboMinus TM or similar technologies may prove to be beneficial in enrichment of pathogen specific sequences from NGS libraries prepared from complex matrices, e.g. tissues samples.\n",
            " On the whole, the microarray results for all three methods showed no difference in the overall detection rates and the amount of cross hybridization seen. Kang et al. (2011) found that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides had improved the microarrays specificity. However, all the samples used in the evaluation were virus isolates, which often contain a small amount of cellular contamination and therefore cannot represent tissue samples used for microarray analysis in its intended clinical application. In addition, host genomes were only removed prior to nucleic acid extraction for the experiment carried out with non-rRNA oligonucleotides, which may account for the improvement. The script used to run the DetectiV software may also have been a major contributing factor for equal performance of the three protocols seen in this study, especially when analysing cross hybridization. The software employs a script with instructions to subtract florescence data of an unrelated sample from those of an in-test sample. This background adjustment has already minimised the effect of cross hybridization signals and may have contributed to the comparable outcome for the three protocols. The importance of using signal averages in addition to p-values in microarray analysis was also identified, as the detection rate was found to be lower when using the p-value only. This is due to variability in the signal intensity among individual probes and probe numbers representing a virus. The original work describing the DetectiV software (Watson et al., 2007) has relied only on the p values to analyse microarray outputs. Finally, tissue samples from experimental conditions, which harbour a higher load of rRNA, compared to cell culture isolates, may have rendered a lower efficiency for the rRNA exclusion of the 50 hexamers. The short length of hexamers and consequently nonspecific binding may also contribute to the findings of this study, therefore longer oligonucleotides, e.g. nonamers may be more applicable.\n",
            " In conclusion, this study identified that the two rRNA depletion or exclusion protocols have no significant effect on microarray detection or reduction in cross hybridization. Accordingly, the current random amplification and background adjustment protocols are pertinent for the purpose of investigating novel and emerging diseases via microarray analysis whilst the findings also emphasize the importance of selecting the most appropriate samples for analysis. Protocols suggesting improvement for nucleic acid preparation should also include tissue samples on validation if intended for diagnostic purposes.\n",
            " This study concludes that the two procedures, RiboMinus TM technology and non-rRNA binding hexanucleotides, described to deplete or exclude rRNA, have little effect on the microarrays detection and analysis and might only in combination with further techniques result in a significant enhancement of sensitivity.\n",
            " Currently, existing protocols of random amplification and background adjustment are pertinent for the purpose of sample processing for microarray analysis.\n",

            "Title: Programmable icosahedral shell system for virus trapping\n",
            "Body Text: For the majority of viral diseases, no effective treatment is available. Broadly applicable antiviral platform technologies do not exist. Here, we propose a platform technology that considers trapping entire virus particles within de novo designed macromolecular shells to inhibit molecular interactions between viruses and host cells (Fig. 1a) . We envision shells that can augment and work synergistically with a large variety of virus binding moieties, whether by themselves neutralizing or not, to create an effective antiviral agent.\n",
            " To accomplish this function, the shells must on the one hand be large enough to accommodate entire viruses, while also be chemically addressable to allow including virus-specificity conferring moieties on the shell's interior surface. The extended surface of the shells enables functionalization in a multivalent fashion. Multivalency can support tight binding of a target virus even for individually weakly virus-binding molecules, as exemplified in previous experiments with phage nanoparticles engineered to trivalently bind influenza A hemagglutinin (1) , and with star-shaped DNA aptamer clusters that simultaneously target multiple dengue virus envelope proteins (2) . With shells that fully cover viruses, an even larger degree of multivalency, and thus stronger binding, can be envisioned. Modular functionalization of the shells with virus binders will enable using the same type of shell platform to target a variety of viruses. Candidate virus binders could be e.g. antibodies, designed proteins (3), nucleic acid aptamers, or polymers such as heparan sulphates (4) . In our concept, the shell material, rather than the moieties directly contacting the virus, will mainly prevent access to the viral surface. Therefore, in principle any virus binding molecule could potentially be utilized to convert the shells into an effective virus neutralizing trap.\n",
            " Our shell concept requires constructing massive molecular complexes that are adaptable to cover the dimensions of viral pathogens (~ 20 nm to ~ 500 nm (5)), which poses a fundamental nanoengineering challenge. Protein designers have previously succeeded in creating artificial macromolecular cages (7) (8) (9) (10) . However, the designed protein-cages are much smaller than the vast majority of natural viruses and cannot be easily modified. DNA nanotechnology (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) can create discrete objects with structurally well-defined 3D shapes (17, 18) , including higher-order objects (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) with molecular masses exceeding one Gigadalton (24) . However, these previous designs and the underlying concepts yield objects that are either too small, assemble with insufficient yields, do not match the shapes of viruses, or are too flexible or skeletal to be suitable for effectively trapping and occluding entire virus particles.\n",
            " To build the envisioned virus trap, we created a programmable icosahedral shell \"canvas\" by adapting symmetry principles known from natural viral capsids. Caspar and Klug elucidated the geometric principles that govern the structure of natural viral capsids in 1962 (25) . According to Caspar and Klug theory, which has been expanded recently (26) , the number of distinct environments occupied by proteins within an icosahedral capsid is described by its triangulation number (T-number), which can be computed by the arrangement of pentamers and hexamers within an icosahedral capsid (T=h 2 +hk+k 2 , Fig. 1b) . The total number of proteins required to build a natural capsid is T times sixty. This is because natural protein subunits are, by default, asymmetric and homo-trimerization is minimally required to construct a three-fold symmetric subunit that can assemble into an icosahedral shell with twenty triangular faces. To build larger capsids, viruses use more than one capsid protein or capsid proteins that can adopt different conformations. The structure of natural virus capsids forms the basis for our synthetic programmable icosahedral shell canvasses, which we analogously classify using a T-number.\n",
            " To implement the icosahedral canvas concept, we designed pseudo-symmetric triangular subunits (Fig. 1c) based on multi-layer DNA origami concepts (12, 13) . Each side of a triangular subunit is the equivalent of one protein subunit of a natural viral capsid. The overall canvas scale and type are controlled by geometric instructions provided by the triangular subunits. These instructions are given by the choice of the length, the topological binding pattern (27) , and the bevel angle of each triangular edge. Since in our system each triangular edge represents one protein, the Caspar and Klug triangulation number gives the number of unique triangular edges required to build a particular icosahedral canvas shell. Hence, T=1 and T=3 shells may both be built with a single triangle, with three identical edges for T=1 and three different edges for a T=3 shell (Fig. 1c, 1d, left) . A T=4 shell requires two separate triangular subunits, for example, one triangle with three unique edges and another with three identical edges (Fig. 1c, 1d , middle). A T=9 shell requires three different triangles, each having three unique edges (Fig. 1c, 1d , right). The greater the T number, the greater the overall number of triangles per target shell, given by 20T. We used design solutions in which all triangle bevel angles for a particular target shell were the same. While T=9 was the largest canvas we set out to build, we also designed triangular subunits for a smaller octahedral container (\"O\") ( Fig. 1c, 1d , left).\n",
            " We used iterative design with caDNAno (28) paired with elastic-network-guided molecular dynamics simulations (29) to produce candidate designs. To approximate target bevel angles, we tuned the helical connectivity of the triangle edges in the vertices ( Supplementary Fig.  1 ). These candidate designs were encoded in DNA sequences using the methods of DNA origami (12, 30) and self-assembled in one-pot reaction mixtures (31) . Gel-electrophoretic folding quality analysis demanded some design iterations to improve triangular subunit assembly yields ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). To validate the 3D structures of the designed triangles, we studied all triangle subunits using cryo transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single particle analysis (Fig. 2) . The resulting 3D electron maps had resolutions ranging from 13 to 22 Angstroms (Supplementary Fig. 3-10) , which allowed us to evaluate the overall 3D shapes, the observed versus desired bevel angles (Supplementary Table 1 , deviations within 5°), the correct formation of the binding patterns, and the occurrence of systematic folding defects. For instance, one triangle variant (T hex1 ) had a defective vertex, which decreased its ability to form lateral edge-to-edge interactions ( Supplementary Fig.  11 ). Based on the cryo-EM data, we refined the design and eliminated the defect.\n",
            " The triangle variants self-assembled (see methods) successfully into the designed icosahedral shells, as confirmed by direct imaging with cryo-EM (Fig. 2a , Supplementary  Fig. 12-16 ). Inspection of individual particles (Fig. 2a) and of 2D class averages (Fig. 2b-f ) revealed particles displaying the designed symmetries. For example, the three symmetry axes of the octahedron (4-fold, 3-fold, 2-fold, Fig. 2b ) and T=1 shell (5-fold, 3-fold, 2-fold, Fig. 2c ) can be clearly seen. For the higher-T-number shells, the underlying triangular net predicted from the Caspar-and-Klug representation became clearly visible ( Fig. 2d-g) . We determined 3D EM maps from the image data by imposing the respective symmetry ( Fig. 2b-e) . The resulting maps had resolutions ranging from 20 to 40 Angstrom. For the octahedron and T=1 shell, 3D maps reconstructed without imposing any a priori symmetry superimposed well with the sibling reconstructed with imposed symmetry ( Supplementary  Fig. 12,13) . We classified and treated cryo-EM maps of shells that lacked one or multiple triangles separately from complete shells to assess quality and yield ( Supplementary Fig.  12,13 ). The largest T=9 shells were imaged using negative stain EM tomography (Fig. 2f ,g, Supplementary Fig. 17 ). Sections through tomograms of assembled T=9 shells show fully closed shells as well as the correct arrangement of pentamers according to the designed T-number (arrows in Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 17 ).\n",
            " To elucidate effects of orientational specificity of subunit-subunit interactions, we varied the bevel angle of the T=1 subunits from the ideal geometry (α=20.9°). We designed two additional variants of the T=1 triangle whose bevel angles deviated by +5° or -5° from the icosahedral ideal. The decrease or increase of the bevel angle caused the appearance of larger or smaller, often defective, assemblies in addition to T=1 shells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 18 ). Based on these data we conclude that the correct target bevel angle in a T=1 triangle subunit must be matched within a range of +-5°.\n",
            " As a demonstration for a route for sealing the remaining cavities in the shells, we built a DNA brick having a triangular cross-section roughly corresponding to the dimensions of the triangular cavity in the shell subunits. We anchored the brick via multiple attachment points to the outer surface of a T=1 shell triangle (Supplementary Fig. 19 for design details, Supplementary Fig. 20 for a cryo-EM map). We solved a structure of the spiky T=1 shell using cryo-EM single particle analysis (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 21 ). The resulting map overlaps well with those of the unmodified T=1 shell, but the central cavity of the triangle subunits is now blocked by the added brick module ( Supplementary Fig. 21 ). The fact that the cavity-plugging with the DNA brick worked indicates robustness and structural modularity of our shells. The brick may also be considered as a mimic for previously described DNA-based membrane channels (32) or for any other functional module that one wishes to attach to a shell.\n",
            " We evaluated practical aspects such as assembly yield and stability in physiological conditions where the system is ultimately expected to be applied. Low-density gel electrophoretic mobility analysis (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 22 ) revealed that shell assembly proceeded by disappearance of the triangular monomers, appearance of a smear indicating the presence of oligomeric species, followed by emergence of a dominant high intensity band, corresponding to the fully formed shells. Octahedra and T=1 shells formed within 15 and 60 minutes, respectively, which is sufficiently fast to enable self-assembly of these shells directly during the one-pot triangle-folding reaction ( Supplementary Fig. 23 ). They formed with a final complete shell yield of ~95% and ~70%, respectively. The T=3 and T=4 shells formed with about 40% yield (Fig. 3a) . Subunit-exchange experiments with fluorescently labeled subunits revealed that under shell-favoring conditions triangles that are incorporated in closed shells do not exchange with solution ( Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig.  24 ). Under equilibrium conditions, triangles do exchange (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 24 ). To stabilize the shells for application in physiological fluids, we first assembled the shells and then applied UV point welding (33) to create additional internal covalent bonds across the stacking contacts in the triangle subunits. We then coated the shells with a mixture of oligolysine and PEG oligolysine (34) . This two-step treatment allowed us to successfully transfer the shells into mouse serum, where the shells remained intact for up to 24 h (Fig.  3c ).\n",
            " By changing the geometry of the shape-complementary topographic features, the triangular subunits can be programmed to cover only user-defined areas on the icosahedral canvas. To create full shells, only the minimum number of different topographic interaction patterns (\"symmetries\") is implemented as discussed above. Introducing additional types of topographic edge-to-edge interactions per triangular subunit allows reducing the symmetry in which the subunit may be integrated in the canvas. Furthermore, the stacking interactions can be modularly activated and de-activated, for example by shortening a strand terminus involved in a stacking contact or by adding unpaired thymidine terminal strand extensions. Together, these features enable sculpting a variety of objects on the icosahedral canvas in a programmable fashion, including full shells, pentagonal vertices, (spherical) half-shells, and shells with virus-sized openings using rational design decisions.\n",
            " To design such objects, we used the triangular net projection of the chosen icosahedral canvas type as a drawing board ( Fig. 4a-e) . For example, in order to prepare half instead of full octahedra, complementary lock-and-key interactions of two edges of the triangular subunit are needed and one edge interaction must be deactivated (Fig. 4a) . A pentagonal dome can be analogously created based on the T=1 icosahedral canvas (Fig. 4b) . Building an icosahedral half shell requires two different triangular subunits, one that forms the pentagonal dome, and another that specifically docks onto the edges of the pentamer (Fig.  4c) . A ring-like \"sheath\" may also be built by two triangles (Fig. 4d ). To build a T=1 shell variant with one missing pentagon vertex, three triangular subunit variants with a specific interaction pattern are needed (Fig. 4e ). We practically implemented the above discussed design variants using appropriately modified triangular building blocks ( Fig. 4f -h, Supplementary Fig. 25) . The building blocks self-assembled successfully into the desired higher-order objects based on their icosahedral canvas, which we validated experimentally by determining cryo EM solution structures ( Fig. 4i- \n",
            " Viruses can be trapped in, or coordinated by, pre-assembled icosahedral shell segments featuring sufficiently large apertures ( Fig. 5a ,b, Supplementary Fig. 30 ). Alternatively, protective shells can be formed directly on the surface of virus particles (Fig. 5c ). Both approaches are illustrated in experiments we performed with hepatitis B virus core particles (HBV) (Fig. 5a -c inset, red). To confer specificity to HBV, we conjugated anti-HBc 17H7 (Isotype IgG-2b) to the DNA shells by hybridization of ssDNA-labeled antibodies to a set of anchor points on the triangle subunits ( Fig. 5a -c inset, cyan). We did not observe any HBV binding in the absence of HBV antibodies ( Supplementary Fig. 31 ), nor in the presence of antibodies specific for other targets ( Supplementary Fig. 31 ).\n",
            " We determined 3D cryo EM maps of octahedral and T=1 half shells with trapped HBV core particles (Fig. 5d ,e, Supplementary Fig. 32,33 ). For the half-octahedral variant, the majority of particles consisted of two opposing half octahedra coordinating a single HBV core particle in their middle (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 32 ). The micrographs and the cryo EM map also reveal signatures reflecting the antibodies that link the DNA shell to the trapped HBV core particle (Fig. 5d, right) . Similar antibody signatures may be found in the image data with the half T=1 shell-HBV complex (Fig. 5e, right) . We also trapped HBV core particles in larger T=1 shell variants with a missing pentagon vertex ( Fig. 5f ) which can accommodate multiple HBV particles in their interior cavities (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Fig.  30 ).\n",
            " To test the capacity of our shells to prevent a trapped virus to undergo interactions with surfaces, we performed in vitro virus blocking assays with HBV-binding antibodies immobilized on a solid surface (Fig. 5g, Supplementary Fig. 34 ). We quantified the extent of HBV core particle binding to the surface via binding of an orthogonal HBV core-specific reporter antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Residual HBV core particles that are bound to the surface are detected via HRP catalyzed production of a colorimetric signal. In the presence of our virus-engulfing shells (half T=1 shells), virus interactions with the surface were blocked up to 99% (Fig. 5h) , thus confirming the interaction-inhibiting capacity of our shells. Control experiments with shells lacking HBV trapping antibody resulted in minimal virus blocking compared to the signal generated by naked HBV core particles that represent baseline 0% virus blocking.\n",
            " HBV core particles directly incubated with antibodies, but without any shells present, were negligibly blocked from binding the surface. This finding indicates that the antibodies by themselves do not fully passivate the HBV capsid surface even though they were added at 400-fold excess over HBV particles. However, in contrast, when using the shells functionalized with on average as few as five antibodies, we achieved a virus blocking efficiency of greater than 80%. The blocking was nearly complete (up to 99%) when using more than five antibodies in the shells. The data thus shows that the shell-trapping method can be highly effective even when only a handful of physical interactions are formed between the virus surface and surrounding shell. Our data indicates that the shells, and not the antibodies used for holding the virus inside the shell, shield the virus from its exterior by steric occlusion.\n",
            " We tested the neutralization capacity of the DNA-origami half octahedron shells using adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) (35) virions carrying an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression cassette (36) using both microscopy and flow cytometry (Fig. 6a) . We stabilized DNA shells with UV point welding and PEG-oligolysine/ oligolysine as described above. AAV2 particles were successfully trapped in DNA half shells functionalized with anti-AAV2 antibody in the shell interior, in serum in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as seen by direct imaging with TEM (Fig. 6b ). Since AAV belongs to a completely different virus family than HBV, this data also establishes the modularity of the shell: by swapping out the virus-binding moieties one can trap different types of viruses.\n",
            " We quantified the efficacy of virus neutralization by determining the dose response curves for DNA half-shells functionalized with on average 36 anti-AAV2 antibodies per half-shell and free anti-AAV2 antibodies as reference ( Supplementary Fig. 35 ). The number of eGFP positive cells served as a readout for infection efficacy using flow cytometry analysis. The DNA half shells neutralized AAV2 with an estimated half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of ~0.3 nM (Supplementary Fig. 35 ). At our conditions, the IC 50 corresponded to approximately 2.5 half-shells per infectious virus particle. The DNA half shells had increased neutralization capacity compared to the activity of the free anti-AAV2 (Fig. 6c ,d, Supplementary Fig. 35 ). This neutralization enhancement is best appreciated in fluorescence microscopy images (Fig. 6d) , where few eGFP positive cells remain in the samples with AAV2-trapping DNA half shells, whereas many eGFP positive cells appear in samples exposed to the identical dose of anti-AAV2 antibodies free in solution. This experiment demonstrates that the shells function in physiological conditions with live cells. It also shows that the shells can further augment the already quite potent neutralization capabilities of the anti-AAV2 antibodies. As above with the in vitro HBV blocking experiments in figure  4 , the enhanced neutralization suggests that the shells trap viruses in a multivalent fashion and that the shell material additionally contributes as a viral-surface occluding agent.\n",
            " We also investigated whether the DNA-origami half shells without any conjugated antibody had an effect, and we found a low but non-negligible neutralization activity at the highest origami concentration tested ( Supplementary Fig. 35 ). We suggest this activity arises from electrostatic interactions between the PEG-oligolysine/oligolysine coated DNA-shells, and the AAV2 particles. Finally, we tested if exposure to the DNA half shells had any effect on cell viability and found no significant effect across any of the concentrations used in this study ( Supplementary Fig. 35 ).\n",
            " We envision that trapping viruses in shells can decrease the viral load in acute viral infections by preventing viruses from undergoing host cell interactions. We tested the virus trapping concept successfully with HBV core and AAV2 virus particles. We achieved near complete inactivation by engulfing HBV in a surrounding shell in vitro and could also effectively block AAV from infecting live cells. Due to the modularity of the DNA shells, other virus binders could be used. For example, host receptor domains or peptides known to be targeted by a viral pathogen and DNA / RNA aptamers could be conjugated to the shells. One of our design solutions, the half T=1 shell, featured 90 sites for anchoring virus-binding moieties in the interior cavity. This high level of multivalency will be particularly useful for trapping pathogens for which only low-affinity binders are available. Multiple different antibodies could also be combined to achieve higher specificity against a single target or against a plurality of targets.\n",
            " Our icosahedral shells consist of DNA, which is durable, available commercially, and easily functionalized and modified. The components needed for our shells can be mass produced biotechnologically (37) . Using DNA-based agents can potentially circumvent neutralization, phagocytosis, and degradation by pathways of the innate and adaptive immune system targeting protein structures. We expect our shells to be largely non-toxic because they do not target any enzymes of the host metabolism as many current antivirals do. However, we cannot exclude that nucleic-acid specific reactions such as activation of pattern-recognition receptors recognizing DNA (38, 39) or induction of DNA-binding antibodies may occur once the shells are applied in vivo. Testing our concept and assessing potentially adverse effects in organisms are important challenges for the future. Beyond the proposed application as virus traps, our programmable icosahedral canvas system also offers opportunities to create antigen-carriers for vaccination, DNA or RNA carriers for gene therapy or gene modification, drug delivery vehicles, and protective storage containers (see Supplementary Fig. 36 for cargo loading examples).\n",
            " All self-assembly experiments were performed in standardized \"folding buffers\" containing x mM MgCl 2 in addition to 5 mM Tris Base, 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM NaCl at pH 8 (FoBx). Single-scaffold-chain DNA-origami objects were self-assembled in one-pot folding reactions containing 50 nM scaffold DNA and 200 nM of each staple strand. The individual scaffolds were produced as described previously (41, 42) (see Supplementary Note for sequence). Folding buffer (FoB20) was used with x = 20 mM MgCl 2 . All reaction mixtures were subjected to thermal annealing ramps as detailed in Supplementary Table 2 in Tetrad (Bio-Rad) thermal cycling devices. Staple strands were purchased from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies).\n",
            " All shell subunits were purified using gel purification and, if necessary, concentrated with ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra 500 μl with 100kDa molecular weight cutoff) before self-assembling the subunits into shells. Both procedures were performed as previously described (31) with the following alterations: for gel purification, we used 1.5% agarose gels containing 0.5x TBE and 5.5 mM MgCl 2 . For ultrafiltration, the same filter was filled with gel-purified sample multiple times (about 2-5 times, ~400 μl every step) in order to increase the concentration of objects that are recovered from the filter. Before putting the filter upside down in a new filter tube, we performed two washing steps with 1xFoB5 (~400 μl) to achieve well-defined buffer conditions for the shell assembly. To assemble the purified (and concentrated) shell subunits into shells we adjusted the subunit and MgCl 2 concentrations by adding 1xFoB5 and 1.735 M MgCl 2 in suitable amounts. Typical subunit concentrations were in the range of 5 nM and up to 100 nM (for cryo-EM measurements, see Supplementary Table 3 ). Typical MgCl 2 concentrations for shell self-assembly were in the range of 10-40 mM. Shell self-assembly was performed at 40°C. Reaction times were varied depending on the shell type (see Fig. 3a ). Both, all shell subunits and assembled shells, can be stored at room temperature for several months.\n",
            " The T=1 triangle and the triangular brick (Fig. 2h) were dimerized using single stranded DNA sticky ends protruding from the T=1 triangle. The protruding sequences contained three thymidines for flexibility plus 7 base long sequence motifs that were directly complementary to single stranded scaffold domains of the brick (Supplementary Fig. 43B ). Dimerization reactions were performed at room temperature overnight using a monomer concentration of 40 nM in the presence of 11 mM MgCl 2 .\n",
            " Nine staples of the T=1 shell subunits were modified by adding 16 bases on the 5' ends. These nine modified staples and unmodified T=1 staples are folded with p8064 scaffold to produce T=1 triangles with nine ssDNA \"handles\" (Supplementary Fig. 36A, left) . The 16-base ssDNA handles are located on the shell-inward facing surface of the monomers. 8 of those 9 strands were oriented facing inwards towards the interior of the monomer and consequently may not have been accessible to the cargo. Single-stranded DNA cargo was prepared by attaching staple strands to the p8064 ssDNA circular scaffold with a 16 base-long overhang that was complementary to the handles on the shell subunits. An oligo containing a CY5 dye was also hybridized to the scaffold to enable fluorescence read-out by laser scanning of agarose gels ( Supplementary Fig. 36A , middle and Supplementary  Fig. 43C ). In order to avoid having the unbound staples in cargo solution, which would passivate the monomers, 20 different staples are mixed with the scaffolds in 1:2 ratio. To anneal staples to the circular ssDNA, FOB15 buffer is used with a temperature ramp of 65°C for 15 min, 60°C to 44°C for 1h/1°C. To encapsulate gold nanoparticles, complementary handles of the monomer's handles are attached to the gold nanoparticles with a diameter of 30 nm (Cytodiagnostics, OligoREADY Gold Nanoparticle Conjugation Kit). A schematic and a negative stain TEM tomogram slice is shown in Supplementary Fig. 36 , B and C. To increase the visibility of the encapsulated circular ssDNA in TEM images, gold nanoparticles with a diameter of 20 nm (Cytodiagnostics, OligoREADY Gold Nanoparticle Conjugation Kit) were attached to the circular ssDNA scaffold (schematic and negative stain TEM are shown in Supplementary Fig. 36 , B and C last images from the right). T=1 shells with & without cargo were assembled in 1xFoB20 buffer at 40°C for 3 days. Shell subunits were gel purified prior to assembly. Concentration of triangles was 16 nM. Concentration of cargo (of any type) was 0.8 nM.\n",
            " Nine staples on the inside of the triangles were modified with handles with 26 single-stranded bases at the 5' ends (seq.: 'GCAGTAGAGTAGGTAGAGATTAGGCAoligonucleotide', for design details see Supplementary Figs. 41,42 ). The triangles were purified and assembled as described above. Oligonucleotides complementary to the handle-sequence and modified with a thiol group at the 3' end were coupled to the anti-HBc 17H7 (100 μg) using a Sulfo SMCC (Sulfosuccinimidyl-4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) cross-linker. The product was subsequently purified using the proFIRE ® from Dynamic Biosensors. The DNA modified antibodies were added to the assembled shells and incubated over night at 25°C. HBV core particles were incubated with the modified shells for 1-4 hours at 25°C. To assemble T=1 triangles around HBV core particles, the modified antibodies were added to single triangles. These triangles were then incubated with HBV core particles at a MgCl 2 concentration of 19 mM for one day.\n",
            " The complete octahedral shells were assembled at 35 mM MgCl 2 and UV cross-linked as described in (33) for 1h at 310 nm wavelength using the Asahi Spectra Xenon Light source 300W MAX-303. The shells were incubated in a 0.6:1 ratio of N:P with a mixture of K 10 oligolysine and K 10 -PEG 5K oligolysine (1:1) for 1h at room temperature as similarly described in (34) . The octahedra were incubated in 55% mouse serum for 1h and 24h at 37°C. To allow imaging with negative stain the samples were diluted with PBS to a final mouse serum concentration of 5%, immediately before application to the negative stain grids.\n",
            " The partial shells used for virus neutralization experiments in vivo were assembled at 60 mM MgCl 2 and UV cross-linked as described in (33) for 30 min using the Asahi Spectra Xenon Light source 300W MAX-303. We introduced three-bases long sticky overhangs at every stacking contact and added one thymidine at the ends of both oligonucleotides (see Supplementary Fig. 45 ) to covalently crosslink the triangular subunits. The sticky overhangs were necessary to compensate for the decrease in blunt-end stacking induced by addition of the thymidines for UV point welding. The shells were incubated in a 0.6:1 ratio N:P with a mixture of K 10 oligolysine and K 10 -PEG 5K oligolysine (1:1) for 1h at room temperature as similarly described in (34) . The DNA modified antibodies were added to the assembled shells and incubated over night at room temperature.\n",
            " The size distribution of folding reactions or shell assemblies was investigated using agarose gel electrophoresis. For solutions including only shell subunits, we used 1.5% agarose gels containing 0.5xTBE Buffer (22.25 mM Tris Base, 22.25 mM Boric Acid, 0.5 mM EDTA) and 5.5 mM MgCl 2 . For solutions including oligomeric assemblies such as shells, an agarose concentration of 0.5% was used. The gel electrophoresis was performed in 0.5xTBE buffers supplemented with the same MgCl 2 concentration as the solutions in which the shells were incubated in. For MgCl 2 concentration larger than 15 mM, a surrounding ice-water bath was used for cooling the gel. The gel electrophoresis was performed for 1.5 to 2 hours at 90 V bias voltage. For gels with MgCl 2 concentrations larger than 15 mM, we exchanged the buffer after 45 min. The agarose gels were then scanned with a Typhoon FLA 9500 laser scanner (GE Healthcare) with a pixel size of 50 μm/pix.\n",
            " Samples were incubated on glow-discharged collodion-supported carbon-coated Cu400 TEM grids (in-house production) for 30 to 120 s depending on structure and MgCl 2 concentration. The grids were stained with 2% aqueous uranyl formate solution containing 25 mM sodium hydroxide. Imaging was performed with magnifications between 10000x to 42000x. T=3 triangles were imaged on a Phillips CM100 equipped with a AMT 4Mpx CCD camera. All other negative staining data was acquired with SerialEM at a FEI Tecnai T12 microscope operated at 120 kV with a Tietz TEMCAM-F416 camera. TEM micrographs were high-pass filtered to remove long-range staining gradients and the contrast was auto-leveled (Adobe Photoshop CS6). To obtain detailed information on individual particles and investigate successful encapsulation negative stain EM tomography was used as a visualization technique. The grids were prepared as described above, and the tilt series acquired with magnifications between 15000x and 30000x using the FEI Tecnai 120. The stage was tilted from -50° to 50° and micrographs were acquired in 2° increments.\n",
            " All tilt series were subsequently processed with Etomo (IMOD) (43) to acquire tomograms. The micrographs were aligned to each other by calculating a cross correlation of the consecutive tilt series images. The tomogram is subsequently generated using a filtered back-projection. The Gaussian-Filter used a cutoff between 0.25 and 0.5 and a fall-off of 0.035.\n",
            " The DNA origami concentrations used for preparing the cryo-EM grids are summarized in Supplementary Table 3 . Samples with concentrations higher than 100 nM were applied to glow-discharged C-flat 1.2/1.3 or 2/1 thick grids (Protochip). Samples containing shells with less than 30 nM monomer concentrations were incubated on glow-discharged grids with an ultrathin carbon film supported by a lacey carbon film on a 400-mesh copper grid (Ted Pella). The concentration of all single triangles was increased above 500 nM with PEG precipitation (31) . 1 ml of folding reaction (~50 nM monomer concentration) was mixed with 1 ml of PEG, centrifuged at 21k rcf for 25 min and re-suspended in 50 to 100 μl 1xFoB5. The DNA-origami triangles used for assembling the shells were all gel purified and concentrated with ultrafiltration as described above before increasing the MgCl 2 concentration. Plunge freezing in liquid ethane was performed with a FEI Vitrobot Mark V with a blot time of 1.5 to 2 s, a blot force of -1 and a drain time of 0 s at 22°C and 100% humidity. The samples with less than 100 nM monomer concentrations were incubated on the support layer for 60 to 90 s before blotting. All cryo-EM images were acquired with a Cs-corrected Titan Krios G2 electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Falcon III 4k direct electron detector (Thermo Fisher). We used EPU 1.2 up to 2.6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for automated single particle acquisition. See Supplementary Table 3 for microscope settings for all individual datasets. The defocus for all acquisitions was set to -2 μm. The image processing was done at first in RELION-2 (44) and then later in RELION-3 (45) . The recorded movies were subjected to MotionCor2 (46) for movie alignment and CTFFIND4.1 (47) for CTF estimation. After reference-free 2D classification the best 2D class averages, as judged by visual inspection, were selected for further processing. A subset of these particles was used to calculate an initial model. After one to two rounds of 3D classification, the classes showing the most features or completely assembled shells were selected for 3D auto-refinement and post-processing. For the corresponding shells octahedral (O) or icosahedral (I1) symmetry was used for the last two steps. All post-processed maps are deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) (see Supplementary Table 3 ).\n",
            " Various concentrations of assembled half-T1 shells were incubated overnight at room temperature with 2 nM oligonucleotide-conjugated capture antibody (anti-HBc 17H7, Isotype IgG-2b) in FoB30-T (FoB30 + 0.05% Tween-20). The next day the pre-incubated mixtures were added to 5 pM HBV core particles and incubated overnight at room temperature, yielding 1 nM capture antibody, 2.5 pM HBV core particle and 0-200 pM half-T=1 shells. A flat-bottom transparent 96 well microplate (Nunc MaxiSorp) was treated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl/well anti-IFA-HepBcore (1 μg/ml in PBS). After washing 4 times with 200 μl/well PBS-T (PBS + 0.05% Tween-20) the well surface was blocked by incubating with 200 μl/well 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing 4 times with 200 μl/well FoB30-T, 90 μl of the pre-incubated samples were added to the wells and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by washing and subsequent incubation for 1 hour with 100 μl/well horseradish peroxidase conjugated detection antibody (anti-HepBcore-HRP in FoB30-T). After washing with FoB30-T, 100 μl/well HRP substrate (3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine, lifetechnologies) was added and product formation was monitored in time by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm with a 60 s interval in a platereader pre-equilibrated to 30 °C (CLARIOstar, BMG labtech). HRP activity was calculated by fitting linear regression slopes to the linear regime of the kinetic data (typically the first 5 minutes). Virus blocking efficiency was calculated relative to a control of HBV core particles only and blank measurements where no HBV core particle was present during all the incubation and washing steps. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Antibodies used for the ELISA were kindly provided by Centro De Ingenieria Genetica y Biotecnologia de sancti spiritus in Cuba.\n",
            " Imaging was performed with negative-stained TEM grids coated with a 5 nm layer of AuPd using a Quorum Q150T sputter coater in ORION Nanofab (Zeiss). We used an acceleration voltage of 30 kV and a beam current of 0.3 to 0.4 pA. The images were acquired in scanning mode with an Everhart-Thornley 2k detector.\n",
            " Hepatitis B virus core particles of genotype D (subtype ayw2) were produced recombinantly in E. coli K802 and BL21 cells (purchased from the Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, Riga, Latvia). Briefly, particles were obtained by sonication and clarification from bacterial protein extracts and purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation and subsequent anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography as described (48) . Final preparations were constantly kept at 4 °C in the dark in conventional PBS (including 0.05% NaN 3 , 1 mM DTT).\n",
            " Anti-HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) 17H7 (Isotype IgG-2b) was produced by the Monoclonal Antibody Core Facility at Helmholtz Zentrum München in Munich (HMGU). Briefly, mouse HBc-recognizing B cells were generated by common hybridoma technology. The mice were challenged with the peptide NLEDPASRDLVVC (aa 75-86 of HBV core). Mouse hybridoma clones were selected and secreted antibodies were analyzed by immune staining and precipitation of HBcAg and ELISA for native antigen recognition and by Western Blot analysis for detection of denatured antigen. Final 17H7 preparations were purified via standard affinity chromatography using a protein A/G column and concentrated to 0.8 mg/mL (5.33 μM) of protein and kept in conventional PBS (137 mM NaCl, 10 mM Phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4) at 4 °C in the dark.\n",
            " HEK293T (human embryonic kidney cell line, DSMZ) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Gibco, cat. no. 31966047) with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. F9665). Cells were cultured routinely in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . AAV2 carrying eGFP (Biocat, cat. no. AA002-GVO-GC) were utilized for transduction experiments, where the concentration of infectious particles was determined by titration as per the manufactures protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 80,000 cells mL -1 16-24 h prior to transduction, and harvested 72 h after transduction for quantification of transduction efficiency by flow cytometry. Samples were acquired and analyzed using Attune™ NxT Flow Cytometer and software (Thermofisher) respectively. 20,000 single cell events, gated on side scatter area vs height were recorded for analysis. eGFP was excited by 488 nm laser, and emission was measured with a 530/30 nm bandpass filter. Untreated cells were used as a negative control. Concentration of infectious particles was determined to be 1.23 × 10 9 IFU mL -1 . Total number of AAV2 virus particles was measured by ELISA as per manufacture's protocol (Progen, cat. No. PRATV), and determined to be 2.24 × 10 12 VP mL -1 .\n",

Next, each of the different titration conditions were prepared and diluted to a total of 33.5 μL per condition with PBS. 4 μL of diluted AAV-2 sample (1/100, in PBS) was added and mixed, and samples were left to incubate (2 h, r.t.). Cells were washed with PBS and 62.5 μL of DMEM with 2% FBS was added to each well. Mixtures (37.5 μL) were then added dropwise to each well.

            "Title: The Importance of Glycans of Viral and Host Proteins in Enveloped Virus Infection\n",
            "Body Text: Animal viruses are parasites of animal cells that have characteristics such as heredity and replication, and are mainly composed of DNA or RNA, proteins and in some, a lipid membrane with glycoproteins (1) . Commonly, viruses achieve invasion and infection with the help of the synthetic machinery of host cells. Viruses can be divided into two groups depending on whether they have a lipid bilayer membrane on their outer surface or not: enveloped viruses and nonenveloped viruses. Enveloped viruses have a lipid bilayer that comes from the host cell. It incorporates receptor attachment proteins and membrane fusion proteins that are both encoded by the virus. And all attachment or fusion proteins of enveloped viruses are modified by glycosylation. Glycosylation is important for the life cycle of the virus and plays essential roles in stability, antigenicity and infectivity of viruses (2) . We summarize the functions of common enveloped viral glycoproteins in Table 1 .\n",
            " Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications of proteins, and there are two main types: N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation ( Figure 1 ). N-glycosylation means that Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in an oligosaccharide binds covalently to the polypeptide chain by an Nglycoside linkage with the amide nitrogen of an asparagine residue in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X is any amino acid other than proline). The main type of O-glycosylation is the mucin-type O-glycosylation, which means that N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) bonds covalently to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residues replacing the hydrogen in the hydroxyl group to form an (12) . The formation and extension of glycans requires the synergistic completion of two types of glycan processing enzymes, one is glycosyltransferase which catalyzes the formation of glycoside linkages, and another is glycosidase which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycoside linkages (13) .\n",
            " The entry of a virus into a host cell is closely related to the glycans on its own structural proteins. The glycoproteins of some viruses play an important role in host infection, especially in the recognition of the host cell and the interaction with other molecules in the cell after the attachment (14) . Furthermore, due to the fact that viruses can fully depend on cellular host cells These viral glycoprotein are classified as: (1) GP, glycoprotein; (2) HA, hemagglutinin; (3) E, enveloped proteins; (4) prM, premembrane; (5) S, spike protein.\n",
            " FIGURE 1 | Glycoconjugates that formed by carbohydrates are covalently bonded to proteins and lipids on mammalian cell membranes. Proteins can be glycosylated and covalently bound to a polypeptide chain via an N-glycoside linkage to Asn or via an O-glycoside linkage to Ser/Thr. N-linked glycans share a common pentasaccharide core structure, which is composed of two GlcNAc and three mannoses. The main type of O-linked glycosylation is the mucin-type Oglycosylation, which has N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) as a common core. Glycosphingolipids are ubiquitous molecules that formed via the covalent linkage between a glycan moiety and a ceramide.\n",
            " for their reproduction, thus, they must complete glycosylation with the help of host glycoprotein synthesis mechanism (1, 15) . Viral glycoproteins are involved in many important biological processes, such as protein folding and stabilization, viral infection and invasion, recognition of host receptors and immune escape of the virus from the immune system (16) .\n",
            " With the development of glycan-related research technology, the research and development of novel virus vaccines and antiviral drugs modified by glycosylation are receiving increasing attention. In this review, we will explore the effects of glycosylation of host and virus proteins on virus biological behavior, with the aim of providing a reference for the prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases.\n",
            " The life cycle of enveloped viruses includes the processes of adsorption, penetration, uncoating, biosynthesis, assembly and release. Figure 2 summarizes the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.\n",
            " Viral replication depends on successful infection of the host cells. The replication cycle starts with a virus particle attaching to a specific receptor on the surface of a host cell, and viral entry can be realized by endocytosis (non-enveloped or enveloped viruses), membrane fusion (enveloped viruses) or direct fusion with the plasma membrane (20, 21) . After internalization, the capsid is released into the cytoplasm with negative strand viruses, it is uncoating the nucleocapsid, which will be copied to produce the antigenome which itself is then used to transcribe many copies of the genome, or mRNA that are translated into viral proteins (17, 18) . The viral glycopeptides are translated on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where the N-linked glycans are added and transported through the Golgi complex where the N-linked glycans are modified and the O-glycans are added (22, 23) . At the same time, the viral genome with its associated proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus, where they are released outside the cell by exocytosis after maturation (24) . Glycoproteins are essential for the infectivity of the virions that have them.\n",
            " The glycoproteins in the membrane of enveloped viruses bind specifically to the receptors on the cell membrane and cause membrane fusion enabling virus contents to enter the cell. In this process, the surface glycans of the virus can be involved in initiating the recognition of host cells and thus affect the organs and the cells that in the organs. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is an enveloped virus, and its envelope contains of gp120 surface protein and gp41 transmembrane protein. Moreover, gp120 is one of the most highly glycosylated proteins in nature. It accounts for approximately 50% of the total mass (25) . These glycans not only affect the conformation of the envelope but also affect the entry and infectivity of the virus. It is generally believed that HIV-1 gp120 promotes viral entry by sequentially binding to CD4 and chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 on target cells (26) . However, there have been many reports that gp120 can bind to various cell types independently of CD4. Some HIV-1 isolates were able to infect CD4-negative but CCR5 expressing cells due to the deficiency of Asn 197 in gp120, which leads to the exposure of the CCR5-binding region of gp120, thus HIV-1 can enter cells (27) . Similarly, the binding of virus to CD4 was reduced significantly by removing the glycan chains from gp120 by endoglycosidase treatment or Nglycosylation site mutation (28, 29) . In contrast, in Vero cells, removing the N-glycan near the highly conserved receptor binding domain on the envelope glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus (EBOV) increased GP-mediated virus entry efficiency (30) . Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the surface glycoproteins of influenza A virus. Influenza virus attaches to the surface of a host cell when its HA protein interacts with the terminal sialic acid (SA) of the host cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids. On the other hand, NA can cleave SA residues from glycoproteins of the enveloped virus itself and enhance infectivity by preventing aggregation of virus particles (31) . NA may also act on the SA residues of host mucin to gain access to the epithelial cells, playing a secondary role in helping viruses to enter host cells (32) .\n",
            " One of the key roles of protein glycosylation is its effect on folding, structure, transport, and stability (33) . Glycans can be structurally integrated into protein folding, and the interaction between the glycan and protein could stabilize the protein. Besides, glycans can also assist glycoprotein folding in the biosynthetic process by mediating interactions with chaperones (34) . Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) act as chaperones to facilitate the correct folding of viral proteins. In cells, when all nascent N-glycans added to a protein, they have three terminal glucose residues. These residues will be removed sequentially, with a -glucosidase I (aGI) removing the outermost glucose residue and a-glucosidase II (aGII) removing the next two residues produce the immature GlcMan9GlcNAc2 N-glycans (35) . CNX and CRT have a lectin domain, and this domain can specifically bind to immature GlcMan 9 GlcNAc 2 N-glycans on misfolded proteins and recruit ATP, calcium, and protein disulfide isomerase A3 to promote the folding of glycoproteins, thereby regulating glycoprotein entry into the CNX/CRT folding cycle (36, 37) .\n",
            " Glycans on enveloped virus surface proteins can not only facilitate the folding of proteins but can also affect their transport. During HIV-1 replication, a high mannose type gp160 trimer assembles in the rough ER of host cells, and then gp160 is transported to the Golgi apparatus and cleaved by a furinlike protease in the late Golgi to its mature gp120 and gp41 proteins which remain associated (38, 39) . HIV-1 gp41 contains four N-glycosylation sites, removing of Asn 332 in gp41 can disrupt the proteolytic processing and the transportation of gpl60 (40, 41) . Herpes simplex viruses 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex viruses 2 (HSV-2) are globally prevalent pathogens, which often lead to recurrent oral and genital ulcers (42) . HSV encodes at least 12 different glycoproteins, and at least four of them are necessary and sufficient to mediate membrane fusion when they infect target cells, namely glycoprotein B (gB), gD, gH and gL (43) (44) (45) . Similarly, mutations of N390, N483 or N668 in total seven potential N-glycosylation sites on gB of HSV-2 can reduce the ability of cell-cell fusion and virus entry. However, the mutation of N133 mainly prevents the transport of gB from the ER to the Golgi, thus affecting protein expression and the production of infectious virions (46) .\n",
            " Enveloped viruses mainly release their progeny by budding. Their envelope is derived from the host cell membrane, and the glycan on viral proteins can affect the release of progeny virions. For example, gC of HSV-1 mediates the attachment of HSV-1 to susceptible host cells by interacting with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) on the cell surface. Also, gC contains a mucin-like domain (MLD) located near the GAG binding site, which may affect the binding activity between the virus and GAG. HSV-1 mutants that lack these MLDs in gC and found that compared with natural HSV-1, the binding affinity of virions to the cell was reduced and the release ability of mutant virus particles from the surface of infected cells was also reduced (47) . Similarly, glycosylation sites on the premembrane protein and enveloped proteins of West Nile virus (WNV) are cell typedependent or even species-dependent and affect the release of virus and infection efficiency (10) .\n",
            " Moreover, some viruses have even evolved glycosidases to promote virus release (48) . The most obvious example is that influenza virus NA cleaves SA residues from the surface of host cells, thereby reducing and weakening the ability of HA to bind to host cell glycoprotein receptors (49, 50) . During the process of virus budding from the cell plasma membrane, HA proteins continue to bind virions to SA residues on the cell surface until the NA sialidase activity removes terminal SA residues.\n",
            " During the process of viral evolution, viruses develop different glycosylation modifications, and N-glycosylation sites of proteins are added or deleted, these alterations can have an appreciable impact on the survival and transmissibility of a virus (16) . For example, adding an N-glycosylation site to the HA protein can increase the sensitivity of the respiratory system to innate immune protein production, and reduce the transmissibility of influenza A viruses (51) (52) (53) . Similarly, N-glycan of HIV gp120 is also of vital importance to viral infection and transmission (54) . The majority of HIV N-glycan deficient mutants show decreased infectivity and transmission efficiency (N156Q, N197Q, N332Q, N386Q), but two of the N-glycan mutants (N230Q and N295Q) show increased infectivity and transmission efficiency (54) . SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing a health crisis, the magnitude of which is rare in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 virus spike (S) glycoprotein is highly glycosylated, if the glycosylation sites of both N331 and N343 are mutated at the same time, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 can be significantly reduced, suggesting that their glycans are important for viral infectivity (55) .\n",
            " In addition, replication of the same virus in different cells can generate different glycosylation, which severely affects the transmission ability of the virus (56) . For example, HIV from different cell lines has different glycosylation in its envelope proteins, and the glycosylation difference affects its interaction with Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). HIV from T cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells was well bound and transmitted by DC-SIGN, whereas HIV from macrophages was poorly bound and transmitted (57, 58) .\n",
            " Enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1, influenza virus, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 are a great threat to humans. The envelope proteins of these viruses are heavily glycosylated, and these glycans can hide an antigenic epitope to thereby avoiding recognition by neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against that site and providing a convenient way for viruses to infect host cells and to promote immune escape. There are two main mechanisms by which viruses can escape the nAbs response.\n",
            " Despite major efforts to produce a vaccine for HIV-1, it is unfortunate that all of the traditional methods of vaccine preparation have generated little expected effect due to the great diversity of HIV-1 strains (59) . Only a minority of people produce nAbs after receiving HIV vaccines. Mutation of Asn 332 in gp120 after HIV infection and also nAbs that target this site were detected in the sera from two people who had responded to an HIV vaccine (a recombinant glycoprotein 120 vaccine), suggesting that HIV antigenic sites are blocked by glycans, resulting in most people failing to produce broadly nAbs (60) . Similarly, patients with acute HIV infection do not produce detectable nAbs until at least 52 days after infection. Hardly any mutations were detected in the envelope proteins of the viruses that successfully escaped after nAbs suppression, while an increase in N-glycosylation was detected (61) . Moreover, one of the two N-glycosylation sites of Ebola virus GP2 is mutated, which is very adverse to the antigenicity and immunogenicity of GP (62) . All of these observations illustrate that highly glycosylated modifications can shield the antigenic sites of the virus and present challenges to antiviral therapy.\n",
            " Antigenic drift is a small variation in antigens caused by mutations in the genome, without new subtypes generation, but it often promotes immune escape and leads to the greater scope of the spreading, which often occurs in influenza viruses. H1N1 broke out in 1918/1919, infecting nearly half of the world's population, with a mortality rate of 2.5%~5%, at least 50 million people died (63) . Ninety-one years later, in April 2009, the new H1N1 virus appeared and spread rapidly around the world, causing an estimated 280,000 deaths worldwide. Low immunity of the population to the novel H1N1 strain was the main reason that led to its mass epidemic. HA is an effective target for nAbs, and mutations in the antigenic sites in its globular head region promote the immune escape of the virus. A complete analysis of the amino acid sequence of the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses showed that the HA of these viruses can be glycosylated at the conserved glycosylation sites (64, 65) . It was reported that highly glycosylated seasonal Influenza A viruses are inactivated by soluble lectins of the innate immune system (66) . Compared with seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses, the HA globular regions of epidemic H1N1 are often modified by a low degree of glycosylation, which correlates with a greater difference at the amino acid level seen at or near the known antigenic sites located in the globular head of the HA (67, 68) . Furthermore, that only influenza (H1N1) shows antigenic drift compared to several other RNA viruses that infect the respiratory tract (69) . These antigenic drifts contribute to the immune escape of H1N1, contributing in part to the flu vaccine failing to provide protection (70) .\n",
            " There are many glycans in virus surface glycoproteins, and they affect the virulence of the virus by regulating the binding of the virus to host receptors, covering up antigenic sites, or stimulating host immune responses to affect virulence (71) . These glycans play different roles in the virulence of the virus.\n",
            " Rabies viruses (RABVs) are non-segmented, negativestranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae. The RABV genome encodes five structural proteins: nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, GP, and large transcriptase protein (9) . GP is the only viral transmembrane protein that is exposed on the virion surface that interacts and the target cell receptor. The GP of most RABVs has two N-glycosylation sites, Asn 37 and Asn 319 . The N-glycan at Asn 37 plays a role in promoting the propagation of the virus but also reduces the pathogenicity of the virus (53) . Similarly, the addition of a single N-glycan at Asn 194 or Asn 247 also reduced the pathogenicity of street rabies viruses, confirmed by peripheral infection in mice (72) . Furthermore, the virulence of H1N1 for mice decreased with an increase in the number of HA glycosylation sites (64) .\n",
            " On the other hand, the glycans of viral proteins can also enhance their virulence. For example, glycosylated and nonglycosylated E proteins of WNV are neurovirulent. However, viruses containing glycosylated E proteins are more neuroinvasive in BALB/c mice (73) . Otherwise, the adding N-glycosylation of amino acids at either 154 or 156 increase neuro-invasiveness in mice, avian virulence, and vector competence (74) .\n",
            " The specific binding of a virus to host receptor is a prerequisite for viral infection, and the viral glycans responsible for attachment and cell receptors of viruses play a decisive role. Many studies have focused on the functions of glycans on the viral protein: such as host cell recognition, replication, infection and immune escape. However, hosts and viruses have coevolutionary relationships, thus the functions of host receptors are also crucial, and all viruses must interact with the specific receptors when they enter a cell. The specificity of host receptors is considered to be one of the major factors in determining host range and tissue tropism. Host receptor refers to a component of the host cell membrane that can bind specifically to the virus, mediate virus entry, and promote virus infection. Its chemical nature is a glycoprotein, proteoglycan, lipid, or glycolipid (75, 76) . According to their different functions, virus receptors can be divided into two categories: attachment factors and entry receptors (77) . Entry receptors can bind to the virus and mediate the internalization of the virus, for example, HIV can bind to CD4. Attachment factors concentrate viruses on the cell surface and play an auxiliary role in the process of virus infection (78) . For example, heparin sulfate, which is proteoglycan widely found on various cell surfaces and extracellular matrix in the body, can act as an auxiliary receptor of SARS-CoV-2 to promote the entry of virus (79) . Therefore, glycans on a host cell receptor can play an important role in influencing viral infection as a functional receptor or attachment factor for the virus.\n",
            " SA is a naturally existing nine-carbon monosaccharide and has been identified as a functional receptor attached to the termini of N-glycans or O-glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids (80) . SA is one of the first sites for the contact between many pathogens and hosts because it presents on the outer surface of cells and mucosal tissues. SA carried by most mammals is called Nglycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) ( Figure 3A) ; however, our ancestors also evolved another kind of SA, called Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), probably to resist the malaria parasite that was able to use Neu5Gc to enter the human body at that time. After completing this evolution, making some diseases seem more particularly specific to humans, such as typhoid, cholera, mumps, pertussis, asthma, and coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) (81) . When SARS-CoV-2 enters the human body, it recognizes SA first, and search for its receptor at the same time, then it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), opening the access into the cell (82, 83) .\n",
            " Usually, SA exists as a bound sugar at the terminal positions of glycans via different glycosidic linkages (a2,3, a2,6, and a2,8) . Figure 3B shows common SA linkage types. SA can be found in almost all animals, but the virus cannot infect all animals that have SA. Besides, different viruses infect different hosts by employing different receptors, which may be determined by the diversification of SA residue linkage types ( Figure 3B) , that is, viruses have a specific selectivity in the process of infecting the host. For example, the influenza virus binds to the receptor by recognizing SA residue at the terminal position of the receptor glycoprotein glycan chain, but it has the preference for certain types of SA (such as Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac). The preferential binding property may be attributed to the changes in the penultimate galactose residue linkage to SA. Avian influenza virus mainly binds to a2,3-linked SA residue, while human influenza virus preferentially binds to a2,6-linked SA residue (84, 85) .\n",
            " Other glycans can also act as viral receptors to influence the entry of viruses, such as heparan sulfate, which can act as an initial adhesion receptors for various viruses, so it can help the virus adhere to the cells and mediate entry before the virus binds to the high-affinity receptors. HSV entry begins with the attachment of the virus to target cells through binding of HSV gC and/or gB to heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 or syndecan-2 of the epithelial cell surface. Then, via various cell surface receptors such as nectin-1 or nectin-2. Finally, the attached virus begins to enter the cells (86) (87) (88) . Like HSV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters cells by interacting with syndecan-1 or syndecan-4 on the surface of human hepatocytes to initiate its life cycle (89, 90) . As for HCV, its functional receptors include SRB1, CD81, CLDN1, and OCLN, among which CD81 is the most important (91) .\n",
            " Also, neutral glycans may act as virus receptors, such as histo-blood group antigens, which are present in red blood cells, epithelial cells, and mucosal secretions, and play an important role as attachment factors for Rotavirus and Norovirus (92, 93) .\n",
            " Faced with the threat of new viruses, the effective prevention measure that we can take is to control the source of infection, cut off the main route of transmission and protect the susceptible population, these measures will be essential to bring the situation under control and to alleviate the negative effects of the epidemic. The definitive solution is effective vaccines that induce uninfected people to generate protective antibody and build long-term immune memory to combat the virus if the vaccine ever comes in contact with that virus at a later time.\n",
            " Although we know that the envelope proteins in HIV are the only target for nAbs (94) , it is unfortunate that almost all of the traditional methods of vaccine preparation have generated little expected effect due to the great diversity of HIV-1 strains. Removal of the N-glycan modifications in the highly variable V1-V3 region of HIV-1 envelope protein improves the sensitivity of the virus to nAbs (95) . Similarly, the gp120 complex mutated at the glycosylation site N448E can activate antiviral immunity better than the gp120 wild type. This suggests that removing N-glycans can increase the effectiveness of HIV vaccine (3). However, the heterogeneity of the HIV envelope, viruses tend to escape from most neutralizing antibody responses. Currently, HIV vaccine development research is focused on inducing unique broadly nAbs to act on diverse strains of HIV-1.\n",
            " Because of the antigenic drift of influenza viruses, current influenza vaccines need to be updated annually. The number and length of glycans on HA can affect the immune response; reducing the length of glycans can induce nAbs to make a stronger immune response to antigenic epitopes (96) . The binding of nAbs to the HA glycans was inhibited at low temperature because the low temperature can stiffen the glycan structure (97) . Interestingly, increased density of viral glycans in oligosaccharide-modified influenza viruses can directly activate the immune response and there exists a class of conserved epitopes in influenza viruses, that after adding hyperglycosylated artificially will become dominant (It was verified by mice in vivo experiment) (98) . This finding suggests that further study on glycosylation of influenza virus HA protein can be helpful to develop antiviral drugs.\n",
            " Experimental vaccines against HSV-1 target particular viral glycoproteins. HSV envelope gD is expressed on the surface of the virus and induces a nAbs response. The largest current clinical trial of HSV subunit vaccines has found an inhibitory effect on HSV-1, but no effect against HSV-2 (99). A different attenuated vaccine strategy has been attempted by using HSV without glycoprotein D2, this vaccine can induce neutralizing antibody which displays antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity to achieve better protection from HSV infection (100, 101) .\n",
            " The GP of EBOV is the main target of nAbs. Most of the current research on Ebola vaccines uses GP as the immunogen. Mature GP is composed of GP1 and GP2. They are presented on the surface of virions as trimers of disulfide-linked GP1-GP2 heterodimers. The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap, and the MLD. The MLD is highly variable and contains both N-and O-linked glycans (30) . The MLD is essential for immune shielding, studies have shown that the MLD-deleted GP1 and GP2 can induce an immune response that may result in cross-species immunity (102) . Similarly, a subunit vaccine that contains the extracellular domain of the GP fused with the Fc fragment of human IgG1 to protect mice against EBOV lethal challenge (103). Further research found that mutation of Asn 565 on GP2 was highly detrimental to the immunogenicity of GP; However, mutation of two N-glycosylation sites on GP1 (388, 415 sites) may enhance immunogenicity (62) . Hence, the glycan on EBOV GP play an important role in inducing immunity, and further study of glycan may help us develop more effective vaccines.\n",
            " The S protein is the only antigen that is target of nAbs. The RNA vaccine that expecting S protein now aims to use all over the world. The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly glycosylated with 22 N-glycosylation sites (104) . However, in the face of mutant virus strains, existing vaccines are less effective (105, 106) . Deletion of the N331 and N343 glycosylation sites of SARS-CoV-2 S protein could significantly reduce the ability of the virus to infect, and mutations of N234Q and N165Q could markedly resist to nAbs and be more sensitive, respectively (55) . The functional study of different glycosylation sites on S protein may provide references for the development of effective vaccines and drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in the future.\n",
            " Glycans can affect the host cell recognition, replication, infection and immune escape of virus. With the deepening understanding of the structure and function of enveloped virus glycoproteins, research and development of antibody drugs that target enveloped virus glycoproteins have become a current hot topic (94) . Studies have shown that lectins can inhibit HIV-1 infection by binding directly to the viral glycans, thereby disrupting the receptor-induced conformational changes, inhibiting membrane fusion, and blocking the binding of DC-SIGN (107) (108) (109) . In addition, tetherin is a protein molecule on the surface of human cells that can block the spread of HIV and inhibit the release of a broad-spectrum of enveloped viruses by retaining virions on the surface of the infected cell. It has been reported that the antiviral activity of tetherin is related to its glycosylation. Human tetherin contains two putative N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn 65 and Asn 92 ), and glycosylation of at least one Asn of tetherin is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of HIV-1 release (110) . The use of mannosidase-I inhibitor such as kifunensine inhibits the biosynthesis of Nglycan and enhances proteolysis of S proteins, which reduces receptor-binding domain presentation on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, lowers the binding to host ACE2 and decrease viral entry (111) . In addition, other N-glycosylation inhibitors, like swainsonine, which is mannosidase II inhibitor and has been shown to be safe in humans, can cause N-glycan truncation may be used to reduce viral entry (112) . Iminosugars are known inhibitors of aGI and aGII, like celgosivir, castanospermine, and UV-4, which can effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture (113) . These drugs and compounds may be used to reduce viral load and moderate SARS-CoV-2 related respiratory symptoms.\n",
            " Other potential inhibitors that may modulate viral entry include carbohydrate-based small molecules (e.g. 4F-GlcNAC, 4F-GalNAC) and acceptor decoys (e.g. ONAP, SNAP) are used by interfering with the mutual recognition process of glycan and lectin (114) .\n",
            " Historically, viral diseases have repeatedly caused large-scale global public health concerns and threats to human health and survival. Figure 4 illustrates the transmission pathway of several common viruses that infect humans. Increasing evidence shows that the alterations in the N-glycan profile and sugar recognition pattern in host cells can reflect the progress of viral infection to some extent and are expected to be a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of viral infection (116) . In short, glycosylation can be a tool for the virus to infect the host and escape host immunity. Here, we have summarized the progress in studying the effects of glycan on viral behavior in recent decades, which will provide new insights for the development of viral vaccines and help to develop new targets to protect against these viruses. Finally, faced with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we need to identify the key therapeutic targets including glycosylation sites in vaccines and drug targets. With the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, although we have effective countermeasures, the mutated version of the virus still threatens the health safety of mankind. In general, the existing vaccines are still effective against the mutated virus, but the neutralization efficiency is lower (106) . How to develop a more effective vaccine has become an urgent task at present. As one of the most important post-translational modifications, glycosylation is an indispensable factor in virus function. Glycosylation inhibitors can significantly inhibit viral infection and reduce the synthesis of viral proteins (117) . We need to design a new vaccine virus by researching the glycosylation sites that have an impact on the viability of the virus, and modifying the glycosylation of the virus (118) . Similarly, it is also very important to study SARS-CoV-2 S glycans differ from typical host glycan processing and develop targeted glycosylation inhibitors. In addition, the use of this inhibitor in combination with other types of antiviral drugs may have a better effect in combating viral infection, replication and overcoming viral resistance (119).\n",

            "Title: Viral nanomechanics with a virtual atomic force microscope\n",
            "Body Text: Viruses are captivating nanoscale biological entities that in their simplest form are made by two essential components: a protein shell, also known as a capsid, and RNA or DNA as genetic material [1] . Despite this apparent simplicity, viruses are extremely efficient nanomachines capable of replicating with unparalleled efficiency in a wide variety of hosts and conditions. The most important role of the capsid is to protect the genetic material of the virus. During the extracellular phase viruses face large variations in environmental conditions that could induce extreme changes in temperature, pH, osmotic shocks related to a sudden alteration of salt concentration, or dehydration. In addition, the capsid of many double-stranded DNA viruses has to withstand up to tens of atmospheres of pressure built up during the packaging of the viral genome at high densities [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Moreover, extremophile viruses can live in extreme conditions of salinity, radiation or temperature [8] . Thus, it is very important that the capsid keeps its integrity under environmental changes and survives mechanical stresses during its life cycle. As a consequence viruses have developed amazing mechanical properties. Notable examples are bacteriophage φ29 that is capable of withstanding about 50 atms of pressure inside [5, 7, 9] ; or cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) that tolerates broad pH ranges and deformations of more than 30% without breaking [10, 11] .\n",
            " In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in characterizing the mechanical properties of individual viruses [12] . These studies have been possible by the development and application of different single-molecule experimental techniques. In particular, optical tweezers have been crucial in measuring the forces associated to the packing of the genome [7] . But, arguably, the most important and popular tool has been the application of the atomic force microscope (AFM) to obtain the mechanical resistance and topography of individual capsids [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . AFM nanoindentation experiments have determined different mechanical properties of viruses, including effective Young's modulus [13] , breaking patterns and forces [18] , fatigue [19] or even internal pressures [9] .\n",
            " AFM experiments are a very powerful tool to access mechanical information of viral capsids, but it is often very hard to get a good interpretation of the results and to relate this information to the biological characteristics of viruses. In this context, theor etical modeling and simulations are required to achieve a better understanding of experimental AFM results [20] .\n",
            " The goal of this article is precisely to introduce a 'Virtual AFM', i.e. a coarse-grained simulation mimicking the standard setup and experimental protocol of AFM nanoindentation experiments. Instead of placing the focus on the finest structural details of the nanoindentation of a specific virus, the aim is to provide a highly coarse-grained description, allowing to simulate large viruses at realistic timescales and with the advantage of being able to link the mechanical behavior to the essential physical ingredients of the interaction between capsid's structural units. With the VAFM one can get a better understanding of the mechanical response of viral capsids and how it will be influenced by changes in structure, loading or environmental conditions. This article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes the basics of AFM nanoindentation experiments in the study of viral capsids. Section 3 will be devoted to the description and implementation of the 'Virtual AFM', a Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulation mimicking the typical set up of single virus nanoindentation experiments. A detailed explanation of the main parameters of the interactions in the coarse-grained model and how they could be obtained from experiments and full-atom simulations is also provided. Next, we will show how the elastic response of viruses depends on different physical parameters of their effective interactions, including the bending rigidity of the shell, the adsorption to the substrate, the radius of the AFM tip or the capsid shape. Finally, our main findings are summarized in the conclusions.\n",
            " The application of AFM has become a revolution in the study of the mechanical properties of viruses [15] . The AFM is a highresolution imaging technique that allows an exquisite control of the height, position, and force in the study of individual viruses. With it, it is possible to acquire nanometric-resolution images, and also to perform a physical characterization of the rigidity of the sample. AFM can also be used in liquids, thus facilitating the study of biological samples in their natural environment.\n",
            " AFM nanoindentation experiments are providing important information about the mechanical properties of viruses [12, 14, 16] . The use of this method on different viruses has revealed that they are mechanically robust structures with interesting elastic properties. As an example, bacteriophages have been found to have high effective Young's modulus, comparable to that of hard plastics [13] . The AFM is also being very helpful in order to infer the influence of the genetic material or other types of cargo [21] on the mechanical resistance and stability of capsids. Nanoindentation experiments comparing empty and full capsids have been performed on various viruses such as CCMV [10] , Minute Virus of Mice [22] , phages λ [23] and φ29 [9] , adenovirus [24] or herpes simplex virus [25, 26] . In addition, the mechanical changes induced by the maturation process in viruses such as moloney murine leukemia virus [27] , human immunodeficiency virus [28] , HK97 [29] or T7 [30] have also been studied.\n",
            " The basic set up of an AFM consists of a flat horizontal surface, that supports the sample and a small tip at the end of a cantilever which interacts with the sample. The position of the tip is controlled using a piezolectric device that can move the sample in all three directions by an applied electric voltage. In contact operation mode, when the tip touches the sample the cantilever suffers a deflection that is measured by a laser and a photodiode. From the deflection of the cantilever, one can get an accurate topographic image of the sample with nanometer resolution [15, 17] . The deflection can also be translated into a force with a resolution of about 10 pN, using the elastic constant of the cantilever, which can be determined using, for instance, Sader's method [31] .\n",
            " In a typical nanoindentation experiment, the sample is immobilized on a flat hard substrate. The cantilever is then lowered progressively, recording the force and deflection as a function of the vertical position of the tip [15] . A conventional experimental force curve as a function of the indentation is plotted in figure 1 . For small indentations a linear forceresponse can be observed allowing the determination of the particle's effective spring constant from the slope. For larger indentations one can observe a non-linear behavior followed by the presence of strong discontinuities in the force-indentation curve that are often attributed to the mechanical failure of the capsid. The maximum indentation is the value of the indentation at which the first sudden drop in the force occurs, and the corresponding value of the force is identified with the 'breaking force'. These three parameters, namely the effective spring constant, the maximum indentation and the breaking force, are the standard output of nanoindentation experiments. But the challenge is to translate these simple measures into meaningful intrinsic mechanical properties and to identify what are the actual processes responsible for the different features observed in the force-indentation curves.\n",
            " The mechanical information obtained by AFM experiments has traditionally been interpreted in the framework of continuum elasticity theory [32] . In the thin shell approx imation [13, 17, 33] , the elastic response of viral capsids depends on the competition between stretching and bending deformations and on the strength of the applied force (or depth of the applied indentation). One can distinguish two deformation regimes, corresponding to small and large indentation forces.\n",
            " For small deformations the behavior of the force versus indentation is linear and reversible. In these conditions, the mechanical behavior of the cantilever can be approximated as an ideal spring whose elasticity is described by Hooke's law:\n",
            " where F is the restoring force, which is equal to the force of tip-sample interaction, k c is the spring constant of the cantilever, and x is its deflection. The deformable sample can be considered like a spring in series with the cantilever. Using this approximation the effective elastic constant of the capsid is given by k cap = k c Sg Sv−Sg , where S g (nm V −1 ) is the slope of the cantilever deflection on the non-deformable substrate and S v (nm V −1 ) the slope of the cantilever deflection on the virus. Thus, in the small deformations regime, k cap is calculated from a linear fit of the force versus indentation curve. The spring constant of the virus k cap is related to the effective 3D Young's modulus E as [17, 34] :\n",
            " where μ is the Poisson's ratio, R is the radius of the capsid, and h its thickness. The previous relation is exact for a thin spherical shell indented by a point force. For a thick shell, the same formula is used, replacing the prefactor\n",
            " by an effective coefficient which in most cases is close to 1. Alternatively, the spring constant can be rewritten in terms of the 2D Young's modulus Y = Eh and the bending rigidity κ as [17, 35] \n",
            " For indentations δ larger than the shell thickness, inverse buckling occurs [35] . In this regime, the force is no longer linear, but rather goes as F ≈ √ δ. Inverse buckling is expected to happen when δ > h and when the force exceeds a critical value F inv ≈ κ/R. Applying even larger deformations eventually causes irreversible changes in the shell structure associated to bond ruptures.\n",
            " Some of the approximations involved in thin shell theory can be removed by the use of finite elements (FE) simulations to solve the complex 3D continuum elasticity equations [10, 13, 36] . Using FE, it has been possible to analyze the effect of the thickness of the capsid, to extract phenomenologically the effective Young's modulus, and even to account for the effect of inhomogeneities using refined meshes constructed from atomic maps of viruses [37] .\n",
            " The continuum mechanics description works well as a first approximation and has provided very useful information about the elastic properties of viruses. However, a continuum description cannot capture the discrete nature of subunits forming the capsid, which is very important for a correct mechanical description of viruses [38] . As an example, AFM experiments on bacteriophage T7 show an anisotropic stiffness in its mechanical response [30] that cannot be described with a continuum theory. Therefore, accounting for the discrete and inhomogeneous nature of the capsid is crucial to properly understand its stability and mechanical response.\n",
            " Different types of simulations, accounting for the discreteness of the capsid at diverse resolution levels, have been implemented in the literature. In particular, elastic network models have been used to study the buckling and deformation of viruses [35, 39, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] , but cannot easily account for breaking events. On the opposite extreme, full-atom or high-resolution, structure-based coarse-grained simulations of nanoindentation experiments are computationally very costly, specially when applied to large viruses [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . That is the reason why we developed our 'Virtual AFM' described in the next section. Using a high level of coarse-graining one can reach longer timescales and perform efficient simulations while retaining the essential ingredients of the interaction between viral capsid subunits. Our model can be considered as an intermediate approach between continuum descriptions, that ignore the discrete nature of viral capsid proteins and cannot describe virus breaking, and structure-based coarse-grained simulations. Our goal is to provide a physical interpretation of viral mechanics at a discrete level, rather than aiming at capturing all the structural details involved in the deformation of a specific virus.\n",
            " With the VAFM one can visualize the dynamics of the capsid during the nanoindentation and correlate the features observed in the force-indentation curves with actual physical changes in the capsid. The model can be used to study the mechanical properties of viruses of arbitrarily large T-number and viruses whose structure is not known with atomic resolution, thus being potentially very useful to get information on the stability and resistance of any virus.\n",
            " In order to reproduce nanoindentation experiments, we wanted to implement a simulation mimicking the typical AFM setup.\n",
            " Since we are interested in the response of the viral capsid and the dynamics of capsomers during the indentation process, we decided to use an algorithm based on BD simulations together with a coarse-grained model of a capsid that succesfully reproduces the structure and assembly of the lowest Caspar and Klug structures, as described in [53] . The model was specifically designed to study self-assembly, where a large number of capsomers and long time scales are required. At those conditions, the implementation of high-resolution coarse-grained models will be computationally very costly.\n",
            " Viral self-assembly is a complicated and virus-specific process, which however shows some universal features. The most remarkable one is that, despite the differences in shape, size, sequence and conformation of coat proteins among different viruses, they end up adopting a common set of architectures.\n",
            " That suggests the existence of common traits in the effective interactions that underlay and justify the ubiquitous prevalence of icosahedral structures [54] . In icosahedral viruses, the viral coat proteins are distributed in morphological units, called capsomers, made of five ('pentamers') or six ('hexamers') proteins.\n",
            " Although the interactions between individual proteins are presumably very complex, the effective capsomer-capsomer interactions are expected to be simpler and more isotropic. Accordingly, our model [53] is coarse-grained at the level of capsomers, i.e. pentamers and hexamers, which are the basic structural units of a viral shell. These capsomers are represented as effective spheres of two different diameters: σ h and σ p , reflecting the fact that hexamers and pentamers are made of a different number of proteins (six and five, respectively), see figure 2 (a). The goal is thus not to provide structurally-detailed information of each individual coat protein but rather to capture the essential physical traits of the effective interactions between capsid's morphological units. Three are the essential ingredients of the interactions required for a successful model of a capsid at this high level of coarse-graining. First, a short range repulsion is needed to mimic steric effects and prevent capsomer overlapping. Second, some kind of binding attraction is vital to keep the integrity of the capsid. Third, an orientational-dependent interaction is necessary to account for the anisotropy of capsomers and to form stable shell-structures rather than compact clusters. Accordingly, the interaction between capsomers is modeled using three contributions: a Mie-like, an angular, and a torsion potential, V = V LJ · V a · V tor . The Mie-like potential describes the binding and the excluded volume interaction between a pair of capsomers in terms of their relative distance, r ij . The expression used was\n",
            " where σ ij is the equilibrium distance corresponding to the minimum of the potential, r is the distance between capsomer Representation of a coarse-grained hexamer (green) and pentamer (red) used in the model, indicating the distance between their centers r ij (orange), the orientation vectors Ω i (violet) and Ω j (blue) and the angles used in the interaction potential. A white sphere is overlapped on each capsomer just for representation purpuses, to indicate its orientation.\n",
            " centers, ij is the binding energy between capsomers, and m and n represent the power of the repulsive and attractive interaction terms, respectively, which set the range of the interaction potential. The angular term of the potential is given by\n",
            " where θ ij is the angle between the vector Ω i , describing the spatial orientation of the capsomer, and the vector r ij (see figure 2 (b)). The parameter ν is the preferred angle of interaction between proteins of different capsomers, which ultimately defines the size of the shell, and the parameter α controls the local bending stiffness, i.e. the energy cost required to bend two capsomers out of their preferred angle of interaction.\n",
            " Finally, the last contribution to the potential is a torsion term included to account for the differences between the inner and outer surface of coat proteins, and to favor the formation of closed shells instead of connected surfaces with different concavity. This contribution is given by\n",
            " where k t is the torsion constant and ξ is the angle between the planes defined by vector r ij and both orientation vectors (see figure 2 (b)). The model has been implemented in a BD simulation code using reduced units and a simple stochastic Euler's integration algorithm. In the standard version of this algorithm, the position of a particle at a time t + dt is given by\n",
            " where η is the friction coefficient, D is the diffusion coefficient, F i (t) is the force on particle i, and ξ is a Gausssian distributed random number with zero mean and variance 1. For simplicity, we will use reduced units, normalizing all variables in terms of the diameter of hexamers σ ≡ σ h , the diffusion coefficient of hexamers D, and the binding energy between hexamers 0 ≡ hh . In these reduced units, the characteristic time is τ = σ 2 /D, and using Stokes-Einstein equation D = kBT η to eliminate η, Euler's algorithm can be written in a simple way. More specifically, at time t + dt , the positions r(t) and angles (θ(t) and φ(t)) for each capsomer are given by\n",
            " where T is the temperature in reduced units, dt is the time step (typically dt = 10 −5 ), ξ r , ξ θ , and ξ φ are Gaussian distributed random numbers with zero mean a variance 1. The translational and orientational forces F r (t), F θ (t) and F φ (t) are calculated from the interaction potential between capsomers. Further details and the explicit expressions of the forces can be found in [55] . It is worth emphasizing that the model can reproduce successfully the structure and assembly of the lowest T-number viral shells without requiring any additional constraints, templates or local rules. Finally, a nice characteristic of the model is that the interaction parameters can be connected to elastic modulus in the continuum limit. In particular, the 2D Young's modulus is approximately given by [53] \n",
            " and the bending rigidity is\n",
            " In the continuum limit, the elastic behavior of a thin shell depends ultimately on a single non-dimensional parameter, the Föppl-von Kármán (FvK) number γ = YR 2 κ , which is the ratio of the stretching and bending energies [43, 44, [56] [57] [58] [59] . In terms of the parameters of our model, the FvK number becomes simply\n",
            " Another nice feature of the present coarse-grained model is that it only depends on very few parameters which have a clear and meaningful physical interpretation. In particular, the diameters σ h and σ p represent the effective size of an hexamer and a pentamer, respectively. They can be determined as the diameter of a sphere circumscribing the actual hexameric and pentameric capsomer of a real virus of interest (see figures 3(a) and (b)). The remaining parameters entering into the different interaction potential terms, can be determined for a specific virus either from experiments or atomistic simulations. More specifically, atomistic umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations can be used to the determine the potential of mean force (PMF) between two hexamers or pentamers [60] . Using the distance between the center of masses of two hexamers as reaction coordinate, it is possible to evaluate the atomistic PMF as a function of their separation. This can then be fitted to the Mie expression, equation (3), obtaining the values of m and n, controlling the range of the interaction and ij , representing the minimum of the potential. This procedure has been implemented, for instance, to obtain the effective interaction potential between two CcmK2 hexamers in studies of carboxysome assembly [60] . Alternatively, the effective binding energy between capsomers can be obtained from assembly or calorimetry experiments [61] or estimated by calculating the association energies in the atomistic equilibrium structure, considering the sum of energies due to desolvation, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions between all atoms of the interacting subunits [62] .\n",
            " The parameter ν describes the optimal angle of interaction between two capsomers. It can be approximated by the actual angle between hexamers in the native structure (see figure 3(c)) or even estimated for each T-number shell from a simple geometrical relation [53] cos(ν) = −σ/(2R), where R is the radius of the capsid. Alternatively, it could be evaluated from the PMF in a full-atom simulation of two capsomers in contact for different relative orientations. The orientation corresponding to the minimum of the PMF will directly determine the value of ν. These simulations will be also useful to evaluate the local bending rigidity α, accounting for the energy required to bend the contact between two capsomers out of the preferential angle of interaction. The same simulations can also be used to determine the parameter k t of the torsion potential, by getting the PMF of two hexamers in contact using the torsion angle as reaction coordinate.\n",
            " Hence, by following this protocol one could get an accurate coarse-grained interaction potential between capsomers. With it, one could provide a nearly quantitatively accurate description of nanoindentation experiments of a specific virus of interest. The VAFM thus represents a sort of multiscale approach to simulate the mechanical properties of viruses, where the precise values of the parameters of the effective interactions can be determined from all atom simulations involving just two capsomers, and the global response of the capsid can be simulated at larger length and time scales using a very simple and efficient coarse-grained model. However, instead of pursuing this route for a particular virus, our aim in this work is to perform a more physical study and to explore how the mechanical response and some of the peculiar features observed in AFM nanoindentation experiments depend on the global physical parameters and energetic contributions describing the effective interactions.\n",
            " To that end, we will focus on a specific T-number shell, choosing reasonable values of the parameters and working in reduced units (instead of real units) so that the results can be applied to a wide class of viruses. More specifically, we will study a generic T = 7 shell (representative, for instance, of bacteriophage λ, P22 or T7), fixing a reasonable value of the binding energy, namely hh = 20k B T , which is a characteristic value of the association energies between capsomers obtained from atomic structures in [62] . For this choice, the reduced temperature becomes T = 0.05. All our simulations have been performed with m = 12 and n = 6, i.e. the standard parameters of a Lennard-Jones potential, since those values have been found to reproduce efficiently the assembly of the smallest Caspar and Klug structures [53] . For a T = 7 shell, the appropriate preferred angle between capsomers can be approximated by ν = 1.796, corresponding to the lowest energy structure in [53] . We have set a value for the torsion constant of k t = 1.5, but its precise value does not affect the mechanical response of the shell significantly.\n",
            " The VAFM is a simulation that emulates the nanoindentation process of virus by an AFM, i.e. it simulates the lowering of a spherical tip attached to a microcantilever which exerts a force on a sample, in this case, an empty viral nanocage. The simulation setup is shown in figure 4 . In the simulations we have added a rigid surface at a position z = 0, representing the substrate; the tip of a cantilever at the top, modeled as a sphere which can only move in the z direction, and a preformed capsid between them mimicking the experimental situation. The capsomers, depicted by the red and green spheres in figure 4 , interact pairwise through the coarse-grained potential described earlier. They also interact with the tip and with the substrate.\n",
            " The interaction between capsomers and the sphere of radius R t representing the AFM tip (depicted in figure 4 by a blue sphere) is modeled by the following purely repulsive harmonic potential\n",
            " where k rep is an effective repulsive spring constant, r ic the distance between the center of the cantilever and capsomer i, and σ i is σ p or σ h for a pentamer or a hexamer, respectively.\n",
            " To mimic the deflection of the cantilever caused by the interaction with the capsid, its z-position is updated using the following overdamped Euler equation\n",
            " where dt = 10 −5 is the time step used in the simulations, F c = − i k rep (r ic − (R t + σ/2)) is the total force on the cantilever due to the interaction with all capsomers, k c is the spring constant of the cantilever, D c is its diffusion coefficient, and ξ is a Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance 1. Finally, the substrate (figure 4, black surface) is modelled as a flat rigid surface. To account for potential effects of adsorption with the substrate, as often occurs in experiments, a binding energy of adsorption E ads is considered. This adsorption contribution is described by the interaction potential\n",
            " where σ i /2 is the radius of capsomer i and |z| is the distance between capsomer i and the substrate. In the initial configuration, the empty capsid is placed slightly above the surface and the positions and orientations of all capsomers correspond to the optimal values for the parameters and T-number used. To prevent rotation and sliding in the simulations, the position of some capsomers is fixed, depending on the orientation of the virus. Specifically, for indentations along the 5-fold symmetry we have fixed four pentamers: the two pentamers located on the z-axis can only move in the z direction and another two pentamers having initially y = 0, cannot move in the y-direction. For indentations along the 3-fold, two pentamers have x, y fixed and can only move along z; and another two pentamers are fixed at x = 0.\n",
            " In all simulations some parameters have been fixed, unless stated otherwise: the radius of the tip was set to R t = 3σ and the spring constant of the cantilever to k c = 40 0 /σ 2 . For a typical capsomer size of σ ∼ 10 nm and binding interaction equation to estimate the diffusion coefficient of this typical capsomer size, we get a a characteristic time τ = σ 2 /D ∼ 2.3 μs. The strength of the tip-capsomer repulsion was set to k rep = 80 0 /σ 2 , but the specific value of this parameter is not relevant, since the same results were reproduced for k rep = 160 0 /σ 2 .\n",
            " As in experiments, the simulation procedure involves the progressive lowering of the tip. In our simulations, the z position of the cantilever is initially set to a value above the shell and it is lowered at steps of 0.005σ. We lower the tip typically after 10 6 steps, measuring the average force on the cantilever sampled every 100 steps. The simulation runs for a total of 5 × 10 8 steps corresponding to a total indentation of 2.5σ. For a typical capsomer size of σ ∼ 10 nm, the indentation speed in real units will correspond to 2 μm s −1 , which will be a relatively fast indentation. In some simulations, the retraction of the tip is also simulated, to check the reversibility, using the same number of steps and height increments.\n",
            " With the 'Virtual AFM' it is possible to study the mechanical properties of different capsid structures. Our high-level of coarse-graining makes this model particularly suitable to analyze the nanoindenation of viruses whose detailed atomic structure is not known or of large viruses. As an example, figure 5 shows a snapshot of a simulation and a typical nanoindentation curve obtained with our VAFM for two large viral shells: a T = 13 shell, resembling the external layer of infectious bursal disease virus, and a T = 25 shell mimicking the nanoindentation of adenovirus. To our knowledge, those large shells have not being simulated using full-atomistic or structure-based coarse-grained simulations, since the number of residues involved would make them computationally very expensive.\n",
            " For the sake of simplicity, in this work, we will focus on an empty T = 7 viral shell as a particular example. The T = 7 capsid is a chiral structure that can have two different chiralities: leavo and dextro [63] . In our simulations we have used a T = 7 leavo structure, since this chirality seems to be the most abundant for T = 7 viruses of known structure [64] . We have also performed simulations for a T = 7 dextro shell, finding no significant differences in the results. Figure 6 shows three repetitions of a typical nanoindentation curve obtained from simulations of a 5-fold oriented T = 7 capsid including also the retraction of the tip. As in experiments, from the force F versus z curves we calculate the indentation as δ = −z c − F/k c + z 0 , where z c is the position of the cantilever. The indentation curves are also shifted in z by a distance z 0 in such a way that the tip-sample contact starts at δ = 0.\n",
            " For small indentations, the F versus δ curves show a linear and reversible behavior corresponding to elastic response. At large indentations the linear regime ends up by an abrupt decline of the force, corresponding in this case to the sinking of the top pentamer, that gets inside the capsid, leaving a small hole behind. A second abrupt drop in the force is observed when the tip breaks the upper part of the capsid generating a large hole. This cracking of the capsid is not reversible, as shown by the different routes followed by the retraction curves of the tip. The final structure after retraction sometimes is partially healed as shown in the inset figure of a structure missing one pentamer with a small hole and pentamers and hexamers reorganized. Figure 7 shows similar nanoindentation curves obtained when a 'soft' virus, i.e. one with a relatively low bending stiffness, is indented along its 3-fold axis of symmetry. The indentation curves show an initial linear regime followed by an increase in the slope ended by an abrupt drop in the force which in this case is not associated to the breaking of the shell, but rather to its flattening on top of the substrate, as will be discussed in more detail later on. The critical force and indentation associated with the sudden drop of the curves change in different repetitions of the same simulation. This is indicative of the stochastic, temperature-activated nature of this phenomenon.\n",
            " It is worth emphasizing that the indentation curves obtained using our 'Virtual AFM' are remarkably and qualitatively nearly identical to the experimental curves measured with the real AFM, as illustrated in the comparison between figures 1(a) and (b).\n",
            " As mentioned before, one of the potential uses of the VAFM would be to focus on a specific virus of interest and try to reproduce quantitatively experimental nanoindentation curves by tuning properly the values of the effective interaction parameters. Rather than following this approach, we have opted in the present work to use the VAFM to analyze in global physical terms how the mechanical response of a viral capsid measured in a nanoindentation experiment depends on the physical characteristics of the interaction. In par ticular, we analyze the influence on the mechanical response of different parameters, such as the bending stiffness, related to the parameter α, the radius of the tip, the adsorption energy of the substrate E ads , and the geometry of the indentation. The results are briefly summarized in the following subsections. Figure 8 shows the influence of the bending rigidity on the indentation along the 5-fold orientation of a T = 7 shell with one type of capsomer. The bending rigidity κ of the shell is dictated by the parameter α through equation (11) . As α increases, the bending rigidity decreases and the capsid becomes softer, tolerating larger indentations. For α ∈ [0.1, 0.5] the shape of the shell is spherical and the effective spring constant, obtained from the slope of a linear fit for small indentations, decays as k cap ∼ √ κ ∼ 1/α, as predicted by thin-shell theory [17, 35] . The sudden drop in the force curves for α = 0.1 and α = 0.2 corresponds to a breaking event, associated with the opening of a hole in the upper part of the capsid. However, for α = 0.3 the capsid is very soft, and resists large indentations (of up to 75% of its radius), until its final collapse into a pancakelike shell. For α > 0.3, the shell becomes progressively more faceted. This faceting is noticeable by an increase in its 5-fold height, signalled in the figure by the shifting in the contact point towards negative values. For α > 0.6 the shell undergoes a buckling transition [43] , as indicated by the change in height. The several drops observed in the measured force are due to a progressive faceting or flattening of the shell on top of the substrate rather than to an actual breaking event (which is unlikely because the structure is very soft).\n",
            " An important conclusion of this study is that the effective spring constant measured by AFM is not only determined by the strength and range of the binding interactions (which in this case are kept constant) but also by the bending cost to drive the capsomers away from their preferred angle of interaction. Thus, the Young's modulus is not the only elastic constant determining the effective spring constant of a virus. This aspect, qualitatively captured by equation (2), is often overlooked in the interpretation of experiments.\n",
            " One recurrent question concerning nanoindentation experiments is the influence of the substrate on the measured mechanical properties of viruses. We have analyzed the influence of the adsorption strength with the substrate on the indentation curves for capsids of different bending rigidity. Figure 9 shows the results for a relatively rigid shell with α = 0.1. At small values of the adsorption energy, E ads < 1, the capsid keeps its nominal height and the slope of the indentation curves is insensitive to E ads . However the maximum value of the indentation before the first drop in the force occurs goes down as the adsorption gets stronger. The drop corresponds in this case to the flattening of the bottom part of the virus induced by the applied force. For 1 < E ads < 4, the bottom pentamer and the five surrounding hexamers are initially adsorbed on the substrate leading to a well-defined initial height of the capsid which is smaller than the nominal height (reflected in figure 9 by a shift of the contact point between the tip and the sample).\n",
            " At very large adsorptions, E ads > 4, the strong adsorption eventually flattens and breaks the bottom part of the shell, which stands on the substrate by an adsorbed ring of hexamers, exhibiting a well defined reduced height. As E ads further increases, the height of the supported dome gets down at discrete steps (see the dark green curve in figure 9 for E ads = 10), corresponding to different number of adsorbed capsomers at the adsorption rim. Remarkably, the strongly adsorbed shell which has a broken bottom still exhibits almost the same spring constant as the intact shell.\n",
            " For α = 0.3, corresponding to softer shells with smaller bending rigidity, there is a wide variability of adsorption heights, instead of the discrete set observed for α = 0.1. This behavior has been recently reported experimentally and used to estimate the bending rigidity of Brome mosaic virus [65] . If the adsorption energy is very weak, the indentation curve shows a smaller slope and an inflection or steps in the middle due to the progressive flattening of the bottom part or the lateral faces induced by the force. As E ads increases, the shell shows different apparent heights, corresponding to different levels of adsorption, but the same initial spring constant. For E ads > 4, the shell is strongly adsorbed on the substrate, leading to a partial reorganization of the capsomers and a higher spring constant. Remarkably, despite the strong adsorption, no breaking of the bottom part of the shell occurs even at E ads = 10.\n",
            " To summarize the effects of the substrate, the slope is nearly the same in all curves, showing that reasonable adsorption with the substrate has no significant influence on the stiffness measured in the AFM [65] . However, the apparent heights, breaking forces and critical indentations depend on the adsorption strength and typically get smaller as the adsorption gets larger.\n",
            " Another interesting aspect to explore is the potential influence of the tip radius on the nanoindentation curves. Figure 10 shows the curves obtained using different tip radius for nanoindentations along the 5-fold and 3-fold directions.\n",
            " Remarkably, for indentations along the 5-fold axis (see figure 10 (a)) the well defined contact of the tip with the top pentamer makes that all curves coincide having the same slope. The slope only changes for large indentations for R t > 5, when the tip radius is large enough to press on more than one capsomer at a time. Contrarily, for indentations along the 3-fold axis of symmetry (see figure 10 (b)), the tip is placed in the space between three hexamers, and the contact height depends on the tip size, as indicated by the shift of initial contact points. In addition, the slopes are different and increase continuously with the tip radius up to converging to a constant value for very large, essentially flat, tips. Therefore, the results suggest that the radius of the tip leads to changes in the measured height and spring constant whenever it permits the contact with a larger area of the capsid.\n",
            " One of the most representative characteristics of both experimental and simulated indentation curves are abrupt drops in the force, that occur after the initial linear regime. These force drops have been traditionally attributed to capsid breaking, see figure 1 (a). However, in the simulations we see that many different physical phenomena can happen with the same signature corresponding to a drop in the force. The advantage of the simulations is that one can correlate the observed drops in the force with snapshots obtained from the simulations. In that way, we have observed that sudden drops in the force correspond, very often in an indistinguishable way, to breaking, buckling, rotation and/or sliding. Rotation and sliding are the most common cause of sudden drops in the force when the capsid is not properly immobilized on the substrate. When rotation and sliding are prevented, one could still observe breaking, buckling, and reorganization of capsomers, see figure 11 . It is important to distinguish between breaking and buckling events. Breaking is defined as the disruption of the capsid involving rupture of intercapsomer bonds. This is typically an irreversible phenomenon that is associated with the presence of a crack or hole in the capsid (see figure 11 (a)), as can be observed also in AFM experiments. Breaking is important for the life cycle of virus, since it will expose the genome. In nanotechnological applications it is indispensable to prevent the unwanted breaking of the shell for nanoencapsulation. In a buckling process there is a collective change in the position of several capsomers, leading to a faceting of the structure, without cracks, see figure 11 (c). If the indentation stops just after a buckling event and the tip is retracted we could observe very often that this buckling is reversible.\n",
            " The goal of this section is to characterize a bit better these phenomena and how they depend on different factors such as the bending stiffness of the shell. This information is potentially useful to tune the mechanical resistance of a capsid for different applications or to promote its disruption.\n",
            " A good example of different drops in the force under indentation is plotted in figure 12 , corresponding to a relatively rigid T = 7 capsid indented along the 5-fold direction. This figure shows first a buckling process. The second drop corresponds to the collapse of the bottom pentamer, that adopts the same z-position as the hexamers around it and the third drop is when the structure actually breaks. In experimental force curves the force drops are identical to the ones observed in the simulations, but the mechanism involved in the drop is unknown in most cases. It is usual to interpret always a drop in the force as a breaking event. But with the help of our simulation one can see that this is not always correct, and that the mechanism depends on the elastic characteristic of the capsid. When the bending rigidity of the shell is large, the shell is more fragile, and breaking events are usually the most probable cause of force drops. Buckling appears normally for low values of bending stiffness, corresponding to soft shells that deform easily, preventing rupture.\n",
            " Many viruses, such as bacteriophage T7, change their shape from spherical to polyhedral during the maturation of their capsids [66] . This change in viral shape is present in the maturation of others viruses such as λ or HK97 [29, 67] and it is indispensable to become infective.\n",
            " The change in shape might alter the mechanical response of the shell and could bring some mechanical advantages [38] . Previous works on viruses like λ and HK97, which suffer a transition between spherical and polyhedral shapes during their maturation, show mechanical changes. In particular, λ mature virion is more resistant than its prohead [14, 29] or HK97 virion is stiffer than its prohead, but the prohead tolerates larger deformations [29] .\n",
            " In this section we compare the mechanical response of our model T = 7 shell in its spherical and polyhedral shapes. Using the 'Virtual AFM' it is possible to obtain qualitative information about the mechanical changes associated to a shape change, as the one occurring in viruses upon maturation.\n",
            " In our study, the change in shape was obtained by changing the parameter α related to the bending stiffness [53] . In particular, it was found in [53] that T = 7 structures with one type of subunit exhibit a transition between a spherical shape and a polyhedral shape at α ≈ 0.6. The structure become progressively more and more faceted as α is further increased. We have chosen the values of α = 0.1 to represent the spherical prohead and α = 1.0 for the mature capsid because for this value the structure is noticeable faceted, but stable enough to sustain AFM indentations.\n",
            " As an example, we will analyze the case of bacteriophage T7 with one type of morphological subunit. A value of the interaction between hexamers and pentamers of E hp = 1.4E hh was chosen to reproduce the relative strength of the hexamerhexamer and hexamer-pentamer contact energies reported from the atomic structure in [30, 68] . Figure 13 shows the force versus indentation curves obtained for the model 'prohead' (circles) and 'mature capsid' (triangles) along the 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry axes. In general the spherical shape, for all folds, is stiffer than the polyhedral shape, due to its higher bending rigidity.\n",
            " We have calculated the spring constants for both shapes and observed a change in their relative ordering. Specifically, we obtained k sp 3 = 55.6, k sp 2 = 48.2, k sp 5 = 34.2 ± 0.5 0 /σ 2 0 . Thus, the 3-fold is the stiffest and the 5-fold is the softest. In contrast, for the polyhedral shape we obtained k ico 2 = 11.6, k ico 3 = 9.9, k ico 5 = 5.8 ± 0.5 0 /σ 2 0 , and thus the softest orientation is the 5-fold, and the stiffer is the 2-fold, yielding an order of constants k 2 > k 3 > k 5 .\n",
            " The spring constants obtained in experiments are similar for the prohead and virion in all symmetry axes, contrarily to our simulations. This discrepancy is mainly due to the fact that the increase in α required to obtain the polyhedral shape also modifies significantly the global stiffness of the shell. Thus, in its present form, our model cannot capture realistically the complicated changes associated to viral maturation. However, the order of the spring constant for our polyhedral shell is the same as that found in nanoindentation experiments for the mature T7 capsid [30] . Remarkably, the anisotropic elasticity obtained from AFM indentation experiments of T7 viral capsids does not follow the anisotropy expected from continuum homogenous models [23] . Whereas the experimental results show the spring constant of T7 capsids for each icosahedral symmetry axis as k 5c < k 3c < k 2c , FEM simulations of the stiffness performed in thin shell continuum models establishes k 5 < k 2 < k 3 [30] . In addition, FE simulations of a thin or thick icosahedral shell with the same dimensions as T7 also predict an incorrect order of the spring constants. Remarkably, the results obtained with our VAFM reproduce the same order of the effective spring constants found in the experiments (i.e. k 5c < k 3c < k 2c ). This suggests that the distinct stiffnesses for the different orientations found in the T7 capsid are associated to the discrete nature of its structural components and to their particular arrangement in the final structure.\n",
            " In this article we have presented the implementation of a 'Virtual AFM', a BD simulation using a coarse-grained model for a viral capsid, designed to mimic the standard setup of AFM nanoindentation experiments. This 'Virtual AFM' is a very useful tool to investigate the mechanical properties of viruses, and how they change with the relevant physical parameters. With this tool it is also possible to interpret real experiments, providing a simple way to account for the influence of the discrete structure of the capsid, and obtaining very useful information about the physical ingredients involved in the mechanical response of viral capsids.\n",
            " Our 'Virtual AFM' has been already useful to interpret experiments performed on bacteriophage T7 [30] . The simulations explain the unusual anisotropic stiffness found in these experiments, and reproduce qualitatively the experimental results. We have also analyzed how the measured stiffness depends on different physical parameters, and on the shape of the virus. In particular, we have shown that the measured spring constant not only depends on the Young's modulus of the shell but also on the local bending rigidity between subunits. We have also analyzed the influence of the adsorption with the substrate on the elastic response of a virus. Our findings suggest that the effective spring constant of the virus is almost insensitive to the substrate, but the virus height, breaking forces and maximum indentations depend on the adsorption strength and the bending rigidity of the virus. The radius of the AFM tip has a minor influence on the measured slope, associated with changes in the contact area. We have also shown that sudden drops in the force are not always a signature of breaking of the shell. Adsorption, faceting and buckling can also lead to indistinguishable force drops, evidencing that caution has to be taken in the interpretation of experiments. Finally, we have found that viruses show an anisotropic elastic response where the relative magnitude of the spring constants not only depend on the triangulation number, but also on the shape of the shell. Although in this work we have focused on the T = 7 structure, the Virtual AFM can be a useful tool for many future studies of indentation, buckling and breaking of different T-number viruses.\n",

            "Title: microorganisms Challenging the Conventional Interpretation of HCMV Seronegativity\n",
            "Body Text: It is often assumed that a person who has antibodies reactive against a specific virus (i.e., is defined as \"seropositive\") has been infected and may retain that virus. Viruses such as herpesviruses are known to persist for life while other viruses such as influenza are cleared after infection. The corollary is that a person who is seronegative has never been infected. From this, it is a small step to assume that such people have never been exposed to an infectious dose of the virus. Whilst this is logical with novel viruses (e.g., Zika or SARS-CoV-2), it does not fit the clinical data with respect to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The majority of adults in the world (around 83%) carry antibodies reactive with HCMV [1] . Active infections are usually controlled in healthy individuals, but the virus enters a latent or inactive state and persists with periodic reactivations. In individuals with acquired immune deficiencies, HCMV infections induce diverse but well-characterized clinical syndromes, and reactivations are relatively common [2, 3] .\n",
            " HCMV can be transmitted vertically (transplacentally and through breast feeding) and via organ transplantation and blood transfusions [4] . However, saliva may be the most common route of transmission, as HCMV and murine (M) CMV persist in the salivary gland [5, 6] . We have linked the presence of HCMV DNA in saliva with activation of systemic immune responses consistent with a systemic infection [7] . HCMV may pass to a new host through an oral route [4, 8] , though murine studies suggest the intranasal route effectively initiates primary infection [9] . Transmission via saliva is readily demonstrated in nurseries and crèches [10] but is likely in other situations where individuals are close together. This is not restricted to particular populations.\n",
            " It is accepted that HCMV establishes latency in fixed tissues such that active replication and viral progeny become undetectable. However, in vitro studies have shown that numerous viral genes continue to be expressed, including UL111a, which encodes HCMV viral IL-10 (vIL-10). Poole and Sinclair [11] dubbed HCMV latency as \"sleepless latency\". Throughout life, HCMV undergoes reactivation events and can be shed from asymptomatic hosts or may cause disease.\n",
            " HCMV vIL-10 is differentially spliced, creating several variants [12] . The best characterized transcripts are cmvIL-10, which is only expressed during lytic infection, and LAcmvIL-10, which continues to be expressed during latency. There is evidence that both variants play a role in immunosuppression with LAcmvIL-10 having more restricted functions. A function of LAcmvIL-10 is downregulation of MHC-II, aiding in the prevention of antigen presentation during latency [13] .\n",
            " Despite the plethora of opportunities to become infected, some people remain seronegative all their lives. We considered whether this represents a failure to seroconvert when infected or rapid clearance of HCMV by specific aspects of the innate immune system. The former is possible as we have identified reports of HCMV DNA in urine from seronegative children aged 4-15 years [14] and in blood from seronegative adults [15] . Furthermore, HCMV pp65-and IE-1-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells were detected in seronegative renal transplant recipients (RTR) [16] . Here we describe seven seronegative adults who presented evidence of HCMV infections. Our investigations illustrate mechanisms that may contribute to their failure to seroconvert. This includes vIL-10, which interacts with human IL-10R1, initiating signalling via STAT-3. Its biological activity includes the modulation of cellular IL-10 synthesis [13] . HCMV vIL-10 has been detected in plasma [17] with reagents that are available commercially. The reagents utilized in the assay do not cross-react with human IL-10 or EBV vIL-10 and detect both LAcmvIL-10 and cmvIL-10.\n",

The case establishes the possibility that vIL-10 may suppress seroconversion. This is supported by Cases 5, 6 and 7 (Table 2) . Case 5 was an RTR who failed to seroconvert when given a HCMV-positive donor kidney. Case 6 remained seronegative with detectable plasma vIL-10 from 2006 to 2021.

The plates were then washed three times with 150 µL/well of PBS-0.005% TWEEN and blocked for 1 h with 1% BSA/PBS. A standard curve from 4000 pg/mL to 62.5 pg/mL was created using recombinant HCMV vIL-10 with carrier protein (117-VL-025, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Plasma samples were diluted 1:10 in 1%BSA/PBS and a QC was created by spiking a plasma sample with 500 pg/mL of standard (CV = 17%). A total of 50 uL/well of anti-CMV vIL-10 goat polyclonal biotinylated antibody (BAF117, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) at 0.2 µg/mL was added (2 h, room temperature), followed by a streptavidin-HRP conjugate (30 min, room temperature) and TMB substrate (20 min, room temperature). Reactions were stopped with 25 uL/well 1M H 2 SO 4 and read at 450 nm. Concentrations of vIL-10 were interpolated from the standard curve [20] . The minimum level detected by this assay was 62.5 pg/mL. The assay was confirmed to specifically detect vIL-10 and not cross react with human IL-10 by replacing the recombinant vIL-10 with recombinant human IL-10 (Human IL-10 DuoSet ELISA, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). No cross-reactivity was observed. Young et al., (2017) confirmed that the reagents used in the vIL-10 ELISA do not cross-react with human IL-10 or EBV vIL-10, and demonstrated detection of LAcmvIL-10 and vIL-10 generated during lytic infections [17] .\n",
            " Saliva (approximately 5 mL) was collected after a water mouth wash by asking the participant to spit into a tube. Samples were centrifuged (1000× g, 10 min). DNA was extracted from the pellet using FavorPrep Blood Genomic DNA Extraction Mini Kits (Favorgen, Ping-Tung, Taiwan) and stored at −80 • C. Each DNA extraction run included a no-sample control with saliva replaced by PBS. HCMV was detected using an in-house qPCR assay with primers targeting the UL54 gene (CMV DNA polymerase) presented in Table 1 [7] . Quantitation was achieved using a standard curve created using DNA extracted from a lysate of HCMV (AD169)-infected fibroblasts and serially diluted 10-fold. Samples were considered positive if a steady amplification curve was initiated before 38 cycles (the lowest point on the standard curve). Positive results were normalized against the gene encoding beta-2-microgobulin and values were reported in arbitrary units (range: 44-721) [21] . Some samples also underwent amplification of MIE by qPCR using the same protocol as UL54 with the primers described in Table 1 . All qPCR runs included at least two no-template controls, with PBS controls from the DNA extractions spread across a series of qPCR runs. No amplicons were detected. To achieve greater sensitivity, samples were also assessed with a nested PCR to detect UL55 [22] (encoding gB; see Table 1 ), using a PCR buffer with 35 mM MgCl 2 for the inner reaction and 30 mM MgCl 2 for the outer PCR in a total volume of 20 µL, with 1 µL of each primer (10 µM), 2 µL PCR buffer, 1 µL 40 mM dNTPs, 0.2 uL Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 5 µL DNA (diluted 1:2) for the outer PCRs, and 3 µL of the outer PCR product for the inner PCRs. The cycling conditions for the outer PCRs were 1 cycle of 5 min at 95 • C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 • C and 30 s at 60 • C and then 1 cycle of 1 min at 72 • C. The inner PCRs ran only 30 cycles. PCR products from the inner PCRs were run on 1% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer stained with GelGreen (Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA) for 1 h at 120 volts. Amplicons were sent for purification and Sanger sequencing by the Australia Genome Research Facility (AGRF). All nested PCR runs included a no-template control carried from the outer PCR to the inner PCR, a no-template control for the inner PCR and DNA extracted from uninfected fibroblasts. No amplification was detected.\n",
            " Saliva pellets were thawed and mixed with TRI reagent (1:4) before RNA extraction using the MagMAX-96 for Microarrays kit, as described previously [23] (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Custom reverse transcription primer pools were generated, and cDNA synthesis for all miRNA assays was performed in a single reaction, according to the manufacturer's protocols (Applied Biosystems, PN 4465407) . A pre-designed primer and probe assay targeting mature miRUS5-2-3p (assay ID: 469255_mat was purchased from Applied Biosystems). RNA from HCMV seronegative healthy participants and uninfected THP-1 cells were used to ensure specificity. These showed no amplification up to 40 cycles. Sensitivity was determined using 10-fold serial dilutions of HCMV AD169 RNA. Samples with cycle thresholds below 10 4 dilution of the standard (i.e., after cycle 32-36, depending on the miRNA assayed) were considered negative. All samples were run two to four times and called positive if at least two replicates produced amplification.\n",
            " Eighty-two RTR and eighty-one healthy controls were recruited in 2014 and tested for HCMV-reactive IgG in plasma, HCMV UL54 DNA in saliva and vIL-10 in plasma and saliva. There were no differences in gender or ethnicity between the two groups, but the RTR were marginally older (54 (21-86) vs. 57 (31-76); p = 0.07; Mann-Whitney test, data available in [24] ). Levels of CMV reactive antibodies were determined using in-house ELISAs, recognizing a lysate of fibroblasts infected with HCMV AD169 (\"HCMV lysate\"), gB or IE-1 protein. The cut-off defining seropositivity was 3600 AU/mL based on the HCMV lysate [25, 26] . This cut off was determined in relation to samples from individuals deemed to be seronegative using the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay (Abbott Diagnostic Systems, Lake Forrest, IL, USA). Determinations of HCMV serostatus of RTR were concordant with the ARCHITECT CMV IgG assay according to clinical records. Determinations of serostatus were identical when based on gB or IE-1 (data not shown).\n",
            " Using this cut-off, 13/82 RTR and 32/81 healthy controls were seronegative (χ 2 , p = 0.0007). Here we present seven individuals who were HCMV seronegative by all three ELISAs. Additionally, all seven cases were had no T-cell responses to CMV lysate, IE-1 and pp65 according the ELiSpot assay. Cases 2-7 returned for follow-up in 2017. All remained seronegative by the same ELISA assays, and none had detectable HCMV DNA in their saliva as assessed by in-house UL54 qPCR assay. T-cells were not re-assessed.\n",
            " Cases 1, 2 and 3 had detectable HCMV DNA in their saliva samples, whilst Cases 4, 5, 6 and 7 had detectable HCMV vIL-10 in their plasma (Table 2) . No HCMV vIL-10 was detected in saliva samples from seronegative or seropositive individuals, but vIL-10 was detectable in plasma from 3/32 seronegative healthy controls and 0/13 seronegative RTR in 2014 with one seronegative RTR having detectable vIL-10 in 2012 and 2017 (not 2014). In 2017, 4/23 seronegative healthy controls had detectable vIL-10, including the three who were positive in 2014. \n",
            " Case 1 is a 33-year-old female RTR who received a donor kidney six years before sample collection. She had remained free of graft rejection, diabetes, HCMV or cardiac disease since transplantation and was stable on tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. Her transplanted kidney was from a HCMV-seronegative donor. Accordingly, there was no detectable HCMV IgG, IgA and IgM in her saliva or plasma (Table 2 and unpublished data). She had no HCMV-reactive T-cells when assessed by EliSpot assay. Case 1 was HCMV DNA positive in saliva by our in-house qPCR assays, detecting MIE and UL54, but negative in plasma and buffy coat. Sanger sequencing of amplicons encompassing gB produced by nested PCRs of the saliva identified a mixed infection where the predominate genotype was gB2. The presence of multiple strains was confirmed by sequencing the genes encoding the NK cell receptor homologues UL18 and UL40 (data not shown). HCMV vIL-10 was not detectable in plasma in 2014 or 2017.\n",
            " Case 2 is a 57-year-old female healthy control who was seronegative for HCMV IgG in plasma and HCMV DNA negative by qPCR assays targeting MIE and UL54 in plasma and the associated buffy coat samples. However, she had detectable HCMV DNA in her saliva when assessed with the nested PCR targeting gB (UL55). Sanger sequencing identified a mixed infection where the predominate genotype was gB2. HCMV-miR-US5-2-3p was also detected in her saliva [23] . Neither IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies reactive with HCMV antigens nor HCMV vIL-10 were detectable in her saliva or plasma (Table 2 ; data not shown). She had no HCMV-reactive T-cells when assessed by EliSpot assay. Analysis of her PBMC by flow cytometry revealed expanded populations of FcRγ − and NKG2C + NKcells, characteristic of HCMV infection [19, 27] (Table 2 ). The FcRγ − population comprised 27.3% of CD3 − CD56 dim NK-cells, compared with a median (range) of 9.1% (5.4-19.1) for other seronegative healthy controls (Figure 1 ). The NKG2C + population comprised 7.1% of CD3 − CD56 dim NK-cells, compared with a median (range) of 2.6% (0.9-4.0) for other seronegative healthy controls (Figure 1 ). The same phenotypes were assessed at 2017 showing populations with 15.5% FcRγ − and 11.1% NKG2C + CD3 − CD56 dim cells. In 2017, she had not seroconverted and no HCMV DNA was detected in her saliva. This case suggests the possibility that NK cells can control HCMV replication without seroconversion.\n",
            " Case 3 was also a healthy female with detectable HCMV DNA in her saliva. She was seronegative in 2014 and 2017, and had no T-cell responses when assessed against three HCMV antigens ( Table 2) . HCMV vIL-10 was not detectable in her plasma in 2014 or 2017, and no expanded populations of FcRγ − and NKG2C + NK-cells were evident. Expanded populations of Vδ2 − γδ T-cells are associated with HCMV seropositivity in RTR and healthy controls [18] . Case 3 had a detectable population of Vδ2 − γδ T-cells (2.2% of all γδ T-cells; Table 2 ), compared with a median (range) of 0.47% (0.06-2.08) for other seronegative healthy controls and 0.96% (0.05-3.8) for seropositive healthy controls.\n",
            " Case 4 is a 55-year-old male healthy control who was seronegative for HCMV IgG in plasma by our in-house ELISA assays and HCMV DNA negative by our in-house qPCR assay targeting UL54 in saliva. He works in a hospital environment and is frequently exposed to patients with active HCMV infections, but remained seronegative when tested in 2012, 2014 and 2017. However, HCMV vIL-10 was detected in his plasma at all three time points (1840, 639 and 916 pg/mL) vs. the median (range): 166 (0-1440) for seronegative healthy controls tested in 2014. The case establishes the possibility that vIL-10 may suppress seroconversion. This is supported by Cases 5, 6 and 7 ( Table 2 ). Case 5 was an RTR who failed to seroconvert when given a HCMV-positive donor kidney. Case 6 remained seronegative with detectable plasma vIL-10 from 2006 to 2021. Cases 4-7 had no HCMVreactive T-cells when assessed by EliSpot assay (Table 2 ).\n",
            " HCMV seronegativity is widely assumed to define an individual who is not carrying the virus and has not done so recently. Some seronegative transplant recipients face complications following organ transplantation despite prophylaxis and receiving an organ from a HCMV seronegative donor [28] .\n",
            " From a cohort of 45 (32 controls and 13 RTR) individuals we have identified seven (5 controls and 2 RTR) individuals who remained HCMV seronegative despite evidence of current HCMV replication or latent carriage-specifically HCMV DNA, miRNA, vIL-10 and/or FcRγ − NK cells or Vδ2 − γδ T-cells characteristic of HCMV seropositivity. We consider the possibility that these cases can be explained by low viral load and poor persistence of viral replication. However, many health adults retain readily detectable HCMV-reactive antibodies and T-cells throughout their lives in the absence of detectable HCMV DNA using highly sensitive PCR assays. It could be argued that these seven individuals mount antibody responses selectively to proteins in the UL133-UL154 region that is deleted in AD169, or UL128-131, which are rendered non-functional by to a frameshift mutation in UL131 in AD169 [29, 30] . However, we know of no mechanisms that would explain this selectivity.\n",
            " Cases 1, 2 and 3 had HCMV DNA in saliva, and Case 2 also had detectable HCMV-miR-US5-2-3p [23] . Case 2 had a striking population of FcRγ − and NKG2C + NK cells in circulation. Several studies have linked this population with HCMV seropositivity [27] . We have linked detection of UL54 HCMV DNA in saliva from the same cohort of RTR with systemic markers of HCMV infection [7] . Here we show that Case 2 cleared the salivary infection without seroconversion, since she was DNA and antibody negative in 2017. Her NK cell response may have favoured compartmentalization to the saliva. This may also be achieved through intrinsic immunity mediated by restriction factors (RS), such as interferon gamma-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), which can prevent HCMV DNA sensing by inhibiting UL54 (DNA polymerase) by interacting with CMV pp65 [31] . IFI16 has been found in saliva [32] . Case 3 had a detectable population of Vδ2 − γδ T-cells, which may have cleared the virus sufficiently to prevent seroconversion [33] despite the HCMV DNA found in her saliva. [17] . We show that levels of vIL-10 can be relatively stable in seronegative individuals over time.\n",
            " The detection of vIL-10 may reflect transcription of the encoding gene (UL111a) during HCMV latency [12] , explaining the lack of detectable HCMV DNA. We postulate that these individuals harbor latent or replicating HCMV in tissue(s) other than blood or the salivary gland.\n",
            " We considered the possibility that the presence or absence of detectable vIL-10 reflects variations in UL111a [23] . Viruses identified in Cases 1, 2 and 3 were subjected to ampliconbased enrichment for next generation sequencing of a selection of HCMV genes, including UL111a. The sequence from all three cases had variations when compared to the Toledo reference strain but none were unique to these three samples; i.e., they were also seen in viruses sequenced from HCMV seropositive HIV + individuals from Jakarta (Indonesia; [24] ) and RTR and/or healthy controls from Perth, Australia (manuscript in preparation).\n",
            " The detection of vIL-10 was not rare in the seronegative samples tested (4/32 healthy adults and 1/13 RTR tested between 2014-2017). Case 6 had antibodies reactive with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and all cases are healthy adults active in the community, so any immunosuppressive effects of vIL-10 are presumably HCMV-specific. The individuals also had no T-cell responses to three HCMV antigens (Table 2) , so vIL-10 may also reduce specific T-cell responses. However, proof that vIL-10 downregulates immune responses to HCMV awaits more extensive studies, including further clinical surveys (with analyses of responses to other vaccines) and animal model studies to establish causality. The latter will be complicated as human and mouse CMV show poor homology. Biological effects of vIL-10 to be investigated include enhanced signalling of the CXCR4/CXCL12 pathway triggered by the chemokine receptor homologue US27 [34] . This is distinct from the Stat3dependent effects of vIL-10, which include modulation of dendritic cell function and macrophage activation [35] .\n",
            " Blockage of HCMV seroconversion by vIL-10 has implications for the efficacy of HCMV vaccines. HCMV vaccines currently in phase I or II clinical trials seek humoral responses to selected HCMV antigens, but their efficacy remains low (i.e., <50% [36] ). Indeed, a blockade of vIL-10 has been proposed as a vaccine strategy [35] . Our data supports further development of this approach.\n",
            " We have shown that a proportion of HCMV seronegative adults present evidence of active or latent HCMV infections. These may be transient with control by NK cells (as in Case 2) or persistent with seroconversion blocked by vIL-10. It is clear that seropositivity is a risk factor for adverse outcomes following renal transplantation [37] . However, some seronegative individuals still face complications following organ transplantation and HCMV may play a role.\n",

            "Title: Clinical and epidemiological aspects of human bocavirus infection\n",
            "Body Text: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) caused by viruses represent a major cause of hospitalization and morbidity in young children and infants worldwide. Pathogens associated with this clinical condition include the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. 1 Although a constantly growing number of pathogens is being associated with ARTIs, a high percentage of infections still remain uncharacterized and their causative agents unknown.\n",
            " In 2005 Allander et al. described a previously uncharacterized virus in pools of human nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from children suffering from diseases of the respiratory tract. 2 Comprehensive sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed a close relation of the new virus with the bovine parvovirus (BPV) and the canine minute virus (CnMV), both members of the Bocavirus genus of the Parvoviridae family. It was therefore provisionally named human bocavirus (HBoV).\n",
            " Parvoviruses represent a large family of small, non-enveloped viruses characterized by linear single-stranded DNA-genomes and an exceptional structural simplicity. Besides HBoV two additional parvoviruses, parvovirus B19 (B19V) and PARV4 including its second genotype termed PARV5, are currently known or discussed to infect humans. [3] [4] [5] For almost three decades B19V has represented the only member of the virus family to cause illness in humans, e.g. the self-limiting childhood disease Erythema infectiosum. 6 Additionally, B19V infections during pregnancy are known to frequently result in intrauterine infections of the fetus, occasionally leading to miscarriage or Hydrops fetalis. 7 While the clinical relevance of PARV4 remains unclear up to date, evidence for an influence of HBoV infections in the manifestation of respiratory and gastric symptoms is accumulating.\n",
            " For detection of HBoV VP2-specific IgG and IgM, 100 ng of purified HBoV VP2 virus-like particles (VP2-VLP) were generated as previously described 8 and coated onto Nunc-Immuno TM MediSorp TM plates (Nunc GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) in coating buffer (0.2 M Na 2 CO 3 , 0.2 M NaHCO 3 , pH 9.5) overnight at 4 • C. The plates were subsequently washed six times with washing buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked with dilution buffer (PBS, 2% Tween 20, 3% FCS) for 1 h at 37 • C. After incubation with respective serum samples for 2 h at 37 • C, the plates were washed and rabbit anti-human IgG-or IgM-specific HRP-coupled secondary antibodies were added for 1 h at 37 • C (1:6000 and 1:1000 in dilution buffer, respectively; both Dako Deutschland GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Development was performed using the BD OptEIA TM Substrate (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n",
            " As an international IgG standard for HBoV is not yet available, serially diluted sera of a healthy adult male (age: 28 years) and of a boy (age: 22 months) both exhibiting strong HBoV-specific IgG-and IgM-responses, respectively, were introduced for internal reference and used for the calculation of HBoV-specific antibody titers in all performed experiments. Sera with background optical densities were considered negative and used for the determination of respective IgG/IgM cut-off values, which were additionally confirmed by Western blot analysis.\n",
            " All reports listed in the PubMed-database of the National Library of Medicine (Rockville Pike, MD, USA) until May 2008 have been considered and evaluated in this review.\n",
            " Up to date, no cell culture systems for the in vitro replication of HBoV have been described. Therefore, diagnosis of HBoV infection has so far mainly been based on the detection of viral genomes present in human respiratory, serum, stool, and urine samples using different PCR techniques employing numerous sets of primers specific for the viral genes NP1, 2,9-12 NS1 12-15 and VP1/2. 11, 12, [16] [17] [18] Recent reports describe the detection of HBoV-specific antibodies directed against the viral capsid proteins VP1 and/or VP2 in serum samples using ELISA, 19, 20 Western blot, 21 and immunofluorescence assays. 22 Up to date, no cross-reactions of HBoV-and B19V-specific humoral and/or cellular immune responses have been described.\n",
            " HBoV-DNA has been frequently detected worldwide in respiratory, 2,9-11,13-16,18,23-66 serum, 30, 43 fecal, 17, 30, 33, 35, 38, 67, 68 and urine samples 38 obtained from infants mainly around 2 years of age. The prevalence of HBoV-DNA has been described to vary considerably between 2.7-19% in children suffering from ARTIs and 0.8-9.1% in patients with gastroenteritis. 17, 25, 35, 43 However, since the majority of currently published studies have been performed retrospectively, these variations in viral prevalence may be explained by differences in the study populations and patient characteristics. In infected infants, viral loads have been described to range between < 500 to 10 10 and <10 3 to 5.9 × 10 5 genome copies in nasopharyngeal aspirates and fecal samples, respectively. 25, 37, 43, 52 In serum, we have detected viral loads of up to 1.2 × 10 6 /ml. 69 Only limited data is available on the prevalence of HBoV viremia in asymptomatic individuals, since most of the studies have focused on children with distinct clinical symptoms of infectious diseases. In a first study a total of 96 healthy controls were included for diagnostic analysis of HBoV, yet no viral DNA was observed in respiratory samples from these individuals. 16 Furthermore, we were unable to detect HBoV-DNA in sera collected from 298 healthy adult blood donors. However, a recent publication describes the detection of viral genomes in 5% of respiratory samples obtained from asymptomatic children. 24 While most studies have detected the virus during the winter season, 2,28,33,38,46,70 single reports describe increased numbers of viral infections in spring or summer. 9, 31, 40 No information is currently available on the routes of viral transmission. However, since HBoV can be frequently detected in respiratory and fecal samples, a transmission of the virus via aerosols or direct contact has to be presumed. Thereby, the contagiousness of virus-containing body secretions might be potentiated by the exceptional stability of parvoviral virions and might facilitate increased frequencies of nosocomial infections.\n",
            " Up to date, only a limited number of studies have been focused on the analysis of HBoV-specific adaptive immune responses in healthy individuals and infants suffering from ARTIs, mainly due to the initial lack of recombinant viral antigens and standardized diagnostic methodologies.\n",
            " In the first report published on HBoV seroprevalence Endo and co-workers describe ubiquitous IgG-responses against the viral capsid protein VP1 in up to 100% of children aged ≥2 years with respiratory infections. 22 The overall seroprevalence of HBoV-specific IgG in the Japanese population aged between 0 months and 41 years was 71.1%, while seronegative patients were observed most frequently in infants with 6-12 months of age.\n",
            " In a subsequent study the prevalence of HBoV-specific antibodies in Finnish infants suffering from ARTIs was assessed using Western blot. 21 In children determined positive for HBoV-DNA, IgGand IgM-antibodies against the viral VP2 protein were observed in 73% and 49% of analyzed samples, respectively. The mean age of these children was 2.1 years. The overall prevalence of HBoVspecific IgG and IgM in children without detectable viral genomes in nasopharyngeal samples was 35% and 13%, respectively. Antibodies against the aminoterminal domain of the viral VP1 protein, termed VP1-unique region, were detected rarely: only 7% (IgG) and 2% (IgM) of the patients showed positive results. In contrast to the data provided by Endo and colleagues and by our group (see below), the prevalence of HBoV-specific IgG was shown to decline from 52% in 1-2 year old infants to 29% in children aged over 5 years in the Finnish study. 21 Furthermore, maternal VP2-specific IgG were not observed in children <6 months of age despite a seemingly high seroprevalence of HBoV in adults. This finding may be due to the maturation of IgG-specificity in the time period of up to 6 months following an acute infection, during which antibodies against linear epitopes get replaced by those preferentially recognizing conformational antigen structures. This process has been well documented for B19V-specific humoral immune responses, 71 and therefore it may be assumed that similar changes in IgG affinity take place during HBoV infections.\n",
            " More recently, we and others have established ELISA assays based on the use of recombinant HBoV VP2-VLP for the detection of HBoV-specific antibodies in human serum samples. 19, 20 Herein, our group observed the prevalence of IgG 1 subclass antibodies against HBoV VP2-VLP to rise from 24% in children with 7-9 months of age to 98.3% adult blood donors (mean age: 42 years).\n",
            " In addition to humoral immune reactions the presence of HBoV-specific T-cells in healthy adults supports a high prevalence of HBoV-specific immunity in adults. Thereby, frequent interferon-gamma (IFN-) mediated CD4 + T helper cell reactions were observed against HBoV capsid proteins. 8 Similar data have been previously described for B19V-specific cellular immune responses. [72] [73] [74] [75] \n",
            " HBoV infections are frequently linked to high rates of coinfections with viral and bacterial pathogens of the respiratory and/or gastrointestinal system. Together with the fact that most of the studies have been performed retrospectively and longterm follow-up studies with detailed clinical characterization of symptomatic individuals are rare, it is currently difficult to clearly determine HBoV as sole infectious agent of human illnesses.\n",
            " Up to date, HBoV infections have been detected in young children around the age of 2 years with acute diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract, 2, [9] [10] [11] 13, 14, 16, 18, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] frequently in combination with interstitial lung infiltrates and abnormal radiologic findings. 2, 28, 37, 45, 55 In HBoV positive individuals, we detected both virus-specific IgG and IgM in 42% of studied sera, whereas no IgM were observed in samples obtained from children without detectable amounts of HBoV genomes in blood.\n",
            " Symptoms and disease manifestations observed in HBoV infected children include pneumonia, bronchiolitis, wheezing, respiratory distress, hypoxia, fever, rhinitis, laryngeal croup and, more rarely, conjunctivitis or rashes. In adults, acute HBoV infections leading to ARTIs seem to be rare and have been currently detected mainly in immunocompromised 13, 49, 51, 76 and only in single immunocompetent individuals. 13, 16 Recently, the presence of elevated viral loads in nasopharyngeal aspirates (>10 4 genome copies/ml) has been suggested to correlate with the severity of respiratory symptoms during HBoV infection, whereas low viral loads (<10 4 genome copies/ml) may represent viral persistence. 43 These data are in contrast to those published by Kleines et al. who could not find a relation between the viral load and the severity of HBoV associated illness, 37 indicating that further work is necessary to study the influence of the viral load on respiratory disease manifestation. However, infections with the related parvovirus B19 often result in a prolonged replication of the virus in infected individuals 5 and therefore mechanisms of persistence may also apply for HBoV.\n",
            " Individuals found positive for HBoV-DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates are frequently found to be co-infected with a multitude of additional viral and/or bacterial respiratory pathogens. Thereby, high rates of co-infections reaching up to 91% have been observed. 26 Commonly detected additional pathogens include RSV, human adenovirus, rhinovirus, and Streptococcus sp. Despite these high rates of co-infection, HBoV viremia has been frequently described to be significantly more prevalent in infants suffering from ARTIs than in age-matched asymptomatic control groups, 24, 26, 28, 43, 51 and therefore a role of HBoV in the development of human respiratory diseases is to be presumed. This finding is supported by our data, which show a significantly higher prevalence of HBoV infections in young children with lower respiratory tract infections (14.6%, 7/48) as compared to a control group of age-matched individuals hospitalized due to non-infectious conditions such as bone fractures or planned surgeries (5.0%, 3/60).\n",
            " In addition to respiratory symptoms, HBoV is currently discussed to be associated with gastroenteritic symptoms. Similar features are known from veterinary infections with the closely related BPV and CnMV, which are known to induce gastric illness in their respective hosts. 77, 78 First reports have described the prevalence of HBoV genomes to range between 0.8% and 9.1% in fecal samples obtained from children suffering from acute gastroenteritis, often in combination with ARTIs. 17, 28, 31, 33, 35, 53, 63, 67 In a recent prospective study we detected HBoV-DNA in 7.8% (5/64) fecal samples obtained from young children exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms, e.g. diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. An additional child tested positive for HBoV was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease.\n",
            " As co-infections with intestinal pathogens, e.g. human rotaand noroviruses, enteropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli or Salmonella sp., have been frequently observed in up to 77.6% of HBoV positive individuals, an association of HBoV with gastroenteritis remains unclear. 68 Since in many cases HBoV-DNA has been detected concurrently in both stool samples and nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from young children with ARTIs, 11 the presence of HBoV in fecal samples might represent natural viral shedding during an acute HBoV infection and not play an active role in the pathogenesis of gastric disease.\n",
            " Although HBoV was detected only three years ago, both epidemiological and clinical data establishing the virus as the second member of the Parvoviridae pathogenic to humans are accumulating. Based on current reports it seems most likely that HBoV may be associated with respiratory infections in young children and infants, while a further connection between HBoV and gastrointestinal symptoms has been suggested. However, as acute HBoV infections are often accompanied by infections with additional pathogens of both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, a final establishment of HBoV as the causative agent of infectious disease in humans needs to be confirmed by additional prospective studies. The methodological heterogeneity used for the diagnosis of HBoV infection raises questions about the specificity and comparability of many published studies, highlighting the urgent need of internationally standardized diagnostic guidelines and reference samples for the detection of HBoV genomes and virus-specific immune responses in human samples. As serological diagnostics of HBoV infection will become more important in the future, standardized viral DNA and antibody specimen should be provided as a basis to establish comparable test systems.\n",
            " Nevertheless, first data obtained from healthy control individuals and children with symptoms of non-infectious disease indicate distinctly lower rates of HBoV infections in comparison to patients suffering from ARTIs. Whether HBoV might require the presence of helper-viruses to establish human illness or may even act as the provider of such co-factors for other respiratory viruses, remains to be assessed in further studies.\n",

            "Title: Construction and Characterization of Virus-Like Particles: A Review\n",
            "Body Text: Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multisubunit self-assemblycompetent protein structures with identical or highly related overall structure to their corresponding native viruses [1] . The term ''VLP'' has been used to describe a number of biological objects, such as uncharacterized structures with viral morphology that are found in biological samples, empty structures of viral origin that are not composed of nucleic acids, infectious viruses with chemically or genetically introduced structure modifications and noninfectious, self-assembled gene products resulting from the cloning and expression of viral structural genes in heterologous host systems. A cumulative search for the term ''virus-like,'' which is the most accepted name for these particles, in Google Scholar yielded 15,700 publication records through 1995, approximately 42,000 through 2005, and at least 102,000 publications through the middle of 2012. These data demonstrate the continuously increasing interest of scientists and technologists in different aspects of VLP-based technologies.\n",
            " The interest in new VLPs was largely inspired by the successful development and introduction of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen [2] and the human papilloma virus (HPV) capsid protein L1 [3] as commercial vaccines against hepatitis B and HPV-induced cervical cancer, respectively. Recently, several VLP-based vaccine candidates have entered different stages of clinical investigations with the aim to develop VLP-based vaccines for medical and veterinary purposes in the near future [4, 5] .\n",
            " The results of numerous studies suggest the high-immune response-stimulating activity of VLPs and demonstrate the B cell activation and high-titer antibody production that is triggered by the surface-displayed, structured and densely repeated amino acid (AA) motifs of the VLPs [6, 7] . In addition, the nanometer-sized VLPs can be taken up by antigen-presenting cells and degraded, which ultimately leads to T cell activation [8] . Moreover, due to their symmetric and highly repetitive AA structures, VLPs are capable of inducing strong humoral and cellular immune responses even in the absence of frequently used adjuvants [9] .\n",
            " VLPs have great potential for a number of applications in addition to vaccines. The treatment of many hereditary and acquired genetic disorders by different gene therapy tools is one of the most important challenges that are being addressed through the progress of nanotechnology. Comparisons of different nanocontainers suggest that icosahedral, filamentous, and lipid-enveloped virus-like vectors are the most promising gene carriers [10] . The current success of gene therapy is largely based on viral vectors and synthetic liposomes, although both have a number of limitations, such as restricted packaging capacity, production difficulties, and undesirable immunological properties. However, due to their construction flexibility, VLPs can be engineered to overcome these disadvantages, which include the use of chemical modifications to reduce unwanted immunological responses after repeated use [11] .\n",
            " In addition to the potential applications of VLPs as vaccines and gene therapy tools, particular interest has recently been paid to the development of new nanomaterials that are composed of different viruses and VLPs. This new area of biotechnology, which is called bionanotechnology, represents a broad multidisciplinary approach that employs concepts and methodologies from biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering [12] . As new nanomaterials, viruses and VLPs possess several advantages over the products that are produced by chemical synthesis, including their size, which ranges from 10 to 2000 nm, the availability of high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) models of their structure, their construction flexibility through chemical and molecular biological techniques, their high-production yields in natural and/or heterologous hosts, and the structural uniformity of each type of virus or VLP [13] .\n",
            " Narrowly, VLPs can also be defined as replicationincompetent macromolecular protein assemblies that consist of one or several structural proteins of different viruses and can be obtained from recombinant organisms via the expression of the corresponding cloned genes [14] . This review summarizes the publicly available data on VLPs from recombinant sources and discusses the main principles and methods that are used to construct and characterize these macromolecular assemblies. In some cases, examples from experiments that use native viral structural proteins as a source of VLPs are included to demonstrate the remarkable ideas and techniques that are used to obtain and characterize VLPs. Information on replication-competent VLPs and synthetic nanoparticles with virus-like properties can be found in other review articles [1, 15, 16] .\n",
            " Since the beginning of the 1980s, over 100 VLPs that originated from microbial, plant, insect, and mammalian viruses have been constructed and characterized. The aim of these studies was to use these particles for a variety of purposes, from basic virus assembly and structure studies to the production of commercial human and animal vaccines. Examples of VLPs from 35 different virus families, which are grouped according to the structure of their encapsidated nucleic acids, are summarized in Tables 1, 2 \n",
            " Historically, the first recombinant VLPs were obtained from synthesized and cloned coat protein (CP) genes from the HBV core antigen (HBcAg) [17] , the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) [18] , and the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) [19] . The first visualization of recombinant VLPs using electron microscopy was published in 1982, which demonstrated that the HBcAg VLPs were indistinguishable from the core shells that were isolated from an HBVinfected liver [20] .\n",
            " These first examples established several important ground rules for the construction of recombinant VLPs: (i) the construction of recombinant VLPs is largely based on several years (or even tens of years) of basic research on the corresponding virus; (ii) the necessary coding nucleic acids for the carrier coat protein(s) and for foreign functional peptides can be obtained synthetically from the aligned oligonucleotides; (iii) the foreign peptides can be inserted or added to the virus-based carrier molecule without influencing the self-assembly; (iv) VLPs can be obtained from heterologous hosts; and (v) newly constructed recombinant VLPs have significant advantages over native viruses, such as their availability in nearly unlimited amounts and similar or even better functional properties.\n",
            " The first stage of VLP construction is the cloning of the necessary structural genes. Clinical or veterinary specimens, as well as some environmental samples, such as infected plant or microorganism cells, typically serve as the source of these genes. Taking into account the fact that over 1,500,000 nucleotide sequence records can be found after a search of the Entrez site (The Life Science Search [25] Engine, NCBI) using the keyword ''virus,'' the sequence of the viral structural protein of interest can likely be found in the databases. In most cases, this sequence is sufficient to use oligonucleotides for the gene synthesis in the absence of infected material. It should be noted that the gene synthesis permits the inclusion of typical AA codons for the heterologous host in the target gene, which enhances the expression level of the target protein. Alternatively, at least in the case of E. coli, the usage of special host strains that synthesize rare AA codon-recognizing tRNAs can stimulate the efficient synthesis of the VLPs from their original sequence [21] . Typically, all known VLPs are derived from viruses that are well characterized, at least at the level of full-length nucleotide sequence and genome organization. Due to the vast amount of information that is available on different VLPs, it is not possible to analyze the details of the cloning of the viral structural genes in each case. Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 contain the list of structural genes for each virus family, the expressed genes that are necessary for the construction of the respective VLPs and examples with citations.\n",
            " One of the crucial factors in the construction of new VLPs is the choice of expression system. The analysis of the published reports on the successful construction of 174 VLP (Supplemental Tables 1-4) indicates that bacterial systems are used in 28 % of the cases, particularly for the production of bacterial and plant VLPs. The yeast (20 %) and insect systems (28 %) are more universal, and these expression hosts have been successfully used for the construction of VLPs from different sources. Plant (9 %) and mammalian hosts (15 %) are typically used to insure the production of VLPs with specific properties.\n",
            " Bacterial systems are mostly based on well-characterized commercial Escherichia coli strains and expression vectors. Despite their disadvantages, such as their inability to produce recombinant proteins with post-translational modifications, their inability to generate the proper disulfide bonds, the protein solubility problems, and the presence of endotoxins in the preparations of recombinant proteins. E. coli systems are a generally accepted technology that satisfies many research and industrial requirements and have been widely used for VLP production. A successful VLP production using E. coli is likely achievable in cases in which the target VLPs contain only one coat protein (CP; see Tables 1, 3, 4) that is soluble in the cells after cultivation. However, recombinant proteins, [22] and the CCMV [23] and CMV [24] plant viruses, viral CPs can also be efficiently produced in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies, purified under denaturing conditions, refolded, and self-assembled. Moreover, the self-assembly of VLPs in E. coli cells can be initiated by the simultaneous coexpression of a specific RNA structure, e.g., origin of assembly, with the CP gene [25] .\n",
            " However, a simple change in the cultivation conditions can solve the problem of inclusion bodies. Low-temperature cultivations, which are rather atypical for E. coli, may stimulate the formation of soluble VLPs, as shown in the case of the densovirus IHHNV [26] and the potyvirus PVY [27] . In addition, several factors, such as the resistance markers of the expression plasmids and the composition of the cultivation medium, can influence the assembly of VLPs, as demonstrated with the bacteriophage Qb VLPs [28] .\n",
            " E. coli cells have also been used for the complicated production of VLPs that require more than one type of structural protein for their formation. After the cloning and expression in E. coli of the avibirnavirus IBDV VP2-, VP4-, and VP3-containing polyprotein gene (Table 3) , the polyprotein was cotranslationally autoprocessed by protease VP4 activity, which enables the formation of immunologically active VLPs in bacterial cells [29] . However, as shown with the plant virus MRFV, the inclusion of the corresponding protease gene in the [30] . Another approach that can be used to achieve higher expression levels and solubility involves the usage of different fusion protein systems. The papillomavirus HPV L1 protein was obtained from recombinant E. coli cells in the form of a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, and the VLP assembly of the L1 protein was completed after the GST section was removed with thrombin. The quality of the resulting particles was sufficient to obtain L1 crystals for subsequent X-ray crystallographic analysis, which resulted in the construction of a 3D model of T = 1 icosahedral HPV L1 particles [31] . This fusion protein strategy has also been successfully exploited with the polyomavirus MuPyV [21, 32] and the picornavirus FMDV [33] VLPs. When the N-terminal part of the CP is located on the VLP surface, the N-terminally added short peptides, such as His-tag or small protein epitopes, do not influence the particle formation and can be directly introduced into the VLP structure without proteolytic cleavage and reassembly in vitro [27, 34] .\n",
            " Other prokaryotic organisms can also be used for VLP production. For example, Lactobacillus has been used for the production of the HPV L1 protein to generate edible vaccine candidates [35] , and Pseudomonas was used to improve the low solubility of the CP of CCMV [36] .\n",
            " Since the first successful experiments with HBV surface protein, which led to the production of commercial prophylactic vaccines against hepatitis B and the use of HPV L1 VLPs as a vaccine against cervical cancer, different yeast systems have been used for the construction of numerous VLPs, including the expression of viral structural genes of bacterial [37] [38] [39] , yeast [40, 41] , plant [42, 43] , and mammalian [18, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] origin (see also Supplemental Tables). Yeast expression systems, especially those that are based on Pichia and Hansenula strains, are more complicated than E. coli expression systems from the point of view of construction because yeast shuttle-vectors have to first be prepared in bacteria and then introduced into the yeast cells as plasmid vectors or selected to obtain stable yeast recombinants with a genome-integrated transgene.\n",
            " Comparative studies of the yeast expression systems revealed the efficiency of Pichia in the production of RNA bacteriophage VLPs. However, this production results in approximately 30 % of the yield that is obtained in E. coli, as was observed with the Qb VLPs [38] . A yeast system can also be used for the packaging of functional heterologous mRNA in bacteriophage MS2 VLPs if the simultaneous synthesis of the CP and the mRNA of the model protein is accomplished from the same expression vector. In this case, the design of the expression cassette requires the presence of special packaging RNA sequence that is found in the native MS2 genome [37] . However, these packaging signals are not always necessary for the formation of VLPs in yeast cells. The Saccharomyces expression system produces soluble CCMV VLPs that contain mostly host-derived RNA [43] , which is contrary to the E. coli-based expression system, in which the CPs form inclusion bodies. Another advantage of yeast systems is the possibility of introducing post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation or phosphorylation, to the VLP structure, as shown with the hepatitis B VLPs [44, 47] . Similar to the VLPs from recombinant bacteria, successful multigene expression systems have also been constructed in yeasts. The expression of three rotavirus structural genes (Table 3) from a single plasmid vector lead to the formation of triplelayered VLPs in S. cerevisiae cells [48] . However, in the case of enveloped viruses, such as HIV-2, S. cerevisiae cells do not support the multimerization of the Gag protein into VLPs and particle budding, which suggests that yeast does not contain the necessary host factors [49] . It is important to note that VLP formation does not always take place during the cultivation process of the yeast cells. Experiments with HBsAg from Pichia suggest that the selfassembly of the VLPs should be completed during the purification of the target product [50] .\n",
            " Insect cell-based expression systems are widely used for VLP production on the laboratory or industrial scale due to a number of advantages, such as the fast growth rates in animal product-free media, the capacity for large-scale cultivations, and the ability of post-translationally modifying the recombinant proteins similarly to mammalian cells [51] . The insect cell line derived from Trichoplusia ni is used for the production of the commercial HPV L1-VLP vaccine. In addition, at least 7 additional VLPs that are isolated from recombinant insect cells are at different stages of development as vaccine candidates [52] .\n",
            " For the expression of foreign viral protein genes in insect cells, the construction of vectors based on the modified baculoviruses is necessary. To obtain VLPs that contain more than one structural protein, insect cell lines are infected with multiple different monocistronic baculoviruses (coinfection) or with a single polycistronic baculovirus (coexpression). The coinfection strategy is the more accepted approach because it allows the manipulation of the relative expression levels of the corresponding structural proteins [53] . Moreover, this strategy allows the identification of the proteins that are necessary for VLP formation. Using a coinfection methodology, 6 different proteins have been shown to be simultaneously expressed and self-assembled into VLPs within the same cell, as demonstrated with the herpesvirus HSV [54] . The coexpression strategy was also shown to be effective in the construction of some VLPs, including those derived from influenza, using a tricistronic baculovirus with a triplicated polyhedron promoter [55] or even a quadrupole baculovirus with three polyhedrin and one p10 promoter [56] .\n",
            " The construction of VLPs from viruses with a polyprotein genome organization can be accomplished through the cloning of the whole polyprotein gene into the baculovirus vector. The polyprotein strategy has been successfully used in the case of the alphavirus SAV. The concerted action of the alphavirus protease from the polyprotein and the host-derived proteases at atypically low-cell culture cultivation temperatures are crucial factors for the formation and maturation of the VLP [57] . Similar results using the polyprotein cleavage approach were obtained with the plant virus CPMV [58] . As demonstrated in experiments with the entorovirus-71 VLPs, the polyprotein strategy can be more efficient in terms of VLP yields than the coinfection method [59] .\n",
            " Interestingly, baculovirus-based vectors can also be used with the whole insect larvae, including silkworm larvae [51] , as a cheaper alternative to produce VLPs [60] . The most recent baculovirus-silkworm multigene expression system insures the simultaneous expression of six different transgenes from a single recombinant baculovirus [61] .\n",
            " Initially, the attempts to generate VLPs in whole transgenic or natural plants with different transient expression vectors were tightly bound to the idea of edible vaccines. However, modern medical concepts require precisely formulated vaccine products and supervised administration to insure reproducible effects, which has made injectable vaccines more acceptable [62] . Despite the revision of the concept, plant systems remain a cost-effective and scalable alternative for the production of different medicinal proteins, including vaccines [63] . Some recent developments, such as the Norwalk VLPs that were manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions for subsequent clinical trials [64] and the results of the first human trials of edible vaccines [65] , continue to support the idea that VLPs from plant sources can be used as vaccines and suggest the necessity for further research in this area.\n",
            " The principles for the construction of VLPs in different plant expression systems, the successful production of VLPs in plants and the self-assembly of numerous viral structural proteins in plant hosts are extensively discussed in several review articles [63, 66, 67] . As an example, one of the most effective plant expression systems is based on the Agrobacterium-mediated transfer of a tobamovirusderived expression vector in whole plant cells, which resulted in yields of up to 3 g of recombinant VLPs per kg of leaf biomass [68] .\n",
            " It should be mentioned that plant hosts that are infected with native viruses can serve as a source of assemblycompetent viral structural proteins for the construction of new nanomaterials [69] .\n",
            " For over two decades, the use of mammalian cell cultures as a source of commercial therapeutic proteins has been developed [70] . Taking advantage of the product authenticity and the correct glycosylation pattern that are obtained with this system, more than half of all of the recombinant proteins in the pharmaceutical industry are produced in different mammalian cell lines [71] . Despite the complexity in the construction and practical applications, mammalian cell line systems are widely used for VLP production both in basic experiments and on the industrial scale with the aim to construct vaccine candidates and gene therapy agents. Different mammalian cells are especially efficient hosts for the construction of complex enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses. If a stable mammalian cell line expressing four influenza structural proteins is constructed, it is possible to create hybrid VLPs that contain matrix proteins from one influenza type (H3N2) and surface glycoproteins from another type (H5N1) [72] . This system would allow the generation of correctly glycosylated VLPs, which are similar in size to the native viruses, with encapsidated host cellular proteins and high-immunological activity. The most complicated system that has been developed to obtain VLPs was shown with influenza viruses. A cell line that was infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vector that expresses the T7 polymerase and transfected with bacterial plasmids containing the cDNAs of all ten influenza virus proteins was able to produce VLPs. Moreover, the model protein mRNA after cDNA transcription was rescued into the influenza VLPs [73] .\n",
            " The polyprotein strategy, which was described above, can also be used in mammalian cells. The polyprotein cDNA that encodes all of the structural proteins of the alphavirus CHIKV was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector, which was then introduced into a human cell line; the resultant cells produced CHIKV VLPs, as demonstrated through immunological and electron microscopy analyses [74] . Interestingly, these experiments demonstrated that the CHIKV VLPs are able to elicit stronger antibody responses than the corresponding DNA vaccines [74] .\n",
            " Crude cell extracts have been used as a tool for protein synthesis for over 50 years. In the past, cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) was mostly used in basic studies of the transcription and translation mechanisms, as well as for the rapid evaluation of different expression systems. In recent years, the development of CFPS has reached the stage of an independent expression system with potential industrial significance. CFPS systems based on E. coli, wheat germs, insect cells, and rabbit reticulocytes are now commercially available. The most popular is the E. coliderived CFPS due to the simple preparation of the extract and the comparably high yields of the desired proteins [75] . Recently, the synthesis of the RNA bacteriophage MS2-, Qb-, and HBV core-derived VLPs has been demonstrated using E. coli-based CFPS technology. In the case of the Qb VLPs, the CFPS allows the incorporation of the A2 protein, which is toxic for living cells [76] , whereas the production of the HBcAg, MS2 and Qb VLPs in the chosen cell-free system provides considerable stabilization of the particles through the introduction of disulfide bonds [77] . It is notable that the yield of the VLPs is almost 1 mg/ml and the efficiency of the VLP assembly exceeds 80 % in the case of HBcAg and Qb. These proof of concept experiments using well-established VLP models suggest that CFPS can also be used with more complicated cases, especially when the expression of the viral structural protein genes is toxic for living cells or if the conditions for the traditional systems do not allow the production of VLPs with the desired properties, e.g., when the incorporation of unnatural amino acids is necessary [78] .\n",
            " To insure that the constructed and synthesized VLPs remain intact for the intended downstream applications, the selection of the correct purification scheme is of the utmost importance. The VLP purification and characterization is largely based on experience that has been obtained in experiments with different viruses. Therefore, the initial conditions for the development of a purification protocol for a newly constructed and uncharacterized VLP can be based on those used with the corresponding native virus. In this section, the most important methods that are currently used in VLP purification, identification, and characterization will be reviewed.\n",
            " Because VLPs have been industrial products for over two decades, the general principles of VLP purification are well known and include the following steps: (i) the lysis of the cell to transfer the synthesized VLPs to the solution; (ii) the clarification process to insure the removal of cell debris and other large aggregates; (iii) the concentration step; and (iv) the polishing step to remove the residual host or target product-derived impurities [79] .\n",
            " The cell lysis is a very important step in VLP purification. However, because many mammalian and insect cell systems insure the secretion of the VLPs into the culture supernatants, the cell lysis step is not always necessary [52] . The VLPs produced in non-secreting systems require the use of a suitable approach to prepare the cell-free extract. For example, the simple treatment of eukaryotic cells with detergent-containing solutions is sufficient. In contrast, bacterial, yeast, and plant cells require strong mechanical treatment, such as various mills or French presses, ultrasonication, grinding with abrasives (e.g., aluminum oxide), repeated freezing/thawing cycles, and enzymatic treatments [80, 81] . For the purification of uncharacterized VLPs with unknown stability properties, different cell lysis protocols and extraction buffer compositions are tested to identify the optimal method that preserves the integrity of particles.\n",
            " To protect the VLPs from oxidation and host proteases during the purification process, the extraction buffers are often supplemented with reducing and chelating agents and protease inhibitors. In addition, nucleases are sometimes added at this stage to reduce the amount of host nucleic acids in the extracts. After clarification by low-speed centrifugation or ultrafiltration, the VLP-containing solutions have to be further concentrated and purified. A number of viruses and VLPs are stable enough to withstand precipitation with ammonium sulfate and/or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The precipitation significantly decreases the volume of the extract and the amount of host-derived impurities, which ultimately results in a reduced number of subsequent centrifugal and chromatography purification steps. In laboratory-scale purifications, further VLP purification by ultracentrifugation in CsCl or sucrose gradients is often sufficient to obtain suitable preparations for subsequent applications, especially when successive rounds of low-and high-speed centrifugations are applied. In industrial-scale processes, the use of ultracentrifugation has some restrictions due to the risk of VLP aggregation, the lack of scalability, and the enhancement of labor intensity [52] . Thus, instead of using ultracentrifugation, the necessary purity of VLPs is often achieved through special chromatographic processes. Depending on the properties of the VLP, different size-exclusion, ion exchange, and affinity columns are used in the purification process. However, additional steps, such as the treatment of the VLP solution with diatomic earth before the column chromatography, may be necessary to achieve the desired vaccine-grade purity level, as demonstrated with the production of HBsAg in Pichia [82] .\n",
            " The purification schemes not only include the removal of host or target product-derived impurities from VLPs. In special cases, to improve the functional properties of the target VLPs, a disassembly/reassembly stage is necessary. For example, reassembled human papilloma VLPs exhibit enhanced immunoreactivity and stability properties [83] .\n",
            " It is necessary to emphasize the methods that allow the identification of the VLP during the initial stages of construction. Different VLP properties can be useful for early detection and screening, and the methods partially overlap with those used in the purification. The application of PEG or ammonium sulfate, which have the ability to bind water molecules, until the solubility level of the VLP is exceeded can be used to precipitate high-molecular VLPs and leave the low-molecular impurities in the extract solution [84] . The purity of the precipitate is usually sufficient for simple downstream analysis to identify the VLP structural proteins by SDS/PAGE, agarose gel retardation tests of proteinnucleic acid complexes, which are typically used for VLPs [36, 85] , and sucrose gradient and size-exclusion chromatography for demonstrations of the high-molecular state of the VLPs [86] . Alternatively, if the precipitation conditions can disassemble the particles, the VLP-containing extracts can be directly concentrated by ultracentrifugation. If mono-or polyclonal antibodies against corresponding native virus or VLPs are available, additional proofs of the VLP formation can be obtained using ELISA, Western blots [87] , and immune diffusion tests as Ouchterlony's double radial immune diffusion in agarose [38] . An electron microscopy analysis is necessary as a final visual proof of the new synthesized VLPs because above-mentioned indirect tests may identify large, unstructured protein aggregates as VLPs.\n",
            " After purification, the different properties of the target VLPs have to be tested to demonstrate their accordance with the indented downstream applications. A valuable tool in the analysis of the VLP composition is mass spectrometry, which allows the measurement of the molecular mass of the assembled proteins. This technique has been used to identify proteolytically degraded [27] or post-translationally modified [44] proteins in the VLP structure. In the analysis of the glycosylation pattern of mammalian VLPs, the lectin-based glycan differentiation assay is a useful and rapid method for the identification of structural protein modifications [88] . The structural integrity of the VLPs can also be demonstrated by trypsin treatments in the presence or absence of detergents that are capable of dissociating the VLP-forming subunits [88] .\n",
            " Different VLP physical parameters are significant factors in the development of new identification methods and applications. The VLP concentration measurements can be complicated due to the protein/nucleic acid content of the particles. Nevertheless, simple but accurate concentration measurements based on UV spectra are available for the plant virus BMV and HBcAg VLPs; these are also applicable for other viruses and VLPs [89] . In addition, isoelectric point measurements by capillary isoelectric focusing have been found to be useful in the differentiation of the VLPs from different norovirus genogroups [90] .\n",
            " In complicated cases, immune and electron cryomicroscopy images can provide the necessary proof of the correctness of the constructed VLPs. Immunoelectron microscopy using colloidal gold that is conjugated to the antibodies has been widely used in VLP research and has been found to be necessary for the visualization and localization of antigens on the VLP surface. Electron cryomicroscopy provides images with comparably high resolution and has been used in a number of cases, including bluetongue [91] , HIV-1 [92] , HCV [93] , CHIKV [94] , and other VLPs. This method is also useful for the visualization of the displayed foreign peptides on the VLP surface [95] . More detailed information on electron microscopy and additional examples can be found in other review articles [96, 97] . Crystallization and subsequent X-ray structure analysis is usually applied for further resolution characterization of the VLP properties. VLPs are also used in cases in which the corresponding native viruses are not available in preparative amounts and in stepwise virus assembly studies [98] [99] [100] [101] .\n",
            " Because VLPs are mostly produced for different downstream applications, the stability of the recombinant particles is one of the most significant issues. Another important reason to perform stability experiments is the necessary determination of the conditions that support the disassembly of the particles for subsequent reassembly and packaging of the foreign agents, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and low-molecular mass compounds. To obtain data on their stability, the purified VLPs are incubated in different buffer solutions and/or at elevated temperatures. One of the most popular methods that demonstrates the influence of the incubation conditions on the VLP structure is the above-mentioned native agarose gel analysis, which was used with the plant virus CCMV and the RNA bacteriophages Cb5, MS2, and PRR1 [36, 98, 99] . However, this method is only applicable when the VLPs contain nucleic acids and when the dimensions of the VLP are compatible with agarose gel analysis. For filamentous or empty VLPs, other methods can be appropriate, such as various spectroscopic techniques, which were used with Norwalk VLPs [102] , and the detection of the appearance of lowmolecular structures through the separation of the samples by ultracentrifugation [27] . In the case of norovirus, the mechanical stability of the corresponding VLPs was tested by atomic force microscopy [103] . For high-throughput analyses, the structural changes in the VLPs at elevated temperatures are monitored in the presence of Sypro-Orange dye using a real-time PCR system and a DNA melting point determination program [27] . In some cases, the results of the stability studies should be corrected by electron microscopy visualizations, as was necessary for the hybrid rod-like VLPs of the bacteriophages GA and fr [104] .\n",
            " If the conventional expression system does not insure the production of oxidized VLPs, the stability of the VLPs can be considerably enhanced through the introduction of disulfide bridges to crosslink the individual structural proteins with hydrogen peroxide in the cell-free system. As a result, disulfide bridges-containing Qb VLPs can withstand temperatures of up to 75°C, whereas reduced VLPs are only stable at a temperature of approximately 45°C [77] . Simple additives can also enhance the VLP stability. From vaccine formulation studies, it is known that the addition of additives, such as polysorbate, sorbitol, and disaccharide trehalose, effectively prevents VLP aggregation [105, 106] .\n",
            " Viral structural proteins are typical nucleic acid-binding proteins. Numerous studies demonstrate the ability of recombinant VLPs to bind and encapsidate nucleic acids that are present in the host cells, such as the mRNA of the transgene, ribosomal and/or transport RNAs [88, [107] [108] [109] . In some cases, the mRNA of the cloned gene is not found in the VLPs [30] . DNA microarray experiments suggest that CCMV VLPs, along with its own mRNA, are capable of encapsidating a large number of Pseudomonas mRNAs, except for the ribosomal RNA, which is the most abundant cell RNA [36] . As was found in the case of FHV through the use of a next-generation sequencing technique, VLPs mostly encapsidate ribosomal RNA and the transcripts from the introduced baculovirus expression vectors. Interestingly, native FHV virions also exhibit the ability to package host RNAs, although these particles package only approximately 1 % of the total amount [110] . To identify the RNA secondary structures that are responsible for the encapsidation process, the SELEX system was recently developed for nucleic acid-binding tests with the plant virus STNV VLPs. After 10 rounds of selection, no single RNA stem loop was identified as a potential VLP assembly initiation site; instead, eight different secondary structures in the SNTV genome partially corresponded to the consensus sequence found by the SELEX method [111] . These data suggest a possible mechanism for host nucleic acid encapsidation in the recombinant VLPs: if the transcriptoma of the heterologous host with the cloned viral structural gene contains RNA(s) with the necessary secondary structures in sufficient amounts, these can serve as factors that stimulate or even initiate the VLP formation.\n",
            " In many cases, the construction of VLPs is tightly bound with the aim to obtain structured multimeric protein assemblies with specific properties for subsequent applications. In the case of a successful construction, VLPs are to some extent ''universal,'' e.g., useful for different purposes with the same or a similar principle of action, which is highly important for the development of the technology platform. In this section, the examples of VLPs with noticeable universal properties are discussed.\n",
            " First, VLPs can be used for different purposes based on their intrinsic properties without any changes to the structural proteins. Mammalian VLPs recognize cells from the corresponding organism and are able to deliver cargo, such as therapeutic nucleic acids or proteins, to the recipient organism [112, 113] . The ability to bind specific nucleic acids is common for viral structural proteins and is used for the binding and encapsidation of other negatively charged substances, such as oligonucleotides and biological and chemical polymers, as shown with the recombinant HBcAg, Qb, and CCMV VLPs [114] [115] [116] . This binding property seems to be universal. However, the packaging is limited by the size of the negatively charged polymer. This limitation is apparently bound by the internal volume of the corresponding VLPs and the availability of positively charged AAs in the VLP structure. Therefore, the polyomavirus JC VLPs, which are gene therapy vector candidates, are able to package different plasmid DNAs in sizes that exceed 9 kbp but not 14.5 kbp during the cultivation of E. coli cells [117] .\n",
            " In addition to the packaging, VLP intrinsic properties, such as surface-located AA regions, can serve as targets for the introduction of various functional molecules. There are two general methods for introducing molecules into the carrier VLPs: chemical coupling and genetic fusion. In the chemical coupling process, any method that is known to modify a protein can be used provided that the conditions of the reaction preserve the structural integrity of the VLPs. In most cases, the surface-located lysine residues are targets for coupling [118] , although other AAs, such as cysteine, tyrosine, aspartic, and glutamic acids, can also be modified [13] . Some VLPs are shown to possess nearly universal properties for chemical conjugation; one of the best-studied VLPs with this property is the plant virus CPMV [119] . Other VLPs, such as those derived from the bacteriophages Qb and AP205 have been validated for the coupling of different antigens, including low-molecular substances, such as nicotine and whole proteins, with the aim to obtain prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines [120] [121] [122] [123] .\n",
            " For VLPs without reactive AAs on the surface, the necessary universality can be achieved by targeted mutagenesis, as shown in the case of TMV. After the incorporation of an accessible lysine residue, the subsequent coupling of biotin moieties to the virus enabled the tight binding of 2,200 molecules of recombinant streptavidin-containing model protein per viral particle [124] . The introduction of AAs such as cysteine to some VLPs has been found to be useful for the subsequent coupling and multivalent display of ligands [125] .\n",
            " Genetic methods have been widely used for the introduction of different peptides, including immunologically relevant epitopes, to the VLP structure [1] . In addition, the introduction of specific peptides can contribute to the broadening of the potential VLP applications. Recently, the heterodimeric coiled-coil AA motifs were found to be useful for the packaging of different proteins in the VLP interior without chemical coupling or genetic fusions [126, 127] . The interaction between the coiled-coil motif-containing CCMV CP and the protein of interest insured a strong binding between the two components, which allowed the encapsidation of up to 14 molecules of the model protein inside the 28 nm CCMV particle.\n",
            " The introduction of a whole protein into the VLP structure can also be achieved by genetic fusion, especially in the case of larger VLPs [112, 128] . A versatile system called SplitCore was recently developed for the HBcAg VLPs [129] . The splitting of the HBcAg gene at the encoded immunodominant region into two parts and the expression of both fragments in E. coli retained the ability of VLP formation. This system allows the display of several proteins of medicinal relevance, which have sizes of more than 300 AA, on the VLP surface. This splitting principle is also applicable to other VLPs [129] .\n",
            " Another interesting development that has made VLPs suitable for different applications is the incorporation of protein A-derived domains in the particle structure. These domains are known to effectively bind to the constant regions of the antibody molecules (IgG) of different organisms. After displaying this domain on the particle surface, the VLPs are able to bind up to 2 g of IgG per 1 g of carrier [130] , which offers a simple procedure for the purification of different monoclonal antibodies. VLPs with protein A domains and bound antibodies can also be used for the addressed delivery of therapeutic nucleic acid to specific cells [131] or as sensitive diagnostic agents [132] . Other examples of multifunctional VLPs for protein delivery can be found in a recent review [133] .\n",
            " The latest metagenomic evaluations suggest that virologists are using less than 1 % of the existing viral diversity [134] . Therefore, the environmental samples represent an inexhaustible source of new viral structural genes, from which new VLPs with defined properties can be constructed. However, the construction process of new VLPs is still expensive and labor-intensive. The use of mammalian expression systems is acceptable for the construction of structurally complicated VLPs, particularly if the introduction of the correct post-translational modifications and/ or the production of VLPs that contain multiple structural proteins are necessary. As confirmed by numerous experiments, insect and yeast cell systems can be an effective alternative to mammalian hosts. However, when the construction of a new VLP is considered, E. coli hosts should first be tested because these hosts have lower costs and require a shorter construction time. Due to the absence of generally applicable, rapid screening methods and the inefficiency of in silico predictions, the only approach that can be used to construct new and modify existing VLPs is the trial and error method with subsequent visual confirmation by electron microscopy [135] .\n",
            " Taking into account the advances in vaccine development, VLPs have a positive reputation as systems of academic, industrial, and commercial significance and are no longer only ''mere laboratory curiosities'' [14] . However, in some fields, such as gene therapy and nanomaterials, the potential VLP application technologies are based only on laboratory experiments. The study of the most perspective VLP-based objects and applications must be continued to demonstrate the predictability, sustainability, and cost efficiency of this technology.\n",

            "Title: Solid-State NMR for Studying the Structure and Dynamics of Viral Assemblies\n",
            "Body Text: Solid-state NMR is a structural biology approach that can provide unique information about the molecular assemblies used by viruses to enter host cells, to establish infection and to ensure that progeny virions are released into the environment. Solid-state NMR can contribute to an understanding of how viral proteins and their assemblies function from a structural point of view, revealing weak spots which can be targeted to fight infection through antiviral therapies or vaccines. Solid-state NMR is in this respect complementary to solution NMR, X-ray crystallography and electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), the other atomic-resolution structural biology methods. All can provide images of proteins at resolutions on the order of 1-10 Å. Considering large assemblies, X-ray crystallography was the first approach used to resolve viral capsid and envelope structures at high resolution, and was pioneered by Michael Rossmann and Stephen C. Harrison on plant viruses [1, 2] , owing to the enormous numbers of progeny viruses per cell that plants produce. Advances in recombinant DNA as well as cell culture technology opened the way to mammalian viruses [3, 4] . This approach has subsequently revealed a wide variety of capsid structures, amongst them capsids from rhinovirus [5] , poliovirus [6] and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [7] , as other early examples of human pathogens. The typical resolution of the structures is around 2-3 Å, but a higher resolution below 1.5 Å has been reached for several viruses (see www.pdb.org). For X-ray structures, at 2.5 Å, the backbone is well-defined and many, though not all, sidechains are visible; at 1.5 Å, most sidechains are well-defined (and in the correct rotameric state) The anisotropic interactions can be averaged out using MAS, which results in a single resonance line centered at the isotropic chemical shift of the spin. In addition, spinning sidebands may appear. This spin can be correlated to a neighboring spin, in the example, the amide 1 H to the amide 15 N. Twodimensional spectroscopy then shows peaks which represent, for the present example, the amide proton frequency in one dimension, and the nitrogen frequency in the other. Such a signal will be observed for every NH pair in the protein. The resonance-line position is given by the isotropic part of NMR chemical shift and is usually specified in ppm (parts per million) of the resonance frequency. To obtain high-resolution spectra, the linewidth should be as narrow as possible, as this allows to distinguish (resolve) a maximum of resonances. A narrowing of linewidths can be achieved by (i) using a spectrometer operating at a higher magnetic field, (ii) improving sample homogeneity and symmetry, and (iii) reducing the dipolar coupling interactions by decreasing the density of protons in the system (through protein deuteration, for example) and/or increasing the MAS frequency by using smaller diameter rotors.\n",
            " Solid-state NMR is thus a technique which can address structure and detailed conformation of proteins which are \"not soluble\". This term must be understood in the broader sense, often simply meaning that they are involved in molecular interactions leading to larger superstructures, either with lipids for membrane proteins, or with each other, as in molecular assemblies such as molecular The anisotropic interactions can be averaged out using MAS, which results in a single resonance line centered at the isotropic chemical shift of the spin. In addition, spinning sidebands may appear. This spin can be correlated to a neighboring spin, in the example, the amide 1 H to the amide 15 N. Two-dimensional spectroscopy then shows peaks which represent, for the present example, the amide proton frequency in one dimension, and the nitrogen frequency in the other. Such a signal will be observed for every NH pair in the protein. The resonance-line position is given by the isotropic part of NMR chemical shift and is usually specified in ppm (parts per million) of the resonance frequency. To obtain high-resolution spectra, the linewidth should be as narrow as possible, as this allows to distinguish (resolve) a maximum of resonances. A narrowing of linewidths can be achieved by (i) using a spectrometer operating at a higher magnetic field, (ii) improving sample homogeneity and symmetry, and (iii) reducing the dipolar coupling interactions by decreasing the density of protons in the system (through protein deuteration, for example) and/or increasing the MAS frequency by using smaller diameter rotors.\n",
            " Still, the solid-state linewidth is typically somewhat broader than in solution-state NMR, which results in a higher spectral crowding than in solution, and limits the protein size to be investigated. Thus, further improvements in MAS frequency (>100 kHz [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] ) and magnetic field strength (>800 MHz or 18.8 Tesla; note that magnetic field strength is conventionally expressed in units of the proton resonance frequency) will be important for the study of larger proteins. Typically, going from 800 MHz to 1.2 GHz increases the signal-to-noise ratio by nearly a factor of 2. But already today, the combination of 100 kHz MAS, high magnetic fields (>800 MHz) ( Figure 1 ) and improved sample preparation, e.g., by direct sedimentation [37, 38] , allows for high-resolution spectroscopy of large biomolecular assemblies like viral capsids or envelopes [35, [39] [40] [41] if they show high local symmetry. If the protein-monomers forming the assemblies are structurally diverse, this results in the observation of multiple sets of NMR signals (see also below), and increases spectral crowding or line widths if the splittings are unresolved. Solid-state NMR is thus a technique which can address structure and detailed conformation of proteins which are \"not soluble\". This term must be understood in the broader sense, often simply meaning that they are involved in molecular interactions leading to larger superstructures, either with lipids for membrane proteins, or with each other, as in molecular assemblies such as molecular machines, protein fibrils, viral capsids or envelopes. \"Solid\" in this context means that the proteins do not show fast enough molecular tumbling (with correlation times of tens of nanoseconds) to be addressed by solution-state NMR. In a first approximation, therefore, the most attractive targets for solid-state NMR are large assemblies of many relatively small subunits, the latter being important to avoid excessive signal overlap in the spectra.\n",
            " As mentioned, an additional important feature of solid-state NMR is its ability to characterize dynamic processes by observing relaxation times and exchange effects [42] . For an NMR spectroscopist, dynamics is usually associated with a timescale (the correlation time) and an amplitude (the order parameter), while structural virology dynamics is more associated with the volume of the conformational space for the protein. Dynamics on the pico-and nanosecond timescale (backbone and sidechain motion) can be characterized by relaxation measurements, while microsecond dynamics often leads to very efficient relaxation. In solid-state NMR spectra, dynamic entities (often loops but sometimes entire domains) may completely vanish from the spectrum as a consequence of such dynamics [43] . While limiting the possibilities for structure determination, the ability to assign a defined range of motional timescale to the corresponding residues provides valuable dynamic information.\n",
            " As in solution-state NMR, the chemical shifts in MAS solid-state NMR give a fingerprint of a protein, which can be used to easily assess structural differences arising, for example, in the presence of interactants. This is of central importance in viral proteins, which often show multiple functions and thus also interactions, during which they change conformation to adapt to the specific role they need to fulfill at a specific point in the viral life cycle.\n",
            " A major challenge, as for all structural techniques, is the isolation of appropriate virus-like or capsid-like particles (VLPs and CLPs, respectively) from cell culture, or to in-vitro reconstruct the viral protein and its interactants one seeks to investigate. As most solid-state NMR approaches rely on the availability of stable-isotope-labeled protein preparations ( 2 H, 13 C, 15 N) [44] , isolation of VLPs or CLPs is often impractical; for HBV capsids, for instance, this would require large-scale cultures of HBV-producing human hepatoma cells growing on isotope-labeled medium, and efficient separation methods. For bacterial viruses, this is much less challenging, and solid-state NMR has successfully been used to investigate Pf1 bacteriophages directly as sediments from ultracentrifugation [45, 46] . However, the phage structure is composed mainly of a single protein, and the viral genome is difficult to observe under standard conditions. The DNA signals could be assigned using selective unlabeling of the protein [47, 48] or dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) [49, 50] , a technique providing signal intensity enhancement using transfer polarization from unpaired electron spins to nuclear spins at low temperatures (typically 100 K) although at the cost of limited spectral resolution (for a review on DNP see [51] ).\n",
            " Another limitation for the investigation of authentic viral particles directly by solid-state NMR is that, while biosafe probes have been designed for the investigation of amyloid proteins [52] , they do not reach the safety provided by a biosafety level 3 laboratory often needed for the study of infectious material.\n",
            " Another challenge is to obtain the amounts of material needed for NMR structural analysis. Until recently, solid-state NMR samples routinely comprised >20 mg of pure protein. With the advent of advanced proton-detection fast MAS techniques, proteins can now be analyzed in 0.7 mm and even 0.5 mm rotors which reach over 150 kHz MAS frequencies (Figure 1a) , yielding well-resolved Viruses 2020, 12, 1069 6 of 26 proton-nitrogen correlation spectra [29, [34] [35] [36] 53] . The concomitant reduction in sample sizes to the sub-milligram level enables the use of alternative production techniques to bacterial expression. Still, several hundred micrograms of pure protein are usually required, and the isolation of sufficient amounts of authentic viruses, moreover in a single, defined maturation state, would require truly large-scale mammalian cell cultures; complexity in vivo is often further increased by dynamic modifications such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events.\n",
            " Hence NMR specimens are typically not entire virions from patients or cell culture, but rather recombinant purified proteins, or their assembly products such as capsids or envelopes, typically around 500 µg per sample, which are centrifuged directly out of a liquid phase as a sediment into the NMR rotor ( Figure 1a ). This technique yields good-quality spectra [37, 38] and usually keeps the samples stable and hydrated for months if not years [54] . NMR experiments are usually performed near room temperature (−10 • C to 40 • C).\n",
            " 3.2. The Size of the Proteins and Their Assemblies Amenable to \"High Resolution\" Solid-State NMR Solid-state NMR has a strength for assemblies that are large but consist of small, optimally identical, repeating units, as is true for many viral capsids and envelopes. Indeed, only a single set of signals is expected for a core protein, even if many equivalent copies (hundreds for helical symmetry, 60 for T = 3 and T = 4 icosahedral symmetry) make up the viral capsid under investigation. If there are N non-equivalent monomers in the unit cell, N peaks may be observed per nucleus, depending on the conformational differences. If they are sizeable, the different peaks are resolved; if they are smaller, they may lead to line broadening or have no effect. While these effects add to the information contents of the spectra [55] (see also below), they also increase spectral overlap, which can be detrimental for large proteins. Solid-state NMR does not require long-range order of the biological assembly, as long as the monomeric subunits feature a similar chemical environment at the atomic level. More complex assemblies containing larger and/or more different proteins however become increasingly difficult to study in native forms, since the complexity of NMR spectra increases with the sheer number of amino-acid residues present. Although solid-state NMR does not have the intrinsic size limitations of liquid-state NMR, where larger proteins give ever broader NMR lines, spectral overlap complicates analysis, such that objects of more than~500 inequivalent amino acids are difficult to resolve.\n",
            " An important point to be considered is that most NMR techniques rely on labeling of the proteins with NMR-active stable isotopes such as 13 C and 15 N, in some cases also 2 H ( 2 H is an NMR-active nucleus with spin 1, but is here not detected; rather it dilutes the dense 1 H network to further reduce the distance-dependent 1 H-1 H dipolar couplings, in order to further narrow 1 H lines). Stable isotope labeling can indeed be achieved in mammalian cell cultures [56] , but at larger scales (see above) this rapidly becomes very costly, and is thus best achieved by employing high-yield systems for protein production.\n",
            " As a result, solid-state NMR of viral proteins relies largely on recombinantly produced material, which under appropriate conditions can be a valid, high homogeneity model, as is often confirmed by EM and X-ray crystallography. E. coli expression is the major workhorse here, offering straightforward isotope labeling of proteins. Genuine E. coli toolboxes have been developed for several viruses, able to produce assemblies mimicking defined in vivo states, e.g., residue-specific phosphorylation (for example [57] ) thus allowing the exploration of the conformational space of viral proteins. As demands in sample quantity are diminishing (see above), other production approaches have recently been developed, and a highly attractive compromise between expression in eukaryotic cells vs. E. coli is the use of eukaryotic cell-free systems, optimally one that combines high expression yields with an increased folding capacity and access to a range of post-translational modifications [58] . One such system is based on wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis (WG-CFPS) [40, 41, 59, 60] . The high efficiency and selectivity of isotopic labeling constitutes a major asset of this system for NMR studies. Importantly, and in contrast to cell-based production, only the protein of interest is isotopically labeled [61] , enabling sample preparation without extensive purification. This is of particular interest, for example, for the study of ribonucleoprotein complexes which form directly during the cell-free synthesis reaction. In addition, metabolic scrambling of labels between different amino acids is much lower than in E. coli, and can further be minimized by using transaminase inhibitors and glutamine synthase inhibitors [62, 63] . WG-CFPS is particularly attractive for deuteration, often used to reduce proton linewidths [64, 65] , as in contrast to bacterial expression it does not require proton back-exchange, circumventing denaturation and refolding steps which could compromise the native folding of proteins. WG-CFPS indeed allows for the simple addition of deuterated amino acids to the translation reaction performed in H 2 O medium. Selective labeling, by adding only the desired labeled amino acid to the translation reaction, can efficiently be performed in WG-CFPS [59, 62, 63, 66] , and help to significantly reduce the complexity of NMR spectra, as shown, for instance, by the successful application to the NS4B protein of hepatitis C virus [60] (see below). Another complexity-reducing approach is segmental labeling, whereby only part of a protein sequence is isotopically labeled while the remaining parts remain invisible. This was successfully applied to HIV-1 in tubular assemblies [67] and in spherical CLPs formed by the capsid protein [68] . Other schemes can be used, with those where only one partner is labeled particularly relevant for interaction studies, where the non-isotopically-labeled partner(s) remain(s) invisible, and all information on changes is contained in the target protein spectra [69] . Alternatively, labeling protocols using selectively 13 C-labeled glucose (1-13 C or 2-13 C) as a carbon source during protein expression [70] can be used to improve spectral resolution and determine intermolecular restraints, as demonstrated on molecular machines such as the type III secretion system needle [71] . This technique has not yet been employed for viral assemblies but could be useful to study contacts between capsids subunits.\n",
            " High sample purity is required to reach maximal NMR signal strength, yet low-level contaminants (<5-10% of the total sample) will typically be invisible in the NMR spectra.\n",
            " Once the proteins are labeled, 2D and 3D NMR spectra are recorded at an MAS frequency that depends on the rotor size used (typically 17 kHz for 3.2 mm rotors to 100 kHz for 0.7 mm ones). In multi-dimensional spectra, each dimension corresponds to the recording of an 1 H, 15 N or 13 C magnetization's free induction decay over time, which is then Fourier-transformed in order to yield a frequency-domain spectrum, ideally containing a peak for each 1 H, 15 N or 13 C nucleus in the protein.\n",
            " Multi-dimensional spectra help to resolve overlap which would be very high in one-dimensional spectra. In these spectra, a residue is characterized by a \"douple\" and triple of resonance frequencies in the 2 or 3 dimensions, respectively, e.g., 15 N, 13 CA, 13 CO intra-residual correlations. A combination of those nuclei with 3D spectra enables to create inter-residual connections by correlating, for example, the 15 N of one residue with the 13 CO/ 13 CA of the preceding one. Such schemes thus connect the amide 15 N to both directions of the protein backbone, and allow for sequential resonance assignments [53, [72] [73] [74] [75] . This eventually enables to associate an NMR signal or frequency to every atom in the protein.\n",
            " Once the NMR fingerprint is assigned (i.e., all signals and thus frequencies in the spectra are assigned to a nucleus), it is easy to follow conformational changes induced by the addition of a ligand or any other event, by simply following the chemical-shift differences and localizing them on a known 3D structure. Important examples are protein-nucleic acid complexes, where structural changes can in principle even be followed via the chemical shifts from both sides. Protein and RNA or DNA can either be labeled at the same time, e.g., when preparing a viral capsid in E. coli in media containing labeled amino acids and nucleic-acid building blocks, or be labeled separately if one can reassemble the capsid in vitro with labeled or unlabeled RNA, as it is the case for HBV capsids [76] .\n",
            " Protein structure determination by solid-state NMR involves combining dihedral angle restraints derived from chemical shifts [77] with distance restraints derived from dipolar couplings. These restraints can then be used to computationally find a solution that fulfills as many of them as possible. The detailed outcome of this optimization depends on the initial condition [78] [79] [80] . The best solutions constitute the NMR \"bundle\", which characterizes the possible range of conformations for the protein. Due to signal overlap, de novo structure determination from solid-state NMR data is currently limited to proteins of up to about 200 amino acids in length. Only a few viral protein structures have been determined de novo using solid-state NMR today.\n",
            " NMR can efficiently assess interactions with small molecules, which is extensively used in drug screening by solution NMR [81, 82] . For solid-state NMR, high-throughput screening is not yet routinely available, but first compatible sample changers have been developed. Screening can thus be done, though with limited efficiency, providing access to the rich information of NMR chemical shifts and allowing a detailed analysis of interactions with small molecules by similar approaches as in solution. A particular strength of solid-state NMR in such applications is the availability of side-chain information directly from 2D 13 C correlation spectra, which indicates which 13 C nuclei are spatially nearby the interacting site.\n",
            " Some of the first viral targets in MAS solid-state NMR were bacteriophages, serving as relatively simple model systems for NMR methods development. Major advantages were their often small coat proteins, which can be readily prepared in stable-isotope-labeled form, and the absence of an envelope, presenting a system containing just one principal structural element (reviewed by [83] and more recently by [84] ). Studies of intact filamentous bacteriophages were described recently [50] . In parallel, solid-state NMR on membrane proteins progressed further, first on oriented samples [85] and then by MAS methods, and the study of small viral membrane peptides set the stage for the emerging analyses of much more complex samples such as membrane proteins from human viruses. Figure 2 shows a selection of human viruses and their proteins studied by solid-state NMR today (with red labels), aiming to gain an insight into their dynamics and structure, and their interactions with viral genomes as well as cellular membranes.\n",
            " Several studies have addressed the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), with an emphasis on the capsid and gp41 fusion proteins ( Figure 2a ). Influenza virus, notably its M2 ion channel, has been the topic of several studies (Figure 2b ), studies on measles virus nucleocapsids have also been initiated (Figure 2c ), and more recently hepatitis B virus (HBV) proteins, both from the duck HBV model and the human virus (Figure 2d ), have been addressed. In addition, non-structural membrane proteins from the hepatitis C virus (HCV), such as the p7 ion channel and NS4B, are challenging current subjects (Figure 2e ). Below we summarize first the successes and then the remaining challenges, with a focus on proteins from pathogenic human viruses. \n",
            " Viral capsids are superstructures formed by core protein(s) in complex with the viral genome. They usually represent assemblies with high local symmetries, often icosahedral, but they can also have irregular shapes. Their obvious function is to protect the viral genome, but they have often multiple roles in the viral life cycle. To fulfill these diverse functions, e.g., intracellular transport and trafficking, entry and egress from the host cell, they have structures that can change over time and on demand. Their overall shapes can best be addressed by cryo-EM, but the dynamics of their functional domains let them frequently escape detection by this method. Similarly, structural details can go undetected, since even the resolution achievable nowadays may be insufficient to clearly pinpoint subtle changes between states.\n",

The viral capsid comprises 1500 copies of the 26 kDa capsid protein (CA) and forms a characteristic cone-shaped cage around two copies of the viral genomic RNA (Figure 2a) . The structural organization of the mature capsid was defined as a \"fullerene cone\" based on cryo-EM images [88] (Figure 3a,b) .

In a similar approach, Polenova and coworkers identified the interaction of CA with the host protein Cyclophilin A (CypA), which regulates HIV-1 viral infectivity through direct interactions with the viral capsid. 1 H-15 N and 1 H-13 C dipolar tensors and NMR peak intensities revealed that dynamics on the microsecond-to-nanosecond timescale in the CypA binding loop are important for HIV-1 s escape from CypA dependence [93] (again, the dipolar interaction is described by a second rank tensor, which is normally averaged but can be re-introduced to reveal dynamic averaging).

            " The HBV core protein has been accessible in recombinant form from early on, and its structure has been extensively investigated by EM and X-ray approaches [7, 14, [100] [101] [102] . Still, it needed advanced biochemistry to develop expression systems adequate for the production of the full-length form, Cp183 [76] , which in contrast to the truncated Cp149 used in most structural studies, packs nucleic acids. The HBV capsid structure is dynamic, and is believed to change/adapt according to the different roles the protein has at different points in its viral life cycle. Its main function is to serve as the building block of the nucleocapsid shell surrounding the pgRNA and viral polymerase. Cp expressed in bacteria assembles into icosahedral particles closely resembling those seen in infected liver [101] . The predominant icosahedral T = 4 capsid contains 240 copies of Cp in 120 dimeric subunits, and comprises four groups of symmetrically non-equivalent subunits arranged as 60 AB and CD homodimers (Figure 3e ). The 20 kDa core protein contains an N-terminal domain of 140 residues, required for the assembly into capsid, joined by a 9-residues linker to an arginine-rich C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 150 to 183) responsible for several essential functions, including pgRNA binding [103] . The dynamic structure of the CTD and its interactions with the viral RNA remains one of the blind spots in capsid investigations today. Furthermore, the hypothesized conformational changes of the capsid believed to signal readiness for envelopment [104] , or alternatively the predicted single-strand blocking signal [105] , have escaped detection as of today.\n",
            " The HBV capsid has recently been subject to solid-state NMR studies on capsids isolated from E. coli cells where they auto-assemble (Figure 3f ). The sequential 1 H/ 13 C/ 15 N assignments have been established as a basis for further studies [35, 106] . The NMR spectra yielded high-resolution NMR fingerprints (Figure 3g) , with linewidths similar to those obtained from the HIV capsids, confirming that this type of symmetrical object is well in the scope of solid-state NMR. A comparison between the chemical shifts of the core protein in its dimeric and capsid states revealed the residues which structurally adapt upon shell assembly [106] . The slight non-symmetry (\"quasiequivalence\") between the four subunits was reflected in the NMR spectra [55] , in which multiple peaks are observed for~20% of residues located at the dimer-dimer interfaces at the five-and six-fold symmetry axes (Figure 3g,h) , as shown at the example of Ala137. Hence the high sensitivity of NMR chemical-shifts to structural variations allowed the exact pinpointing of the residues where subtle local conformational adaptations are needed for lattice formation, i.e., the molecular hinges [55] .\n",
            " As described above, the development of proton-detected fast MAS NMR spectroscopy beyond 100 kHz sample rotation has recently made it possible to study sub-milligram amounts of protein samples, and enabled proton assignments of HBV Cp, using less than 500 µg of capsids [35] . With the proton resonances assigned, this approach can now be used for further interaction studies, with cellular partners that are available in small quantities, as well as with antivirals like the capsid assembly modulators (CAMs, also called core protein allosteric modulators, CpAMs). CAMs are currently under pharmaceutical development for targeting viral nucleocapsid assembly [107, 108] ; they act by either promoting assembly of regularly appearing but genome-less capsids, or they induce the formation of aberrantly shaped irregular multimers, which are not functional in viral replication; notably, recent data suggest that this distinction is not always strict in that the concentration of a compound and the time it is in contact can affect the morphological outcome [109] . In this context, the use of cell-free synthesis systems for sample preparation is particularly interesting as assembly modulators can act directly on the capsid protein exiting from the ribosome, and hence in a preassembly state. The sub-milligram Cp183 capsids obtained through cell-free protein synthesis are fully sufficient for the smaller sample requirements of fast MAS NMR, and they can simply be sedimented into a 0.7 mm NMR rotor after purification on a sucrose gradient (Figure 4a ) [40] . The capsids directly pack nucleic acids during cell-free synthesis, and only the full-length protein successfully assembles in the system. In the presence of a heteroaryldihydropyrimidine (HAP) CAM, the cell-free Cp183 capsids opened up completely (Figure 4b ) [40] , indicating suitability of this system for solid-state NMR analysis. These data show how the combination of WG-CFPS and solid-state NMR can open the way for a better understanding of the action of CAMs under conditions that more closely mimic the situation in a cell.\n",

Their structure remains difficult to access, as they often only exist in multimeric forms, or even keep their native structure exclusively in the assembled envelope. As bacterial expression is most often not possible, alternative expression methods have been developed. An interesting and medically relevant example are recombinant HBV subviral particles (SVPs) comprising just the small envelope protein S, which can efficiently be produced in yeast and serves as the active constituent of the HBV vaccine. During HBV infection, similar non-infectious SVPs, containing all three envelope proteins and host phospholipids, are secreted by infected cells in huge excess over virions [113, 114] . Yeast expression of the SVPs is not compatible with NMR analyses, since isotope labeling is too costly as 13 C methanol must also be fed during the long maturation steps. It has been shown early-on that the small HBV envelope protein (HBsS) can assemble in the wheat-germ cell-free system [115] . This system was recently used to assemble SVPs from the S envelope protein of the related duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) [41] (Figure 6a,b) , in a similar manner to the HBV capsids [40] (Figure 4a,b) . The addition of mild detergent allowed for the production of milligram amounts of these integral membrane protein assemblies, and a simple sedimentation after sucrose gradient isolation enabled NMR sample preparation [41] . The SVPs showed a rather narrow distribution of diameters, close to those formed during HBV infection [116] , and similar antigenic properties as SVPs isolated from DHBV-infected ducks. First two-dimensional 1 H-15 N solid-state NMR hNH spectra showed a number of isolated peaks with linewidths comparable with model membrane proteins (Figure 6a) .

In both cases, solid-state NMR was compared to solution-state NMR data obtained in micelles, and Opella and coworkers first identified the localization of the transmembrane domains of p7 and Vpu in lipid bilayers. Unfortunately, the full p7 structure in lipids could not yet be solved, as this would help to resolve contrasting data between different detergent-based solution NMR studies [145] [146] [147] [148] [149] ; the membrane might actually play a central role in determining p7 structure and oligomerization.\n",
            " Another HCV protein on which studies in lipids are underway is the nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B). NS4B is a 27 kDa alpha-helical integral membrane protein of 261 amino acid residues. While the NS4B 3D structure has not been solved yet, a topology model is available [150] ; it proposes that membrane association of NS4B is mediated by both transmembrane domains in its central parts, and determinants for membrane association in the N-and C-terminal regions [151] . However, given its important role for HCV, the need for more detailed structural information on NS4B is evident. A solid-state NMR study combined with molecular dynamic calculations looked at the second amphipathic helix of NS4B (AH2), known to promote remodeling events that are essential in viral replication [152] . Using a synthetic peptide reconstituted into lipids, the authors showed that AH2 promotes the clustering of negatively charged lipids within the bilayer, facilitating the remodeling of the latter, and increasing the disassociation of AH2 oligomers. Yet, insight into the multiple functions of NS4B which might be governed by distinct membrane topologies and/or interactions with other viral and cellular proteins [151] would be greatly supported by detailed structural information on the full-length protein. Again, WG-CFPS represents an attractive alternative to the poor expression of NSB4 in bacteria. Indeed, allowing for the addition of various additives, including detergents, this system enabled the production of full-length, well-folded and soluble NS4B in milligram amounts, compatible with structural studies [153, 154] . The detergent-solubilized NS4B protein was affinity-purified, and then reinserted into lipids to mimic the native membranous environment [59, 67, 155] . A technical issue in such a reconstitution experiment is finding the optimal lipid-to-protein ratio (LPR) for NMR samples, because the LPR needs to be high enough to ensure a well-folded protein, but as low as possible to maximize protein amounts in the NMR rotor [44] . Adapting recent fast reconstitution schemes [156] has allowed to screen different lipid compositions directly by NMR to optimize resolution [67] . This enabled the recording of 2D and 3D 1 H-detected NMR spectra, both on fully and selectively labeled NS4B and to initiate sequential assignments [67] (Figure 8 ). Two protein segments could be assigned, one validated the structural model, while the other did not confirm the predicted helix. For further work, higher magnetic fields will be an essential ingredient to push the structural understanding of this complex protein.\n",

Together, they are bringing many viral proteins and their assemblies into the focus of NMR investigations. Particularly novel and promising is the emerging opportunity to now include viruses that do not form ordered symmetrical capsids, but rather less regular nucleoprotein structures, like for example the ribonucleoprotein complexes from the dengue virus or the hepatitis D virus. Another interesting new option is the combination of solid-state NMR with cryo-EM in a hybrid structural approach, as established, for example, for amyloid fibrils [157, 158] . These developments open exciting new research avenues in the future.\n",

            "Body Text: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ribonucleic acid) virus, has been the cause for the coronavirus disease pandemic due to its extremely contagious nature. At present, no specific medicine or vaccine has been developed that could fight against all the variants of this virus in humans. Fortunately, infected people can be detected through advanced medical diagnostics.\n",
            " Nowadays, this diagnosis is conducted through the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Typically, a sample of mucus is collected from the suspected person's nose or throat. In RT-PCR technology, the genetic material of the virus is investigated. The viral genetic material is amplified through this technique, and if the person is infected actively, it can be detected. To date, this is the most reliable test, but it is unable to identify a person who has been infected recently. This is because the virus takes a few days to replicate in the nose or throat. Often, the swabs might fail to pick up indications of active infection (Harris, 2020) . Notably, this analysis takes a long time to get results. A rapid RT-PCR test, which takes less than 15 min, does exist (Harris, 2020) . However, it was found that this test has a false negative rate of 14.8% (Stein, 2020) . \"Moreover, virus isolation, serological methods and PCR-based assays often require highly trained lab workers and time-intensive procedures, as well as a highly sterile experimental environment\" (Bai et al., 2012) . Apart from the RT-PCR test, there are several other types of tests available, as listed in Table I . However, they all have limitations as indicated.\n",
            " Considering the limitations of the available SARS-CoV detection technologies, \"a possible approach is to detect specific SARS-CoV antigens such as the spike protein\" (Huang et al., 2009) . It \n",
            " Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\n",
            " Statistically, about 50% of SARS patients cannot be recognized at a primary phase depending on the viral RNA recognition; (Li et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2009; Bai et al., 2012; and Manopo et al., 2005) Time consuming process; Equipment is very expensive Real-time loop-mediated amplification assay Lower sensitivity than RT-PCR Huang et al.

            " There is a chance of infection while treating the patient with a live virus Manopo et al. (2005) was found that \"The Spike protein may mediate membrane fusion and induce neutralization antibodies in the host, raising the possibility that antibodies against the SARS-CoV Spike protein may be a good marker for early detection and neutralization of SARS-CoV infections\" (Manopo et al., 2005) . Therefore, detection of the SARS-CoV spike protein could be a rapid, accurate, and highly sensitive diagnostic method. In addition, it eliminates the risk of contamination. The objective of this study is to propose a theoretical design of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor that could detect SARS-CoV-2 through an easy and fast procedure. Numerous studies in the literature found the SPR-based biosensor to be an effective, label free, and fast detector for different pathogens, including viruses. Earlier, it was reported that an SPR-based biosensor was able to detect feline calicivirus in 15 min (Bai et al., 2012) . A similar finding was also obtained for human enterovirus 71 (EV71) (Prabowo et al., 2017) . It was found that using an SPR-based biosensor, EV71 could be detected within several minutes.\n",
            " This type of sensor was thus chosen for this design due to its remarkably high sensitivity, detection accuracy, biocompatibility, and, most importantly, speedy detection. Due to these characteristics, it is becoming a crucial sensing technology in the field of biology (Ahmed and Shaban, 2020) , chemistry , and engineering (Khan and Rahman, 2016; Khan, 2012) . The SPR-based sensor is being used in many different applications (Abdulhalim et al., 2008; Bijalwan and Rastogi, 2018; and Nazem et al., 2020) . As the focus of this proposed sensor is virus detection, previous literature that considered SPR-based biosensors for virus detection would be highlighted in brief. The sensing theory of these sensors is widely available in the literature, for example, see Homola (2006) .\n",
            " Many recent studies have considered the SPR-based sensor for medical diagnostic applications. For example, Bai et al. (2012) employed DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) aptamers as a specific identifying component in a transportable SPR-based sensor to detect avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1. The DNA aptamers showed strong binding affinity and high specificity to target AIV H5N1 (Wang et al., 2013) . Thus, Bai et al. (2012) used this aptamer as they found that it \"show(s) comparable affinity for target viruses and better thermal stability than monoclonal antibodies.\" However, this detection took about 1.5 h. In contrast, an antibody-based SPR sensor was used to detect feline calicivirus, a surrogate of norovirus, and took only 15 min (Yakes et al., 2013) . Another study used a pair of aptamers (IF10 and IF22) and developed a sandwich-type SPR biosensor and detected H5N1 whole virus from infected feces (Nguyen et al., 2016) .\n",
            " An impetuous identification of avian influenza virus subtype H6 was proposed through optical fiber-based SPR sensors in Zhao et al. (2016) . Both the core diameter and cladding thickness of 62.5 μm of a graded-index multimode optical fiber were adopted for this sensor. The fiber was side-polished, and a thin gold film of 40 nm thickness was used for the surface plasmon, with a sensing area of 5 mm. In an earlier study, a collection mode SPR sensor was proposed, with some advantages over traditional reflectance based measurement such as a high signal to noise ratio, less dependency on metal film thickness, and detection of seasonal influenza A virus, which were demonstrated to show its applicability (Francois et al., 2011) . In another study, to diagnose different stages of ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv infections caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, an SPR-based biosensor was proposed, which was able to detect the virus from a clinical serum sample (Riedel et al., 2014) . In this sensor, predominantly, the antibodies were detected against the three antigens of the virus. A localized SPR characteristic was employed to design a gold nanorod biosensor to detect hepatitis B virus (Wang et al., 2010) . In detecting the virus, the surface of the nanorod was changed with physical adsorption of the monoclonal hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb). This sensor was able to detect the virus in buffer, blood serum, and plasma. On the other hand, Choi et al. (2014) proposed a plasma-treated parylene-N film based SPR biosensor for human hepatitis B virus. It was claimed by the authors that \"the SPR biosensor with the plasma-treated parylene-N film could achieve more than 1000-fold improved sensitivity in comparison with the conventional ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kit\" (Choi et al., 2014) . Similarly, Uzun et al. (2009) used a hepatitis B surface antibody on a gold SPR chip surface to detect HBsAb in human serum. In a similar fashion, an SPR-based biosensor biochip was also developed to detect infectious bursal disease virus .\n",
            " Recently, an optical sensor (prism-based) used the SPR method to diagnose the dengue virus (DENV) E-protein (Omar et al., 2018) . The dengue virus E-protein was detected \"by measuring the SPR signal when IgM immobilized gold/Fe-MPA-NCC-CTAB/EDC-NHS thin film is exposed to the DENV E-protein solution\" (Omar et al., 2018) . For this sensor, the concentration range was varied between 0.0001 and 10 nM.\n",
            " Apart from these, Shi et al. (2015) developed a biosensor to detect nine respiratory viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, H1N1, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1-3 (PIV1, 2, and 3), and SARS. They employed a gene chip SPR-based biosensor for this detection. In brief, \"The respiratory virus target gene was extracted from bacterial culture samples and amplified by PCR technology; PCR products were then analyzed by SPR technology\" (Shi et al., 2015) . Thus, this virus detection scheme requires a lengthy procedure. Many other previous studies proposed a multilayered (e.g., gold and metamaterials) SPR-based biosensor (Cherifi and Bouhafs, 2017) . However, this was not used for virus detection.\n",
            " Most previous studies used either optical fiber-based (Zhao et al., 2019) or single layered structures for virus detection, using the surface plasmon resonance technique. In contrast, in our proposed sensor, a multilayered structure was used for potential SARS-CoV-2 detection. A single layer structure's metal film might corrode in bio-solution and would consequently reduce the sensor's quality factor and sensitivity (Wu et al., 2019) ; thus, this multi-layer structure was chosen. In addition, recent research found that \"the use of graphene and other layered materials for passivation and functionalization broadens the range of metals which can be used for plasmonic biosensing and increases the sensitivity by 3-4 orders of magnitude, as it guarantees stability of a metal in liquid and preserves the plasmonic resonances under biofunctionalization\" (Wu et al., 2019) .\n",
            " The rest of this article is organized as follows: Sec. II shows the proposed sensor structure. Section III explains the mathematical modeling and method used for this study. Finally, the results are discussed in Sec. IV before concluding the article. \n",
            " The proposed sensor structure comprises six layers with different materials, as shown in Fig. 1 . Silver is used in this sensor for its appreciable plasmonic behavior in SPR-based sensors. In this configuration, to make a sandwich-like structure, a layer of silver (Ag) is inserted between a MoSe 2 -graphene composite layer and a TiO 2 thin sheet. The optical nonlinearity improved with higher operating frequency, and overall performance also improved with the smallest Kerr effect at low operating frequency (Maurya et al., 2015a) . Therefore, the operating light wavelength is chosen as λ = 633 nm, and all the refractive index (RI) values of each material are considered at this wavelength.\n",
            " In this formation, the most practiced constituent is a prism (BK7 glass) with an RI of 1.5151 . The subsequent section on the prism is a TiO 2 layer with an RI of 2.5837 (Maurya et al., 2015a) . Previous studies found that the inclusion of oxide layers such as TiO 2 increases the sensor's sensitivity. For instance, Singh et al. (2013) found that out of three oxide layers, namely, TiO 2 , SiO 2 , and SnO 2 , the maximum sensitivity was obtained for TiO 2 . In addition, TiO 2 is used as the adhesion layer; this makes the nanostructure mechanically stable. Therefore, they can be integrated with a more complicated device or used as plasmonic sensors for liquid or even solid analytes (Ovchinnikov and Shevchenko, 2013) . Furthermore, TiO 2 has a high light-trapping ability when used as an adherence layer on the prism of an SPR-based sensor. Because of greater light-trapping capability, more surface plasmons (SPs) are generated that eventually increase the resonance angle. This increase in the resonance angle will increase the SPR sensing (Maurya et al., 2015b) . Due to these advantages of the TiO 2 layer, this was employed in this proposed sensor. The succeeding layer is silver with a complex RI of 0.1726 + j3.421 (Verma et al., 2015a) . The next two layers are MoSe 2 and graphene with RIs of 4.7954 + j1.2405 (Beal and Hughes, 1979) and 3.0 + j1.1487 (Maharana et al., 2015) , respectively. Finally, to adhere with SARS-CoV-2 testing, the recombinant monoclonal antibody named CR3022 is coated on the graphene layer. The thickness of each layer is also mentioned in Fig. 1 .\n",
            " The enumeration of reflected light intensity has been calculated by using the matrix method as this method requires no approximation for multilayer systems (Verma et al., 2015b) . T k is the thickness along the z-axis of each layer of the nanocomposite sensor structure. n k is used to represent the RI, and ϵ k is used to indicate the permittivity of the material used in the kth layer.\n",
            " The tangential components of both the electric and magnetic fields are continuous at the first surface of the first layer to the last edge of the last layer (Maurya and Prajapati, 2016) ,\n",

(1). U N−1 and v N−1 are the corresponding electric and magnetic fields at the border of the Nth layer, respectively. The characteristic matrix of the composite assembly is represented by Mij, and this equation for p-polarized light can be written as follows :\n",

            " The reflectivity, Rp, of the combined multilayer structure is specified as shown in the following equation:\n",
            " The performance characterization of an SPR-based sensor is basically contingent on the sensitivity, signal to noise ratio (SNR), and quality factor of the sensor. In order to obtain a better performance from an SPR-based biosensor, all the parameter's higher values are preferred, except the full width at half maxima (FWHM) (Verma et al., 2015a) . The detection accuracy or the SNR and the quality factor achieve a higher value with a lower value of the FWHM (Maurya and Prajapati, 2016) . The SPR angle and reflectance attributes change with the change in the RI of the sample analyte. As a fundamental performance indicating parameter, sensitivity is defined as the ratio of SPR angle change to the RI change of the sample analyte [Eq. (8) ]. The RI change of the target analyte leads to a change in the SPR angle, and this parameter is calculated with the unit of deg/RIU (Maharana et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2011) ,\n",
            " Another crucial parameter for SPR-based biosensor is the detection accuracy (DA), which is also known as the SNR, and this can be ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv determined using Eq. (9) from the SPR curve (Homola, 2008) . In addition, detection accuracy or the SNR is a unitless parameter,\n",
            " The FWHM (Δθ 0.5 ), or spectral width, is outlined as the span of the SPR curve for 50% of maximum intensity of reflected light. The parameter that is carrying a lion's share of significance is the quality factor (QF) that depends both on Δθ 0.5 and the sensitivity, and it can be represented as (Homola, 2008 )\n",
            " Notably, the detection accuracy, sensitivity, and quality factor as well as the decreasing value of the FWHM signify an SPR-based biosensor as better (Maurya and Prajapati, 2016) . For the proposed sensor, all the simulations are conducted in MATLAB.\n",
            " A laser of 633 nm wavelength was chosen as the light source for the sensor. The initial RI of the sensing medium is 1.33 RIU, and the increment Δns in RI is considered to be 0.05 RIU. In addition, the initial thickness of the TiO 2 layer is set to 5 nm. To optimize the thickness of the silver layer, we set its initial thickness at 22 nm and took the values of performance parameters and FWHM by varying the thickness up to 58 nm at an incremental rate of 2 nm. Figure 2 (a) shows the variation in sensitivity and the quality factor, with a shift in Ag layer thickness. This curve shows an increasing trend in sensitivity and the quality factor with the increase in silver thickness.\n",
            " The variation in sensitivity and detection accuracy is plotted in Fig. 2(b) with the variation in Ag layer thickness. Although the sensitivity increases with the increase in Ag layer thickness, the detection accuracy decreases initially up to a thickness of 44 nm, and then, it starts to increase again.\n",
            " In addition, the sensitivity is potted against FWHM in Fig. 2 (c) with respect to the thickness of the silver layer. The sensitivity increases with the increase in the thickness of the silver layer. Similarly, the FWHM increases with the increase in the silver layer's thickness up to 46 nm, and then, it starts to decrease gradually. Figure 2 (c) shows that these two lines cross at about 54 nm silver layer thickness. Previous studies found that at a thickness of 55 nm, silver showed a high quality factor with a lower FWHM, compared with the gold film for SPR-based sensor applications (Mukhtar et al., 2018) . However, in this study, 58 nm is found to be the best thickness for silver with respect to the sensitivity, quality factor, and detection accuracy of the proposed sensor. Beyond this thickness, the quality factor and detection accuracy were found to be unchanged. Thus, the thickness of the silver film was chosen as 58 nm for this proposed sensor structure, along with different material layers. In addition, silver in a multi-layered structure was found to have an enhanced quality factor compared to the single layer (Tran et al., 2017) .\n",
            " The performance of the proposed sensor was compared with different layers of materials to check the sensor's overall performance. The refractive index of the sensing medium is given as na = ns + Δns, where Δns represents the variation in the RI of the target solution medium. As shown in Fig. 3 , the reflectance of five SPR sensor structures is presented with the variation in the incident angle, where the structures are (a) Ag, (b) Ag-graphene, (c) Ag-MoSe 2 , (d) Ag-MoSe 2 -graphene, and (e) TiO 2 -Ag-MoSe 2 -graphene. In this computation, the change in the RI of the sensing solution is considered as Δns = 0.005 RIU. As shown in Fig. 3(e) , the shift in the dip in reflectance spectra is the highest after the introduction of the TiO 2 layer with the Ag-MoSe 2 -graphene hybrid structure, which is 0.97 ○ . In contrast, the lowest shift (0.84 ○ ) is observed for the Ag layer only [see Fig. 3(a) ]. In this proposed sensor structure, the graphene layer was used due to its \"significant properties such as strong adsorption of molecules, signal amplification by optical, high carrier mobility, electronic bridging, ease of fabrication and therefore, have established as an important sensitivity enhancement substrate for SPR\" (Patil et al., 2019; Hassan and Khan, 2014) . Due to these characteristics, many recent studies also used the graphene layer for sensor applications (Bijalwan et al., 2020; Moznuzzaman et al., 2020; and Moznuzzaman et al., 2021) .\n",
            " The selected multilayered structure, that is, a TiO 2 layer, a thin silver film, a single sheet of MoSe 2 , and a single graphene sheet, can be implemented by the method of deposit and transfer on a prism. In terms of prism selection, sensitivity, quality factor, and detection accuracy were taken into account, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 3 (f) as a function of the RI of the prism. The highest sensitivity, quality factor, and detection accuracy were found at an RI of 1.5151, and it is a BK7 prism. Thus, the BK7 prism was chosen for this proposed sensor. Due to these characteristics of the BK7 prism, it was used in many previous studies (Cherifi and Bouhafs, 2017; Tran et al., 2017; and Prabowo et al., 2017) . Table II lists the main performance parameters such as sensitivity, quality factor, and detection accuracy of the SPR sensor with different composite structures. It was revealed that the sensor with TiO 2 -Ag-MoSe 2 -graphene multilayers achieved the highest sensitivity. It was found that the proposed sensor's sensitivity (194 ○ /RIU), quality factor (54.0390 RIU −1 ), and detection accuracy (0.2702) outperformed those of other single and multi-layered structures, except the FWHM. Therefore, a TiO 2 -Ag-MoSe 2 -graphene multilayer structure was chosen for the proposed sensor.\n",
            " There are two distinctive roles of antibodies: one is to fix exactly to their specific antigens and the other is to prompt an immune reaction against the engaged antigen by employing other cells and molecules (Sela-Culang et al., 2013) . The pair between an antibody and an antigen includes innumerable non-covalent contacts between the epitope and the paratope (Sela-Culang et al., 2013) . Proper immobilization of antibodies as biorecognition elements on the sensor surface is a significant task in order to achieve better performance of the biosensor (Sahoo et al., 2016) . This immobilization of antibodies on the sensor surface is mostly accomplished by either the physical adsorption method (Wang et al., 2010; Liedberg et al., 1983) , that is, a weak electrostatic bond, or by permanent covalent bonding through revealing functional groups of easily accessible amino acid. Direct and physical immobilization has an advantage: the antibody molecules are very adjacent to the sensing surface, and this is highly conducive for achieving higher sensitivity (Sahoo et al., 2016) . For the proposed sensor, we immobilized CR3022 antibody molecules for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Yuan et al., 2020) . The CR3022 is a \"Recombinant monoclonal antibody to COVID-19 & SARS-CoV S-glycoprotein. Manufactured using AbAb's recombinant platform with variable regions (i.e., specificity) from the B-cell clone CR3022\" (Absolute Antibody, 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-glycoprotein) promotes access into cells and is the key target of the CR3022 antibody (Haynes et al., 2007) . \"This antibody binds the amino acids 318-510 in the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spike protein\" (Absolute Antibody, 2020). The immobilization of SARS-CoV-2 antigens on the CR3022 antibodies increases the RI of the sensing layer, and this increased RI leads to a right shift in the SPR angle. By investigating this angular shift using attenuated total reflection (ATR), the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in the target sample can be determined. Figure 4 (a) shows the reflectance vs incident angle curves. The resonance angle of antibody coating on the graphene layer is 77.67 ○ , whereas the resonance angle with the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution is 77.86 ○ .\n",
            " In this technique, the collected SPR angle shift makes the conditions regarding either the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or not possible. The borderline criterion is signified by\n",
            " where (Δθ Ab−Ag SPR ) min directs the borderline value for the smallest change in the SPR angle. This value is for the PBS solution on the immobilization of antibody coating. As the immobilized CR3022 antibody only attaches to the antigen of SARS-CoV-2, the change in the SPR angle greater than this marginal value determines the existence of SARS-CoV-2. In this account, Eq. (12) (Diéguez et al., 2012) reveals the increase in the RI for increases in the concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 sample solution,\n",
            " scitation.org/journal/adv \n",
            " where cv is the concentration of the virus solution, n 1 represents the RI of the immobilized CR3022 antibody, and the rate of change of RI with the change of concentration of SARS-CoV-2 solution is dn/dc = 0.181 cm 3 /gm (Diéguez et al., 2012) . As the RI of the sensing medium changes with the adsorption of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, the SPR angle shifts rightward and makes a change in the propagation constant. Thus, this proposed improved performance SPR-based sensor is employed to identify SARS-CoV-2 using the angular investigation method. A SARS-CoV-2 solution (range of concentration from 0.0001 to 100 nM) was inserted into the contact of the immobilized CR3022 film on the graphene surface. The SPR curve for SARS-CoV-2 solutions in contact with the specific graphene/CR3022 is shown in Fig. 4(b) . The result shows that the SPR angle shifts insignificantly, i.e., 77.28 ○ to 77.40 ○ , when the target SARS-CoV-2 antigen concentration was varied from 0.0001 to 0.001 nM. This was perhaps because of the less amount of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in these lower concentrated solutions to fix onto the coated CR3022 antibody.\n",
            " On the other hand, for high SARS-CoV-2 concentrations (0.01 and 10 nM), the SPR angles changed to a significant extent. The change was due to the increase in SARS-CoV-2 antigens that were being adsorbed on the antibody surface. Thus, it accordingly enlarged the change in the SPR angle. A similar type of finding was also reported in Fen et al. (2011) .\n",
            " The change in the SPR angle (θSPR) was calculated by subtracting the SPR angle of the target solution from that of the reference PBS solution (77.28 ○ ). The change in the SPR angle is mainly dependent on the bindings of the CR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 antigens. More specifically, the greater the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 antigens to the CR3022 antibody surface, the greater the change in the SPR angle that can be observed. The shift in the SPR angle slightly increased due to the molar concentration increase in the SARS-CoV-2 antigen solution up to 0.001 nM. The variation in the SPR angle was observed in a range from 0.08 ○ to 0.21 ○ for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen concentration of 0.0001 to 0.001 nM. This outcome can be recognized by the additional immobilization between the target sample and the ligand, and this led to an increase in the RI of the detecting layer. This outcome is in line with Shankaran et al. (2005) , who found that the increase in the SPR angle is the consequence of the developing bond of the antigen-antibody reaction. However, for the concentration of 100 nM, the SPR angle shift decreased compared to that of the previous concentrations. Due to the high concentration of the antigen, the antibody coated surface was entirely shielded and became congested (Omar et al., 2018) .\n",
            " Finally, the modification of the RI due to the variation in different concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein solution was also checked and is plotted in Fig. 4(c) . This linear relationship (R 2 = 0.9544) further justifies the value of the proposed sensor for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a highly sensitive manner as a similar nature of the relation was found for an SPR aptasensor to detect AIV H5N1 (Bai et al., 2012) .\n",
            " The concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein solution was varied between 0.0000 and 10 nM, and related SPR angle shift is depicted in Table III . Analysis shows that a linear relationship exists between the concentration and SPR angle changes, which is a desired characteristic for a sensor (Omar et al., 2018) .\n",
            " Similar linear trends were also found for the SPR angle shift and cumulative shift of the resonance angle against the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein solution's concentration, as listed in Table III . This further ensures a positive characteristic of the proposed sensor (Omar et al., 2020) .\n",
            " In summary, the proposed sensor's sensitivity was found to be 13.40%, 11.34%, and 1.03% higher than the sensor structure with silver only, silver-graphene, and silver-MoSe 2 -graphene, respectively. In terms of the quality factor, the new sensor achieved about 40.9%, 43.16%, and 35.75% higher quality factor compared to the silver only, silver-graphene, and silver-MoSe 2 -graphene structures, respectively. Similarly, the detection accuracy was also found to be higher than that of the others.\n",

            "Body Text: Viruses can have a devastating effect despite their small genomes. All RNA viruses encode proteins that are essential for structural components and replication, and most encode proteins that function to circumvent host antiviral responses [1] [2] [3] . This limited number of proteins is sufficient to ensure the entry, replication and subsequent spread of the virus. However, viruses do not self-propagate and depend on various host-cell functions to complete their life cycle. The processes of viral entry, the triggering and regulation of the host antiviral response and subsequent viral replication together result in an intricate series of interactions between virus and host. Much can be learnt about the nature and complexities of these interactions by global profiling of the transcriptional changes in host cells that occur during viral infection (BOX 1) .\n",
            " In this Review, we discuss how functional genomic and systems-biology approaches are contributing to our understanding of interactions between RNA viruses and the host, of viral pathogenesis and of host immunity to infection. Rather than providing a comprehensive literature review, we present examples of how these approaches are providing insight into the interaction of viruses with innate immune defence mechanisms, the evaluation of therapeutics that target these pathways and the crucial balance between protective immune responses and immunopathology. In addition, we describe how genomic approaches are being applied to vaccine evaluation and design, and how these approaches can be combined with other high-throughput technologies to provide an improved and integrated systems-biology view of virus infection.\n",
            " Although genomic approaches are being used to study a wide variety of viruses, we highlight the current literature through discussion of a select few. Among these is influenza virus, for which the looming threat of a new pandemic and concerns regarding therapeutic and vaccine preparedness have stimulated exciting new research efforts. We also review findings relating to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, for which genomic analyses are being used to shed light on the response of patients to treatment with type I interferons (IFNs) and the relationship between HCV replication and liver disease. In addition, we highlight studies of West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Ebola virus, all of which have revealed previously undescribed strategies used by these viruses to regulate innate immunity. Finally, we discuss how genomic approaches are being applied to vaccine evaluation and how genomics is being combined with other high-throughput approaches to provide a systems-biology view of virus-host interactions.\n",
            " Viruses and innate immunity A variety of cellular signalling networks have evolved in host cells to detect and respond to viral infection. One area in which genomics-based analyses are being put to Abstract | Although often encoding fewer than a dozen genes, RNA viruses can overcome host antiviral responses and wreak havoc on the cells they infect. Some manage to evade host antiviral defences, whereas others elicit an aberrant or disproportional immune response. Both scenarios can result in the disruption of intracellular signalling pathways and significant pathology in the host. Systems-biology approaches are increasingly being used to study the processes of viral triggering and regulation of host immune responses. By providing a global and integrated view of cellular events, these approaches are beginning to unravel some of the complexities of virus-host interactions and provide new insights into how RNA viruses cause disease.\n",
            " These genes contain interferon (IFN)-responsive promoters and are responsible for the antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory properties of IFN. Over 400 such genes have been identified by microarray analysis. Some, such as protein kinase R, ribonuclease L, Mx1 (myxovirus resistance 1) and ISG15 (IFN-stimulated protein of 15 kDa), have well documented antiviral activities, but the precise biological function of the majority of these genes is unknown.\n",
            " particularly good use is in shedding new light on the components of innate antiviral defence mechanisms and the viral strategies used to overcome them. In this section, we review recent studies in which genomic approaches have been used to provide new information on how viruses trigger and regulate innate immune pathways, and to evaluate the use of type I IFN-based therapy as a means to enhance the innate immune response to HCV.\n",
            " Mammalian cells have specialized proteins that are responsible for the recognition of virus infection, and other proteins that elicit responses to combat the invading virus. The antiviral response is triggered when host pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) are engaged by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in viral proteins and nucleic acids (reviewed in ReFS 4, 5) . PRRs that function in virus recognition include the cytosolic double-stranded RNA helicases retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIg-I) and\n",
            " MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) and certain Toll-like receptors (TlRs) that are present on the cell surface or in endosomal membranes. After binding to viral PAMPs, PRRs initiate intracellular signalling cascades that result in the activation of transcription factors, including IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). These transcription factors in turn regulate the expression of hundreds of genes, such as IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISgs) 6, 7 , and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are involved in the orchestration of the adaptive immune response (FIG. 1) .\n",
            " One way in which gene-expression profiling has been used to examine this aspect of the antiviral response is through the use of mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in RIg-I or MDA5. A recent study demonstrated that West Nile virus infection of wild-type cells led to the induction of IRF3 target genes and ISgs, including several subtypes of IFNα (ReF. 8) . This was followed by a second phase of IFN-dependent antiviral gene expression that occurred at a later stage of infection. By contrast, cells lacking RIg-I had delayed or inhibited initial and secondary gene-expression responses to the virus, indicating that RIg-I has an essential but not exclusive role in initiating innate immune responses to West Nile virus (FIG. 2) . The additional deletion of MDA5 in these cells was found to further block their ability to respond to infection, indicating that the host immune response to West Nile virus also involves MDA5. This is a noteworthy finding, as previous studies suggested that RIg-I and MDA5 recognized a specific subset of viruses, rather than acting cooperatively as found in the response to West Nile virus 9 .\n",
            " The role of RIg-I in the response to influenza virus infection has also been assessed 10 . Similar to West Nile virus, genomic analysis of influenza virus-infected wild-type and RIg-I-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed that RIg-I is necessary for the type I IFN response to this virus (FIG. 2) . In RIg-I-deficient cells, influenza virus fails to elicit the expression of IFNβ and of many ISgs, including key antiviral mediators such as IRF3, STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), IFIT1 (IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1; also known as ISg56) and ISg54 (also known as IFIT2). This study also showed that, unlike during infection with West Nile virus, MDA5 does not function as a secondary mediator of the response to infection with influenza virus 10 . Important next steps in these studies will be to compare the profiles of genes induced by each of these viruses -and to determine whether some genes are specific for RIg-I or MDA5 signalling -and to begin to define the involvement of these genes in innate immunity. Although this biological validation process will be necessary to follow-up genomic analyses, few studies so far have included such experiments.\n",
            " Functional genomic analyses have also been helpful in elucidating the complex transcriptional events triggered following TlR signalling. TlRs are expressed by various immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphocytes, and a subset of these receptors are involved in viral recognition. So far, genomic studies have largely focused on the analysis of macrophages treated with TlR ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide (lPS; a component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (a synthetic mimic of viral double-stranded RNA, dsRNA) [11] [12] [13] .\n",
            " To obtain a comprehensive view of the transcriptional programmes that are induced by TlR activation, Elkon et al. used a computational approach to analyse geneexpression data sets derived from four studies in which human or mouse macrophages were stimulated with pathogen-mimetic agents that engage various TlRs 14 . This analysis identified one transcriptional profile that is universally activated by all TlRs and a second profile that is specific to both TlR3 (which specializes in the recognition of viral dsRNA) and TlR4 (which recognizes\n",
            " Genomics is broadly defined as the study of genomes. The term was first adopted nearly 20 years ago to describe the emerging discipline of using nucleotide sequencing, gene mapping and computational biology to define the structure and organization of a genome 110 . As ever increasing amounts of nucleotide sequence information have become available, the focus of genomics has expanded to include gene function 93 . The Human Genome Project was a driving force in advancing both structural and functional genomics, and the nucleotide sequence information generated by this project has fuelled tremendous advances in our understanding of human health and disease. One way in which this has occurred is through the convergence of comprehensive genome sequence information with advances in high-throughput technology.\n",
            " Today, the standard technology in functional genomics is the oligonucleotide microarray [111] [112] [113] . Several alternative platforms are available, with the most common being microarrays for which thousands of oligonucleotide 'probes', each corresponding to an mRNA transcript, are synthesized in situ directly on a glass slide. Such microarrays enable researchers to simultaneously measure the expression of virtually all genes in a genome. For 'target' preparation, mRNA is extracted from experimental samples and labelled with fluorescent dyes by reverse transcription. The labelled target is then hybridized with the microarray, and the fluorescence of the features is determined using an array scanner. Following image analysis, the data are subjected to a variety of bioinformatic processes to identify statistically significant changes in gene expression between samples. Because each comparison yields tens of thousands of data points, mining the data for biological meaning is a formidable challenge. A variety of sophisticated commercial and open-source analysis tools are therefore used to find relationships between differentially expressed genes, to identify networks or signalling pathways that are activated or repressed and to compare gene-expression profiles between experimental samples. envelope components of viruses and cell-surface components of bacteria (such as lPS)). A computational analysis of promoter sequences identified NF-κB as the key regulator of the universal response, which occurs early after TlR stimulation, and the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) as the key component of the TlR3 and TlR4 response, which is induced after the NF-κB response. This computational approach provided additional knowledge regarding the kinetics of the TlR3 and TlR4 response, the regulatory circuitry involved and the identity of the genes Figure 1 | Stimulation of interferon-stimulated gene expression and initiation of antiviral activity. Pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in viral proteins and nucleic acids are recognized by cellular pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) that include RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible gene I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) and certain Toll-like receptors (TLRs). PRR-PAMP interactions trigger signalling cascades that result in the activation of transcription factors, including interferon (IFN)-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which induce the production of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The specific process differs between antigen-presenting cells, in which both the TLR pathway and the RIG-I or MDA5 pathway are operative, and other cell types, in which only the RIG-I or MDA5 pathway is present. Activation of PRR signalling induces an antiviral state in all cell types, and in antigen-presenting cells it can also induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This normally results in an innate antiviral response that controls infection until it is resolved by the adaptive immune response. However, some viruses, such as the 1918 pandemic influenza virus, elicit an aberrant or disproportional response that results in immunopathology. Alternatively, viruses that suppress the type I IFN response can subvert the mechanisms of innate surveillance and diminish the potential adaptive immune response, resulting in a chronic infection. For vaccine strategies, the best induction of a broad adaptive immune response might require some degree of type I IFN response in the initial stages of infection.

These mice can be transplanted with human hepatocytes to generate chimeric mousehuman livers, providing the only small-animal infection model for hepatitis C virus infection. activated in both the universal and TlR3-and TlR4mediated responses. Although these studies have provided considerable information regarding the genes activated downstream of TlR activation, it will be advantageous to extend genomic analyses in the context of viral infection using cells lacking the expression of specific TlRs.\n",
            " The ability of a virus to establish an infection depends, at least to some extent, on its ability to block the host innate immune response or to modulate the activity of antiviral effector proteins. HCV is one example of a virus that has devised a means to block the initial triggering of the host innate immune response. Several studies have shown that the HCV NS3-NS4A serine protease blocks the TlR3-dependent activation of IRF3 (ReFS 17, 19) . This is achieved by NS3-NS4A-mediated cleavage of TRIF (Toll/interleukin-1 (Il-1) receptor-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFNβ), an adaptor protein that links TlR3 to kinases that are responsible for activating IRF3 and NF-κB 17, 19 . HCV also inhibits the ability of RIg-I to activate IRF3 (ReFS 15,16,18,20), which is achieved through NS3-NS4A-mediated cleavage of IPS1 (IFNB-promoter stimulator 1; also known as VISA, CARDIF, MAVS), a recently identified RIg-I adaptor protein [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .\n",
            " In light of these findings, it is both perplexing and paradoxical that virtually all gene-expression profiling carried out using HCV-infected tissue shows the induction of ISg expression, including IRF3 target genes [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . The induction of ISg expression is observed in liver tissue from HCV-infected patients 30, 32, 37 and during the initial host response in acutely infected chimpanzees 26, 28 , and is a major part of the transcriptional response to HCV infection in the chimeric SCID-Alb/uPA mouse model 33 . This poses an interesting question about the source of both type I IFNs and ISg expression. It is possible that ISgs are mainly expressed in uninfected hepatocytes and are induced in response to exogenous type I IFN released from adjacent HCV-infected cells. Alternatively, it has been suggested that T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells that infiltrate the liver are a possible source of hepatic type I IFNs 37 . Although this is possible, it is relevant to note that HCV infection in the SCID-Alb/uPA mouse model is also associated with the induction of hepatic ISg expression in the absence of these immune cell types 33 .\n",
            " Other genomic studies have revealed examples of highly virulent viruses that are relatively successful at inhibiting ISg expression. Perhaps the best example is a characterization of the host transcriptional response of human liver cells infected with filoviruses 38 . This study demonstrated the marked suppression of genes in key innate antiviral pathways, including those mediated by IRF3. Interestingly, this study also suggested a correlation between the antagonism of the type I IFN response and filovirus virulence. Highly virulent viruses, such as Zaire Ebola virus and Marburgvirus, inhibit the expression of most ISgs that are induced in uninfected IFN-treated cells. By contrast, the relatively non-pathogenic Reston Ebola virus is less inhibitory and induces the expression of more than 20% of these genes. The suppression of the type I IFN response by the pathogenic viruses is associated with more rapid viral spread and higher rate of viral replication than that observed during Reston Ebola virus infection.\n",
            " A comparable trend was seen in a study evaluating the host transcriptional response and inflammation in the brains of mice infected with rabies virus 39 . This study revealed that infection with an attenuated virus results in both inflammation and the induction of expression of key ISgs. However, these events are either absent or diminished during infection with a highly pathogenic rabies virus. On the basis of results with filoviruses, it would follow that attenuation of the type I IFN response would be associated with higher viral replication and spread in the case of pathogenic infection with rabies virus; however, this was not measured in the study. Similarly, infection with highly virulent pseudorabies virus suppressed the induction of a subset of ISgs, even in type I IFN-treated cells 40 . Together, these data suggest that the virulence of acute, highly pathogenic viruses is at least partially related to their ability to suppress the host antiviral response, which seems to allow higher levels of viral replication.\n",
            " Genomic analyses using cells that lack RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible gene I) show the requirement for this pathogen-recognition receptor in the induction of interferonregulatory factor 3 (IRF3) target genes and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) by West Nile virus and influenza virus. a | The infection of RIG-I-deficient cells by West Nile virus results in the delay and partial inhibition of ISG expression. Deletion of MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) further blocks the response to infection (not shown), indicating that the response to West Nile virus also involves MDA5. b | By contrast, the infection of RIG-I-deficient cells by influenza virus results in a near complete inhibition of ISG expression that is not further blocked by the absence of MDA5, suggesting that MDA5 does not mediate influenza virus-induced gene-expression changes. PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Images generated from data in ReFS 8, 10. Suppression of innate immunity and persistent infection. Evidence discussed in this Review suggests that suppression of elements of the innate immune response enables extensive viral replication and increased pathogenesis. Does the converse hold true for a virus such as HCV, which typically establishes a persistent infection characterized by mild (or slowly progressing) disease? Some evidence suggests that this might be the case; for example, studies using the chimeric SCID-Alb/uPA mouse model indicate that an attenuated type I IFN response is associated with higher levels of intrahepatic HCV replication together with a greater induction of lipid metabolism and oxidative-stress genes, which have the potential to cause cytopathic effects 33 .\n",
            " Similarly, gene-expression profiling of serial liver biopsies obtained from patients that had received an HCV-infected liver transplant shows that rapid progression of fibrosis following transplantation is associated with the suppression of genes involved in the type I IFN response, antigen presentation and the cytotoxic T-cell response 30 . Although in these studies the apparent defect in the host antiviral response is probably related to host genetics rather than viral factors, the concept that a defective innate immune response correlates with enhanced pathogenesis is still evident. It is possible that the selective pressures on persistent viruses never resulted in a need for a complete subversion of host innate antiviral responses, so such viruses use these responses to limit their replication to a level that does not significantly affect the normal functions of the host cell. Conversely, acute viruses, such as filoviruses, highly pathogenic influenza virus and rabies virus, seem to have evolved to antagonize these responses following cell entry to allow immediate, high levels of replication, which subsequently facilitate virus spread and transmission.\n",
            " given the importance of the innate immune response in regulating virus infection, there is considerable interest in enhancing or modulating this response for therapeutic benefit. One role for genomics in this area is assisting in the evaluation of type I IFN treatment of HCV infection. Combination therapy with IFNα and the antiviral drug ribavirin results in virus clearance in only ~50% of individuals infected with HCV genotype 1 and ~80% of individuals infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 (ReFS 41-44). As IFNα is the only approved treatment for chronic HCV, there is strong interest in improving this therapy, in understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie treatment failure and in identifying markers to accurately predict a patient's response to treatment (that is, responders or non-responders).\n",
            " Several groups that have used transcriptional profiling of patient hepatic tissue to address these issues have found that higher levels of expression of ISgs before treatment are associated with treatment failure. For example, Chen et al. carried out microarray experiments on pretreatment liver tissue obtained from a cohort of 31 patients with chronic HCV infection who subsequently underwent IFNα and ribavirin therapy 45 . This analysis identified a set of 18 genes, many of which are known ISgs; in general these genes were more highly induced in the livers of patients that did not respond to therapy. Although the authors suggest that this set of genes could therefore be used to predict the response to therapy, it remains to be determined whether they can be used to accurately predict the response in other patient cohorts. Similarly, Feld et al. showed that non-responders have significantly higher intrahepatic pretreatment expression levels of ISgs than patients who respond to type I IFN therapy 46 . Although these studies are intriguing, it is still unclear whether there is a causal relationship between higher pretreatment levels of ISgs and therapy failure. Other factors, such as viral quasispecies diversity, may also be important.\n",
            " Owing to the technical and ethical issues of obtaining sufficient liver material for gene-expression studies, investigators have also used peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to evaluate the response to treatment 47,48 . An example is ViraHepC, a multicentre study designed to define the differences in response rates among Caucasian and African Americans and to identify host and viral parameters associated with a lack of response to treatment 48 . Overall, this study showed that, during the first 28 days of treatment, a lower level of induction of known ISgs is associated with non-responsiveness to type I IFN treatment. However, in many cases, these differences are not strikingly dissimilar between responders and non-responders. The implication of such minor differences with respect to antiviral function is uncertain and the feasibility of using them for predicting a patient's response is questionable. In addition, analyses using PBMCs should be interpreted with caution, as a recent study showed that the transcriptional response to type I IFN treatment is significantly different in the blood and the liver of HCV-infected chimpanzees, presumably owing to the absence of HCV replication in PBMCs 49 . Although it has not yet been evaluated, this will almost certainly hold true for humans as well.\n",
            " An alternative mechanism of a failed response to type I IFN treatment could involve the induction of genes associated with IFN inhibitory pathways 46 . Walsh et al. found significantly increased intrahepatic expression of the gene encoding suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) in patients who did not respond to type I IFN treatment 50 . Enhanced intrahepatic SOCS3 expression is also thought to contribute to the non-responsiveness of HCV-infected chimpanzees to type I IFN therapy 51 . However, a separate evaluation of 21 patients for intrahepatic SOCS3 mRNA expression before antiviral therapy actually found higher levels of expression in those patients who went on to respond successfully to type I IFN treatment 51 . Therefore, the relationship between treatment failure and induction of type I IFN inhibitory pathways is currently less clear than that between higher pretreatment levels of expression of ISgs and treatment failure.\n",
            " There are still surprisingly few answers to the fundamental question of how virus infection results in disease pathology. Although the mechanisms are certain to be different for each virus, a common theme is that there is \n",
            " Abarrently high and sustained Nature Reviews | Immunology Infection resolves Immunopathology a crucial balance between protective immune responses and immunopathology 52,53 . Although the innate immune response is designed to target and eliminate invading pathogens, genomic analyses have indicated that some viruses, such as the highly virulent influenza virus that was responsible for the 1918 pandemic, elicit aberrant or disproportional innate immune responses that may also harm the host. The 1918 influenza virus pandemic (known as the Spanish Flu) killed as many as 50 million people worldwide 54 , and several studies have begun to provide clues to what made this virus so deadly (reviewed in . Although genomic analyses have previously been carried out using engineered viruses containing one or more genes from the 1918 pandemic virus 58,59 , a major advance in the ability to study this virus came from its reconstruction based on nucleotide sequence information 60 . genomic analyses of lung or bronchial tissue derived from mice or macaques that were infected with the reconstructed 1918 virus indicate how the beneficial role of the innate immune response can be tipped towards immunopathology.\n",

This includes a marked activation of genes associated with pro-inflammatory and cell-death pathways by 24 hours after infection (FIG. 3) , which remain unabated until the death of the animals. This response is in contrast to the less dramatic and delayed host immune responses (and less severe disease pathology) in mice that were infected with influenza viruses containing only subsets of genes from the 1918 virus, including the haemagglutinin (HA) and non-structural protein (NS) genes, or the HA, neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes. These findings suggest that enhanced pro-inflammatory and cell-death responses can contribute to severe immunopathology.\n",
            " An additional study that evaluated the host response to the 1918 influenza virus using a cynomologus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) infection model produced similar results 62 . In macaques, the 1918 virus replicates to high levels and spreads rapidly throughout the respiratory tract of infected animals, causing severe lung damage and the massive infiltration of immune cells throughout the course of infection. Functional genomic analyses of bronchial tissue revealed that the 1918 virus triggers the aberrantly high and sustained expression of numerous genes involved in the innate immune response, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Although the timing of the response is somewhat different, the increased and sustained host response in macaques that were infected with the 1918 virus is similar to that observed in mice.\n",
            " These studies reveal similarities and differences in the host response to contemporary and 1918 pandemic influenza virus infection. First, contemporary and 1918 viruses each trigger an innate immune response that includes the expression of NF-κB and IRF3 target genes, which is expected to occur if the virus triggers the RIg-I pathway in infected respiratory cells. Second, both viruses trigger a robust cytokine response that probably attracts immune-cell infiltration to infected tissues. unlike contemporary virus strains, in which the early response to infection is resolved, the innate immune response triggered by the 1918 virus is characterized by a strong and sustained induction that is associated with massive tissue damage and death of the infected animal. However, in preliminary genomic analyses carried out with lung tissue from macaques that were infected with avian H5N1 viruses, we have found that there are significant differences in the regulation of antiviral responses by the 1918 pandemic and H5N1 viruses (J. C. Kash and M.g.K., unpublished observations). Therefore, there may be differences in the ways in which highly pathogenic influenza viruses regulate the innate immune response and cause disease. The enhanced pathogenicity of the 1918 and H5N1 influenza viruses might be attributed to distinct components of their genomes. Although much emphasis has been placed on the NS1 protein of the 1918 virus acting as an inhibitor of the type I IFN response, recent evidence suggests that the viral proteins PB1 (a polymerase), HA and NA contribute to its pathogenicity 63 . likewise, the polymerases of H5N1 viruses have been linked to increased viral pathogenesis 64 , suggesting that the increased pathogenesis of these viruses may be related to their replicative fitness.\n",
            " Another respiratory virus, SARS-CoV, has emerged recently and has caused great concern among the public health and research communities. It has been suggested that disease pathology associated with SARS-CoV is caused by a disproportional immune response, illustrated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [65] [66] [67] . Studies carried out in our laboratory have combined the use of functional genomics with a cynomologus macaque infection model to study the host response to this virus 68 . We observed that SARS-CoV-infected macaques show a strong increase in the expression of innate immune response genes early after infection and that this response wanes after 4 days. Conversely, genes that are induced later in infection tend to be involved in the cell cycle and in cell repair. None of the animals used in this study succumbed to infection, and SARS-CoV-induced pathology in these macaques resembled the pathological changes seen in the majority of human patients with SARS who recover from the disease 68 . unlike the findings of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus study, these data suggest that early immune responses to SARS-CoV infection are productive and enable the host to properly fight the virus, allowing a return to cellular homeostasis. However, in the 10% of human infections in which SARS-CoV infection is fatal (mostly in the elderly), it is possible that the timing or magnitude of the response results in immunopathology. Studies using aged macaques might help to address this possibility.\n",
            " Viruses such as SARS-CoV, H5N1 influenza virus and 1918 influenza virus are all zoonotic infections, in which a virus that was adapted to another host was transferred to humans. Because the type I IFN response is somewhat different in different hosts, it is possible that these viruses, which have adapted to their normal animal hosts, elicit an aberrant response when infecting a human host in which adaptation has not occurred, resulting in immunopathology. This possibility also raises the question of how appropriate the various animal infection models (such as mice and macaques) are for the understanding of human pathogenesis. As reviewed elsewhere 56 , there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with different animal models, and it is important to keep in mind that responses observed using an animal model may not always accurately reflect the response in humans.\n",
            " Genomics in vaccine evaluation and design genomic information and high-throughput technologies are beginning to have an impact on the field of vaccine development, but the main focus has been directed towards identifying important conserved features of pathogens that could serve as immunogens and characterizing host genotypes associated with strong protective responses [69] [70] [71] \n",
            " . In recent years, it has become evident that the type I IFN response has a significant role in the development of the adaptive immune response. This commences with the influence of type I IFNs on the activation, maturation and migration of dendritic cells 72, 73 . The development of the antibody response is also enhanced by type I IFNs through the direct effect of IFN on B cells and on the priming or function of CD4 + T helper cells 74 . There is now also evidence that type I IFNs act directly on CD8 + T cells to promote clonal expansion and indirectly by stimulating cross-priming by antigen-presenting cells that have engulfed infected cells to acquire antigen [75] [76] [77] . So, viruses that suppress the type I IFN response not only subvert the mechanisms of innate surveillance, but also diminish the potential adaptive immune response that could mediate viral clearance or establish a quiescent, non-pathogenic state. For vaccine strategies, the implication is then that the best induction of a broad adaptive immune response will require some degree of type I IFN response in the initial stages.\n",
            " Just as DNA microarray technology spurred the development of functional genomics, the development of immunomic microarray technology is driving the emerging field of functional immunomics (reviewed in ReF. 114) . The goal of immunomics is to provide a detailed understanding of host immunological responses to foreign antigens through the use of high-throughput technologies and computational methods. The technologies that are central to this effort include antibody microarrays (consisting of antibodies as probes and antigens as targets), peptide microarrays (consisting of antigen peptides as probes and serum antibodies as targets) and more recently peptide-MHC microarrays (consisting of recombinant peptide-MHC complexes and co-stimulatory molecules as probes and populations of T cells as targets).\n",
            " Antibody microarrays are used to measure the concentration of specific antigens (such as cancer antigens), whereas peptide-MHC microarrays can map MHC-restricted T-cell epitopes which are involved in helper and regulatory functions of the immune system. Peptide microarrays are used in various applications, including B-cell epitope mapping and detection and diagnostic assays. Peptide microarrays are also being used in vaccine studies for mapping epitopes associated with effective immune responses and for testing the ability of experimental vaccines to generate specific antibody responses against those epitopes after immunization and challenge 115 . Studies of immune responses that are associated with different clinical outcomes, such as those of patients who are HIV positive and who rapidly progress to AIDS and those of infected long-term survivors, can also provide direction for the development of vaccines 116 . It is probable that immunomics will become an increasingly integral part of a systems-biology approach to vaccine development and of obtaining a better understanding of host immunity to virus infection.\n",
            " Animal models. We have used functional genomics to evaluate a live influenza virus vaccine in a macaque model, in which attenuation of the virus was accomplished by truncation of the gene encoding NS178. This modification eliminates or reduces the ability of the NS1 protein to antagonize type I IFN production 79 and, in mouse and swine models, such attenuated live viruses are immunogenic and protective 80, 81 . gene-expression profiling of tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells from macaques immunized with the NS1-truncated virus show clear evidence of a robust type I IFN response. Compared with immunization with a traditional killedvirus vaccine, the attenuated live-virus-vaccine group had higher antibody titres before and after challenge and a broader range of influenza virus-specific T-cell responses. Following challenge with infective virus, the protection afforded by the attenuated live-virus vaccine was evident by the limited viral replication and minor pathology observed in treated animals. In addition, gene-expression profiles of lung tissue from animals that received the attenuated live-virus vaccine show less upregulation of innate and pro-inflammatory response genes compared with animals immunized with the killed-virus vaccine or untreated animals. At the same time, the transcriptional profiles for the attenuated live-virus-vaccine animals showed a stronger induction of genes that are associated with B-cell and T-cell responses.\n",
            " The general picture overall is that the truncated-NS1containing influenza virus vaccine undergoes minimal replication but induces sufficient type I IFNs to galvanize the adaptive immune response, leaving the host in a state of adaptive preparedness after just one immunization. The early induction of type I IFNs in response to the truncated-NS1-containing vaccine might be especially important in the local B-cell response that is crucial for viral clearance. A relevant observation in this regard is that early stimulation of the respiratory-tract B cells (within 48 hours of influenza virus infection) was shown to be strongly driven by virus-induced type I IFNs 82, 83 .\n",
            " Human studies. At present, there are only limited examples in which gene-expression profiling applied to vaccine design supports a picture consistent with that described above for the influenza virus model. The standards for prevention of measles and yellow fever are immunizations with attenuated live-virus vaccines. To assess the impact of infection on primary target cells, gene-expression profiling was carried out in tissue-culture systems comparing wild-type and vaccine strains. For both measles and yellow fever, it was clear that the attenuated vaccine strains led to a greater induction of the type I IFN response than the pathogenic wild-type virus 84, 85 . Although in the case of measles virus this disparity in the IFN response has previously been shown by serological techniques 86 , expression analysis indicated that the antagonism of the response by the wild-type virus originated at the level of transcription. This early induction of the type I IFN response was also evident in microarray studies examining chimeras of the yellow fever vaccine strain that were devised as attenuated live-virus vaccines against other flaviviruses such as Dengue virus 87 . This contrasted with the low-level induction of type I IFNs by Dengue virus infection as seen by expression profiling using infection of primary cells or macaque disease models 87, 88 .\n",
            " It is interesting to note that the measles and yellow fever vaccine strains are attenuated by passage in cells from other species. Therefore, with suitable molecular understanding, the ability of some viruses to induce type I IFNs might be optimized by directed molecular techniques, as was done for the truncated-NS1 influenza virus strain. As an alternative, one might consider using recombinant type I IFNs as vaccine adjuvants instead of inducing them with the vaccine constituents 89 , but at our present level of understanding, these approaches have yet to prove clinically tenable 90 .\n",
            " Functional genomics for the evaluation of immunological memory. Functional genomic studies have been more equivocal in assessing the significance of type I IFN production during the immunological memory response. In the aforementioned macaque influenza virus study, animals receiving the attenuated live-virus vaccine showed upregulation of type I IFN pathways in tracheobronchial cells 2 days after challenge, and this coincided with the development of a strong memory response 78 . This type I IFN induction seems to be weaker than that observed at the corresponding time after the primary exposure to the vaccine, but is far lower than the type I IFN induction observed after challenge of animals receiving the killed-virus vaccine or of naive animals. This would suggest some role of this innate pathway in stimulating immunological recall.\n",
            " In contrast to this, examination of transcriptional profiles observed shortly after rechallenge of human PBMCs from individuals previously immunized against influenza virus are more in accord with early production of IFNγ, possibly arising from antigenic stimulation of memory cells 91 . Dhiman et al. also did not see evidence of a type I IFN response in a microarray study of whole blood taken from individuals immunized with measles virus after rechallenge with an attenuated live-virus vaccine strain, although genes associated with lymphocyte activation and survival were upregulated 92 . It could be considered that technical issues might hamper the relevance of these studies in assessing the role of type I IFNs in the memory response. In the case of the first study 91 , PBMCs are not a primary target of influenza virus, so virus internalization might have been inefficient and a type I IFN response might have been poor. In the measles study 92 , the earliest time point examined was 7 days after rechallenge rather than early, when the type I IFN response would be expected to be strongest. Therefore, further functional genomic experiments, with appropriately designed models, are required to address whether an early innate immune response is a key stage in triggering immunological memory.\n",
            " Functional genomics has proven to be a highly efficient method for providing broad views of the host response in studies of virus-host interactions. As we have discussed, these techniques have revealed the activation or Nature Reviews | Immunology repression of innate immune signalling pathways, crosstalk between pathways, the timing and magnitude of the immune response and, depending on the experimental system, the degree to which the immune response varies among individuals.\n",
            " Conversely, functional genomics has been less effective in pinpointing the role of specific host genes in the antiviral response or, somewhat surprisingly, in identifying previously undiscovered genes and pathways that are important in the infection process, despite this being one of its early goals 93 . Indeed, the early assumption that functional genomics would provide quick answers to the complexities of virus-host interactions has proved naive. How then can greater benefits be gained from using functional genomics to study virus-host interactions? Rather than being used as a singular approach, the future of functional genomics in virology will be in the integration of genomic data with data derived from other high-throughput technologies (FIG. 4) .\n",
            " The obvious complementary approach to functional genomics is proteomics, which will provide much needed information regarding the correlation of gene expression with protein abundance [94] [95] [96] . Our group has begun to integrate genomic and proteomic data to better understand the host response to influenza virus infection 97 . Other possibilities for data integration are also beginning to unfold. For example, microRNAs, which regulate both transcription and translation, might have an important role in mediating virus-host interactions 98 . The discovery of microRNAs in certain large DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus, suggests that some viruses may encode microRNAs to regulate cellular functions 99 . In addition, immunomic strategies (BOX 2) will provide additional opportunities to interrogate the host immune response; screens using small interfering RNAs are currently being combined with genomic data to identify specific cellular proteins that are used by viruses during infection [100] [101] [102] . Together with virology, clinical and pathology data, this integrated set of information might provide the systems-biology view that will be needed to clearly understand the role of specific host genes and pathways involved in the development of immunity or disease after virus infection.\n",
            " Another use for genomics that will no doubt expand is expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping 103 . The combination of global gene-expression data with eQTl mapping provides greater power in elucidating complex genetic traits in addition to providing insights into specific genes or mutations that might be responsible for the trait in question. This approach is currently being used to better understand the genetic basis for various disease conditions in mice [104] [105] [106] , and it is likely that it will also be useful in increasing our understanding of virus-host interactions. For example, using recombinant inbred strains of mice derived from parental strains that react differently to infection with a given virus, it should be possible to use eQTl mapping to determine chromosomal locations for potential traitcontributing factors and highlight genes of interest for the trait.\n",
            " With this increased level of complexity, however, it will be important to work closely with the bioinformatics and computational-modelling communities, and to make best use of the sophisticated bioinformatics tools, data-mining schemes and mathematical-modelling strategies that are continually being developed 107, 108 . It might also be necessary to take a step back to simpler experimental systems (such as cell-culture models) to dissect cellular events before moving on to more complex in vivo models. The use of combined computational approaches that can account for gene-regulatory networks and cell-to-cell interactions will also facilitate the move to whole animal physiological modelling.\n",
            " Functional genomics is clearly providing advances in our understanding of virus-host interactions, and the evolution to an integrated systems-biology approach holds even greater promise for the field. In addition to providing new insights into viral pathogenesis and host immunity, this approach provides a host-oriented antiviral discovery paradigm with the potential for discovering The benefits of functional genomics will be further enhanced by integrating genomic data with data derived from other high-throughput technologies. The potential information and biological insights provided by these technologies are shown. Together, these approaches will help to provide a systems-biology view of virus-host interactions that spans the flow of biological information from DNA (genetics) to mRNA (genomics) to protein (proteomics) to protein function (immunomics). new targets for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies 109 and for improving vaccine evaluation and design. We are optimistic about continuing advancements in the technologies and computational methods used to study virus-host interactions and in improved capabilities to identify, characterize and circumvent the strategies used by viruses to outsmart their long-suffering hosts.\n",
            " Recent studies have shown that RIg-I preferentially recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) with polyu motifs, whereas MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA molecules. These differences might help to explain the differential recognition and innate immune signalling induced by different RNA viruses [117] [118] [119] .\n"

In this paper, considering the heterogeneity among communities, we construct a new community network model in which the communities show significant differences in average degree. Based on this heterogeneous community network, we propose a novel mathematical epidemic model for each community and study the epidemic dynamics in this network model. We find that the location of the initial infection node only affects the spreading velocity and barely influences the epidemic prevalence. And the epidemic threshold of entire network decreases with the increase of heterogeneity among communities. Moreover, the epidemic prevalence increases with the increase of heterogeneity around the epidemic threshold, while the converse situation holds when the infection rate is much greater than the epidemic threshold.

Song). example, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009, the H7N9 avian influenza virus in 2013, the Ebola virus in 2014 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015. The problem of epidemic spreading has gained great attention over the years and people want to predict the epidemic spread trend and take effective public health measures with limited vaccine supply. As the topology properties of networks have a profound impact on the dynamics of epidemic spreading, it is necessary to consider the effect of community structure on epidemic spreading. So far, a lot of results on epidemic dynamics in community networks have been obtained [12, 14, 16, 29, 30] .\n",

            "Abstract: Interindividual variability in susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, its transmission, disease progression, and response to antiviral therapy has been attributed to host determinants and variability in multiple genes. Although most people exposed to the virus go on to develop full-blown disease at variable intervals, a proportion of them, labeled as long-term nonprogressors or exposed uninfected, possess 'natural resistance' to infection. A better understanding of genetic and immunologic basis of such a natural resistance to infection would bear important implications in designing therapeutic vaccine designs. The genetic variants that could influence susceptibility to HIV-1 and limit AIDS vary in different populations and among individuals. Meta-analyses of large cohort studies have identified numerous 'AIDS restriction genes' that regulate HIV cell entry (particularly chemokine coreceptors and their ligands), acquired and innate immunity (major histocompatibility complex, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, and cytokines), and others [tripartite interaction motif 5 a (TRIM5a) and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G] that influence outcome of HIV infection. Studies carried out in the Indian population with regard to genetic polymorphisms in chemokine receptors have shown that (i) the protective CCR5 D32 variant is rare, (ii) CCR5HHE carrying *59402A is associated with increased likelihood of infection and development of AIDS, and (iii) the Indian population generally has low CCL3L1 copy numbers ($2.3). These data have implications in developing screening tests that could identify people at higher or lower risk of infection and rate of disease progression, predict vaccine responsiveness in clinical trials and understand the pathogenic mechanisms.\n",

            "Abstract: Background: Influenza is a severe contagious disease especially in children, elderly and immunocompromised patients. Beside vaccination, the discovery of new anti-viral agents represents an important strategy to encounter seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) strains. The bacterial extra-cellular ribonuclease binase is a well-studied RNase from Bacillus pumilus. Treatment with binase was shown to improve survival of laboratory animals infected with different RNA viruses. Although binase reduced IAV titer in vitro and in vivo, the mode of action (MOA) of binase against IAV at the molecular level has yet not been studied in depth and remains elusive.\n",
            " Methods: To analyze whether binase impairs virus replication by direct interaction with the viral particle we applied a hemagglutination inhibition assay and monitored the integrity of the viral RNA within the virus particle by RT-PCR. Furthermore, we used Western blot and confocal microscopy analysis to study whether binase can internalize into MDCK-II cells. By primer extension we examined the effect of binase on the integrity of viral RNAs within the cells and using a mini-genome system we explored the effect of binase on the viral expression.\n",
            " Results: We show that (i) binase does not to attack IAV particle-protected viral RNA, (ii) internalized binase could be detected within the cytosol of MDCK-II cells and that (iii) binase impairs IAV replication by specifically degrading viral RNA species within the infected MDCK-II cells without obvious effect on cellular mRNAs.\n",
            " Conclusion: Our data provide novel evidence suggesting that binase is a potential anti-viral agent with specific intra-cellular MOA.\n",

            "Abstract: Increasing antiviral drug resistance is a major concern for treating influenza, especially in a pandemic setting when the availability of a protective vaccine is uncertain. Resistance is often an issue with drugs directed at viral proteins and for small RNA viruses there are also a limited number of viral proteins that are amenable to inhibition by a small molecule. A new approach that is gaining support is that cellular proteins, which facilitate virus replication, may be used as alternative targets. Whereas drugs directed at viral proteins tend to be virus-specific, drugs directed at host targets have the potential to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity as many viruses may share a dependency on that host function. For influenza virus, we have very limited knowledge of which cellular factors are involved in virus replication, let alone which of these have suitable properties to serve as drug targets. Through the use of high-throughput RNA interference screens, several studies have addressed this gap in our knowledge. The resulting datasets provide new insight into host pathways that are involved in the influenza virus replication cycle and identify specific host factors in these pathways that may serve as potential targets for future antiviral drug development.\n",

Objectives: To determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of WUPyV and KIPyV-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) hospitalization in HIV-infected and -uninfected children; and probe the role of pneumococcal co-infection. Study design: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from a cohort of 39,836 children randomized to receive 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV9) or placebo when hospitalized for LRTIs, and were screened by PCR for WUPyV, KIPyV and other respiratory viruses. Results: In placebo-recipients the prevalence of WUPyV was 6.3% (18/285) in HIV-infected and 13.9% (66/476) in HIV-uninfected children (p = 0.002). In WUPyV-positive LRTIs HIV-infected children had lower oxygen saturation at admission and a higher case fatality rate (11.1% vs. 0%; p = 0.04). KIPyV was identified in 10.2% (29/285) of HIV-infected and in 7.4% (35/476) of HIV-uninfected placebo-recipients with LRTIs (p = 0.13). HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected children with KIPyV-positive LRTIs had lower oxygen saturation, higher respiratory rate and longer duration of hospitalization. Co-infections with other respiratory-viruses were detected in 65.5% of WUPyV-positive LRTIs and in 75.0% of KIPyV-positive LRTIs. Among HIV-uninfected children, there was a lower incidence of hospitalization for clinical pneumonia episodes in which KIPyV (80%; 95% CI: 41, 93) and WUPyV (49%; 95% CI: 9, 71) were identified among PCV9-recipients compared to placebo-recipients. Conclusions: Polyomaviruses were commonly identified in HIV-infected and -uninfected children hospitalized for LRTIs, frequently in association with other viruses and may contribute to the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia.\n",

The rate and intensity of diffusion depend upon network topology and initialization of network parameters. Individual nodes act as source of motivation for others in the diffusion process. The epidemic model is one of the basic diffusion models that helps in analyzing the transmission of infectious disease from one person to another through social connections. This can be further generalized for other socially connected platforms involving information exchange. In our research, we have proposed a diffusion methodology for tracking the rate with which information spread over underlying social interaction structure, with variation in time and other social parameters. In addition to forward state transitions, recoverable transition is also proposed, which allows a node currently under influence of incoming information, to revert back to previous state of perception. The proposed model also assists in predicting the fraction of population getting diffused over real and large-scale complex network for specific temporal domain.\n",

            "Abstract: Background: Many low-and middle-income countries have implemented control measures against coronavirus disease 2019 . However, it is not clear to what extent these measures explain the low numbers of recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths in Africa. One of the main aims of control measures is to reduce respiratory pathogen transmission through direct contact with others. In this study, we collect contact data from residents of informal settlements around Nairobi, Kenya, to assess if control measures have changed contact patterns, and estimate the impact of changes on the basic reproduction number (R 0 ). Methods: We conducted a social contact survey with 213 residents of five informal settlements around Nairobi in early May 2020, 4 weeks after the Kenyan government introduced enhanced physical distancing measures and a curfew between 7 pm and 5 am. Respondents were asked to report all direct physical and non-physical contacts made the previous day, alongside a questionnaire asking about the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and control measures. We examined contact patterns by demographic factors, including socioeconomic status. We described the impact of COVID-19 and control measures on income and food security. We compared contact patterns during control measures to patterns from non-pandemic periods to estimate the change in R 0 . Results: We estimate that control measures reduced physical contacts by 62% and non-physical contacts by either 63% or 67%, depending on the pre-COVID-19 comparison matrix used. Masks were worn by at least one person in 92% of contacts. Respondents in the poorest socioeconomic quintile reported 1.5 times more contacts than those in the richest. Eighty-six percent of respondents reported a total or partial loss of income due to COVID-19, and 74% reported eating less or skipping meals due to having too little money for food.\n"

            "Abstract: Background: The aerosol box and intubation tent are improvised barrier-enclosure devices developed during the novel coronavirus pandemic to protect health care workers from aerosol transmission. Objective: Using time to intubation as a crude proxy, we aimed to compare the efficiency and usability of the aerosol box and intubation tent in a simulated manikin. Methods: This was a singlecenter, randomized, crossover manikin study involving 28 participants (9 anesthetists, 16 emergency physicians, and 3 intensivists). Each participant performed rapid sequence intubations in a random sequence of three different scenarios: 1) no device use; 2) aerosol box; 3) intubation tent. We compared the time to intubation between different scenarios. Results: The median total intubation time with no device use, aerosol box, and intubation tent were 23.7 s (interquartile range [IQR] 19.4-28.4 s), 30.9 s (IQR 24.1-52.5 s), and 26.0 s (IQR 22.1-30.8 s) , respectively. Post hoc analysis showed a significantly longer intubation time using the aerosol box compared with no device use ( p < 0.001) and compared with the intubation tent ( p < 0.001). The difference between the intubation tent and no device use was not significant. The first-pass intubation success rate did not differ between the groups. Only aerosol box use had resulted in breaches of personal protective equipment. Participants considered intubation with the intubation tent more favorable than the aerosol box. Conclusions: The intubation tent seems to have a better barrier-enclosure design than the aerosol box, with a reasonable balance between efficiency and usability. Further evaluation of its efficacy in preventing aerosol dispersal and in human studies are warranted prior to recommendation of widespread adoption.\n",

            " Contradictory data are available that nsp2 of highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV activates NF-κB in cells by inducing IκBα degradation and p65 translocation to the nucleus, and thus promotes the expression of IL-6, IL-10, and COX-2. The hypervariable region of nsp2 was essential for NF-κB activation (Fang et al., 2012a) . This finding was supported by Huang et al ) that nsp2 of HP-PRRSV had no inhibitory effect on IFNβ production. The nsp2 function for the innate immune modulation needs to be clarified. nsp4: PRRSV nsp4 is a serine proteinase (SP) and inhibits IFNβ promoter activity (Beura et al., 2010). Nsp4 did not hinder NF-kB phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation but antagonize IFNβ transcription in the nucleus (Chen et al., 2014b). The inhibition depends on the SP activity in nsp4. Studies also show that nsp4 cleaves NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) at a single site (glutamate 349) and thus suppresses NF-κB activation and IFNβ production (Huang et al., 2014). However, a recent study showed that scission of NEMO by nsp4 occurred at two additional sites (glutamates 166 and 171) (Chen et al., 2019). This study further showed the NEMO fragment of residues 1-349 could activate IFN-β transcription more robustly than full-length NEMO, whereas all other NEMO cleavage products were abrogated for the IFN-β-inducing capacity. Thus, NEMO cleavage at E349 alone may not be sufficient to completely inactivate the IFN response via this signaling adaptor. These findings suggest that the multiple-site NEMO-cleavage by nsp4 is critical for disarming the innate immune response for viral survival. Additionally, nsp4 suppresses IFNβ transcription by blocking NF-κB activation (Chen et al., 2014b). PRRSV nsp4 of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f\n",

            " J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 ABSTRACT In this study, we showed that a codon optimized version of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 can migrate to the cell membrane. However, efficient production of Moloney murine leukemia (MLV) infectious viral particles was only achieved with stable expression of a shorter S version in Cterminal (S) in MLV Gag-pol expressing cells. As compared to transient transfections, this platform generated viruses with a 1,000-fold higher titer. S was 15-times more efficiently incorporated into VLPs as compared to S, and that was not due to steric interference between the cytoplasmic tail and the MLV capsid, as similar differences were also observed with extracellular vesicles. The amount of S incorporated into VLPs released from producer cells was high and estimated at 1.25 µg/ml S2 equivalent (S is comprised of S1 and S2). The resulting VLPs could potentially be used alone or as a boost of other immunization strategies for COVID-19.\n",

            "Abstract: In indoor environments with limited ventilation, recirculating portable air filtration (PAF) units may reduce COVID-19 infection risk via not only the direct aerosol route (i.e., inhalation) but also via an indirect aerosol route (i.e., contact with the surface where aerosol particles deposited). We systematically investigated the impact of PAF units in a mock classroom, as a supplement to background ventilation, on localized and wholeroom surface deposition and particle concentration. Fluorescently tagged particles with a volumetric mean diameter near 2 μm were continuously introduced into the classroom environment via a breathing simulator with a prescribed inhalation−exhalation waveform. Deposition velocities were inferred on >50 horizontal and vertical surfaces throughout the classroom, while aerosol concentrations were spatially monitored via optical particle spectrometry. Results revealed a particle decay rate consistent with expectations based upon the reported clean air delivery rates of the PAF units. Additionally, the PAF units reduced peak concentrations by a factor of around 2.5 compared to the highest concentrations observed and led to a statistically significant reduction in deposition velocities for horizontal surfaces >2.5 m from the aerosol source. Our results not only confirm that PAF units can reduce particle concentrations but also demonstrate that they may lead to reduced particle deposition throughout an indoor environment when properly positioned with respect to the location of the particle source(s) within the room (e.g., where the largest group of students sit) and the predominant air distribution profile of the room.\n",

            "Abstract: This study investigated changes in dormancy and germination over 8 months for 23 common species (annual and perennial grasses, legumes and other dicotyledons) from herbaceous communities in northern Australia. Seeds were exposed to three storage treatments: relatively constant laboratory conditions, an oven with fluctuating temperatures similar to those found on the soil surface (25/60°C), or exposed on the soil surface at Townsville. There were wide ranges of initial levels of dormancy (9-100%), rates of change of dormancy and response to the different storage conditions showing that species with several types of dormancy characteristics are able to coexist in these communities. The general trend in dormancy levels was a decline with time with the rate of decline greatest for seeds exposed on the soil surface and least for those stored in the laboratory. The species were divided into groups based on dormancy levels in seeds on the soil surface during the late dry and mid wet seasons. The dormancy characteristics of the groups were related to the ecology of the species in the groups. There was an approximately linear increase in germination rate (i.e. a decrease in the number of days to 50% of final germination) over time for all storage treatments; rates for seeds on the soil surface increased more rapidly than those of seeds in laboratory and oven samples.\n",

            "Abstract: The record-breaking meiyu in the Yangtze-Huaihe River valley (YHRV) in 2020 was characterized by an early onset, a delayed retreat, a long duration, a wide meridional rainbelt, abundant precipitation, and frequent heavy rainstorm processes. It is noted that the East Asian monsoon circulation system presented a significant quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) during the meiyu season of 2020 that was associated with the onset and retreat of meiyu, a northward shift and stagnation of the rainbelt, and the occurrence and persistence of heavy rainstorm processes. Correspondingly, during the meiyu season, the monsoon circulation subsystems, including the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), the upper-level East Asian westerly jet, and the low-level southwesterly jet, experienced periodic oscillations linked with the QBWO. Most notably, the repeated establishment of a large southerly center, with relatively stable latitude, led to moisture convergence and ascent which was observed to develop repeatedly. This was accompanied by a long-term duration of the meiyu rainfall in the YHRV and frequent occurrences of rainstorm processes. Moreover, two blocking highs were present in the middle to high latitudes over Eurasia, and a trough along the East Asian coast was also active, which allowed cold air intrusions to move southward through the northwestern and/or northeastern paths. The cold air frequently merged with the warm and moist air from the low latitudes resulting in low-level convergence over the YHRV. The persistent warming in the tropical Indian Ocean is found to be an important external contributor to an EAP/PJ-like teleconnection pattern over East Asia along with an intensified and southerly displaced WPSH, which was observed to be favorable for excessive rainfall over YHRV.\n",

            "Abstract: A seasonal suicide peak in spring is highly replicated, but its specific cause is unknown. We reviewed the literature on suicide risk factors which can be associated with seasonal variation of suicide rates, assessing published articles from 1979 to 2011. Such risk factors include environmental determinants, including physical, chemical, and biological factors. We also summarized the influence of potential demographic and clinical characteristics such as age, gender, month of birth, socioeconomic status, methods of prior suicide attempt, and comorbid psychiatric and medical diseases. Comprehensive evaluation of risk factors which could be linked to the seasonal variation in suicide is important, not only to identify the major driving force for the seasonality of suicide, but also could lead to better suicide prevention in general.\n",

            "Abstract: Background: Seasonal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemics occur annually in temperate climates and result in significant pediatric morbidity and increased health care costs. Although RSV epidemics generally occur between October and April, the size and timing vary across epidemic seasons and are difficult to predict accurately. Prediction of epidemic characteristics would support management of resources and treatment.\n",
            " Methods: The goals of this research were to examine the empirical relationships among early exponential growth rate, total epidemic size, and timing, and the utility of specific parameters in compartmental models of transmission in accounting for variation among seasonal RSV epidemic curves. RSV testing data from Primary Children's Medical Center were collected on children under two years of age (July 2001-June 2008). Simple linear regression was used explore the relationship between three epidemic characteristics (final epidemic size, days to peak, and epidemic length) and exponential growth calculated from four weeks of daily case data. A compartmental model of transmission was fit to the data and parameter estimated used to help describe the variation among seasonal RSV epidemic curves. Results: The regression results indicated that exponential growth was correlated to epidemic characteristics. The transmission modeling results indicated that start time for the epidemic and the transmission parameter co-varied with the epidemic season.\n",
            " The conclusions were that exponential growth was somewhat empirically related to seasonal epidemic characteristics and that variation in epidemic start date as well as the transmission parameter over epidemic years could explain variation in seasonal epidemic size. These relationships are useful for public health, health care providers, and infectious disease researchers.\n",

            "Abstract: The Government of India in-network with the state governments has implemented the epidemic curtailment strategies inclusive of case-isolation, quarantine and lockdown in response to ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. In this manuscript, we attempt to estimate the impact of these steps across ten selected Indian states using crowdsourced data. The trajectory of the outbreak was parameterized by the reproduction number (R 0 ), doubling time, and growth rate. These parameters were estimated at two time-periods after the enforcement of the lockdown on 24 th March 2020, i.e. 15 days into lockdown and 30 days into lockdown. The authors used a crowd sourced database which is available in the public domain. After preparing the data for analysis, R 0 was estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) method which is based on the expectation minimum algorithm where the distribution probability of secondary cases is maximized using the serial interval discretization. The doubling time and growth rate were estimated by the natural log transformation of the exponential growth equation. The overall analysis shows decreasing trends in time-varying reproduction numbers (R (t) ) and growth rate (with a few exceptions) and increasing trends in doubling time. The curtailment strategies employed by the Indian government seem to be effective in reducing the transmission parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic. The estimated R (t) are still above the threshold of 1, and the resultant absolute case numbers show an increase with time. Future curtailment and mitigation strategies thus may take into account these findings while formulating further course of action.\n",

            "Abstract: Seasonal influenza activity typically peaks in the winter months but plummeted globally during the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Unraveling lessons from influenza's unprecedented low profile is critical in informing preparedness for incoming influenza seasons. Here, we explored a country-specific inference model to estimate the effects of mask-wearing, mobility changes (international and domestic), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interference in China, England, and the United States. We found that a one-week increase in mask-wearing intervention had a percent reduction of 11.3%-35.2% in influenza activity in these areas. The one-week mobility mitigation had smaller effects for the international (1.7%-6.5%) and the domestic community (1.6% to 2.8%). In 2020-2021, the mask-wearing intervention alone could decline percent positivity by 13.3-19.8. The mobility change alone could reduce percent positivity by 5.2-14.0, of which 79.8%-98.2% were attributed to the deflected international travel. Only in 2019-2020, SARS-CoV-2 interference had statistically significant effects. There was a reduction in percent positivity of 7.6 (2.4-14.4) and 10.2 (7.2-13.6) in northern China and England, respectively. Our results have implications for understanding how influenza evolves under non-pharmaceutical interventions and other respiratory diseases and will inform health policy and the design of tailored public health measures.\n",

Adolescents were aged from 10 to 19 years old (50.16% girls). Latent profile analysis revealed five life change profiles, including three improved profiles at various degrees, one unchanged profile, and one worsened profile. The majority of adolescents had an improved or unchanged life. Multinomial logistic regression analyses found that most of the individual, familial, and societal factors predicted the group memberships. Notably, parent-adolescent conflict was a significant factor that predicted memberships of all patterns.

            "Abstract: We examine the impact of early state and local COVID-19 policies to encourage social distancing. Outcomes are daily foot traffic at establishments spanning ten key industries, across which transmission risk varies substantially. Policies include state of emergency declarations, blunt general restrictions such as stay-at-home (SAH) orders, and targeted rules such as restrictions on bars, restaurants, entertainment venues, and schools. Exploiting variation in the timing of policies in difference-in-difference models, we show that much of the decline in foot traffic early in the pandemic was due to private precautionary behavior. SAH orders explain almost none of the foot traffic decline in industries with high risk of virus transmission, but they do explain a substantial share of the decline in moderate-to low-risk industries such as outdoor sports and visits to parks. Targeted restrictions tend to impact intended industries, as well as complementary ones. We show that the impact of targeted restrictions is largest in counties with no SAH restrictions, suggesting that better targeting of public restrictions can have important efficiency gains. (C.J. Cronin). 1 Compared to some places outside the US, few US jurisdictions rigorously enforced (much less took punitive actions against those ignoring) local SAH restrictions. Thus, while SAH restrictions were imposing in that they applied to the broadest set of locations, behavioral responses to the policy should be interpreted as mostly voluntary. reconsider SAH measures. For example, on November 22, California adopted regional SAH restrictions that went into effect based on intensive care unit capacity. 2 Stay-at-home restrictions have been the center of intense political debate. Many see them as a critical regulatory intervention to reduce the spread of the virus. In early April, the American Medical Association sent a letter to all governors urging states to adopt SAH restrictions. 3 Public support for SAH restrictions has been high throughout the pandemic. A nationwide survey of 2,200 adults by Morning Consult found that 69 percent of respondents supported SAH orders in June, falling only to 68 percent by November. 4 Despite their popularity in these surveys, many also consider SAH restrictions to be the cause of recent wide-spread economic dislocation. Alexander and Karger (2020) show that SAH restrictions reduced spending at small businesses and large retail stores. Moreover, protests against SAH restrictions have occurred in a number of states, 5 with court cases filed in numerous jurisdictions challenging the constitutionality of SAH orders. 6 While SAH orders have received both praise and vitriol, academic research, mostly by economists, has questioned the impact of these orders on social distancing. A variety of scholars have examined the impact of these orders, including Alexander and Karger (provide a detailed review of this literature. A large cross-section of this literature argues that the bulk of the decline in measures of social distancing that occurred in the early months of the pandemic was not due to SAH restrictions, but rather to voluntary precautionary behavior on the part of individuals. Goolsbee and Syverson (2021) estimate the impact of SAH orders on foot traffic across industries using an identification strategy that takes advantage of states in the same commuting zone that impose SAH orders at different times. Their work concludes that \"legal shutdown orders account for only a modest share of the decline of economic activity. \" Exploiting the variation across states in the timing of SAH orders, Gupta et al. (2020b) conclude that information such as the first case in an area drove increased social distancing much more than SAH orders.\n",
            " As the literature on what drives social distancing has advanced, so has our knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. Chang et al. (2020) use cell-phone records to model mobility and subsequent case counts and argue that 80 percent of COVID-19 infections can be traced to a small number of super-spreader locations such as restaurants, bars, gyms, hotels, and houses of worship. Using case-control methods Fisher et al. (2020) confirm the impact of eating and drinking establishments as a source of high transmissions. In contrast, surveillance data suggests that daycare centers ( Gilliam et al., 2021 ) and elementary schools ( Oster, 2020 ) are not particularly important sources of transmission. Likewise, outdoor activities appear to pose much lower risk to participants than virtually all indoor activities ( Weed and Foad, 2020 ; Garcia et al. 2020 ; Bulfone et al., 2020 ) . The data on supermarkets is mixed. A study by the Public Health Service in England found that among those that tested positive, the most frequent recent activity was shopping 7 and the result has been interpreted by many to suggest supermarkets are super-spreader locations. 8 Grocery store workers appear to be at a high risk of infection. A study of 104 grocery store employees in Massachusetts found an infection rate of 20 percent ( Lan et al., 2020 ) . Despite this, a study that examined an outbreak of COVID-19 among supermarket employees found high rates of transmission from employees to family members but low rates of infection among store customers ( Zhang et al., 2020 ) .\n",
            " This research seeks to merge these two literatures by considering the efficiency of social distancing policies. The findings from recent research on establishment-specific transmission risk is mostly expected. Early in the pandemic, it was assumed that the virus was transmitted similar to other respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza), meaning tightly-packed indoor spaces where eating and drinking occurred should be more dangerous. Presumably, self-interested individuals would avoid such locations independent of policy. Less clear is the impact that blunt policy instruments, such as SAH restrictions, would have on industry-specific foot traffic. The heterogeneity in transmission risks across types of locations suggests that more targeted types of mobility restrictions might offer a more efficient way to increase social distancing. As such, we return to the question considered by many of the papers listed above and use cell phone records to estimate the impact of state and county COVID-19 policies, including SAH restrictions, on foot traffic. Unlike the existing literature, we focus on the differential effect that both targeted and non-targeted restrictions have on industries that expose patrons and employees to various levels of transmission risk. Consistent with Chang et al. (2020) , we consider foot traffic patterns in 10 industries that we categorize into three different groups: higher transmission risk venues (restaurants, bars, hotels, churches, and indoor entertainment), medium-risk venues (essential retail, non-essential retail, and business services), and lower-risk venues (outdoor sports and parks). We also use one omnibus measure of social distancing: the fraction of cell phones that are home all day. All ten industry-specific foot-traffic measures declined substantially as the pandemic aged while the latter increased considerably.\n",
            " We begin by documenting what others have found -much of the increase in social distancing is not attributable to SAH restrictions but, rather, precautionary behavior on the part of individuals. We show this in two ways. First, we use structural break models to show that the most dramatic declines in foot traffic occurred prior to the adoption of legal interventions. In particular, we find that in a seven-day period from March 8-14, industry-specific foot traffic measured at the national level dropped dramatically, well before any state or local restrictions of note were in place. For most mobility measures we analyze, the structural shift occurs in most states\n"

            "Abstract: Climate change is leading to increases in global temperatures and erratic precipitation patterns, both of which are contributing to the expansion of mosquito-borne arboviruses and the populations of the mosquitos that vector them. Herein, we review recent evidence of emergence and expansion of arboviruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitos that has been driven in part by environmental changes. We present as a case study of recent work from Có rdoba, Argentina, where dengue has been actively emerging in the past decade. We review recent empirical and modeling studies that aim to understand the impact of climate on future expansion of arboviruses, and we highlight gaps in empirical studies linking climate to arbovirus transmission at regional levels.\n",

            "Abstract: As a critical post-translational modification, ubiquitination is known to affect almost all the cellular processes including immunity, signaling pathways, cell death, cancer development, and viral infection by controlling protein stability. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) cleave ubiquitin from proteins and reverse the process of ubiquitination. Thus, DUBs play an important role in the deubiquitination process and serve as therapeutic targets for various diseases. DUBs are found in eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses and influence various biological processes. Here, we summarize recent findings on the function of DUBs in modulating viral infection, the mechanism by which viral DUBs regulate host innate immune response, and highlight those DUBs that have recently been discovered as antiviral therapeutic targets.\n",

            "Abstract: Microbiologic infections acquired from animals, known as zoonoses, pose a risk to public health. An estimated 60% of emerging human pathogens are zoonotic. Of these pathogens, >71% have wildlife origins. These pathogens can switch hosts by acquiring new genetic combinations that have altered pathogenic potential or by changes in behavior or socioeconomic, environmental, or ecologic characteristics of the hosts. We discuss causal factors that infl uence the dynamics associated with emergence or reemergence of zoonoses, particularly in the industrialized world, and highlight selected examples to provide a comprehensive view of their range and diversity.\n",

            "Abstract: Candida species are a major cause of invasive fungal infections. While Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis are the most dominant species causing lifethreatening candidiasis, C. auris recently emerged as a new species causing invasive infections with high rates of clinical treatment failures. To mimic initial phases of systemic Candida infections with dissemination via the bloodstream and to elucidate the pathogenic potential of C. auris, we used an ex vivo whole blood infection model. Similar to other clinically relevant Candida spp., C. auris is efficiently killed in human blood, but showed characteristic patterns of immune cell association, survival rates, and cytokine induction. Dual-species transcriptional profiling of C. aurisinfected blood revealed a unique C. auris gene expression program during infection, while the host response proofed similar and conserved compared to other Candida species. C. auris-specific responses included adaptation and survival strategies, such as counteracting oxidative burst of immune cells, but also expression of potential virulence factors, (drug) transporters, and cell surface-associated genes. Despite comparable pathogenicity to other Candida species in our model, C. auris-specific transcriptional adaptations as well as its increased stress resistance and long-term environmental survival, likely contribute to the high risk of contamination and distribution in a nosocomial setting. Moreover, infections of neutrophils with pre-starved C. auris cells suggest that environmental preconditioning can have modulatory effects on the early host interaction. In summary, we present novel insights into C. auris pathogenicity, revealing adaptations to human blood and environmental niches distinctive from other Candida species.\n",

            "Abstract: Climate change is expected to impact across every domain of society, including health. The majority of the world's population is susceptible to pathological, infectious disease whose life cycles are sensitive to environmental factors across different physical phases including air, water and soil. Nearly all so-called neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) fall into this category, meaning that future geographic patterns of transmission of dozens of infections are likely to be affected by climate change over the short (seasonal), medium (annual) and long (decadal) term. This review offers an introduction into the terms and processes deployed in modelling climate change and reviews the state of the art in terms of research into how climate change may affect future transmission of NTDs. The 34 infections included in this chapter are drawn from the WHO NTD list and the WHO blueprint list of priority diseases. For the majority of infections, some evidence is available of which environmental factors contribute to the population biology of parasites, vectors and zoonotic hosts. There is a general paucity of published research on the potential effects of decadal climate change, with some exceptions, mainly in vectorborne diseases.\n",

            "Abstract: Community-networks such as families and schools may foster and propagate some types of public health disasters. For such disasters, a communitarianoriented ethical lens offers useful perspectives into the underlying relational nexus that favors the spread of infection. This chapter compares two traditional bioethical lenses-the communitarian and care ethics framework-vis-à-vis their capacities to engage the moral quandaries elicited by pandemic influenza. It argues that these quandaries preclude the analytical lens of ethical prisms that are individual-oriented but warrant a people-oriented approach. Adopting this dual approach offers both a contrastive and a complementary way of rethinking the underlying socioethical tensions elicited by pandemic influenza in particular and other public health disasters generally.\n",

            "Abstract: Along the Florida coast, decreasing freeze events are promoting the range shift of the mangrove species Avicennia germinans northward into temperate salt marsh wetlands. Although plant species' ranges are tightly linked with their climatic tolerances, there is considerable variability in the magnitude by which biotic factors like competition and facilitation may also influence range shifts. Changes in mangrove and marsh plant abundance can alter both the above and belowground environment, which may in turn influence ecosystem services typically associated with these systems such as storm surge abatement and carbon storage. Therefore, it is key to understand (1) how the above and belowground environment of established salt marshes influences establishment of mangroves, and (2) how above and belowground environments shift in response to mangrove encroachment. Using a semi-natural mangrove planting experiment, we investigated the impact of four distinct marsh plant community structures (Batis maritima, Spartina alterniflora, mixture of B. maritima and S. alterniflora, mudflat) on mangrove survivorship and decomposition rate. In mixed marsh plots, mangrove survivorship was 42 % higher compared to survivorship in mudflat plots, and decomposition rate was 47 % greater in mixed marsh plots compared to mudflat. However, percent cover of vegetation differed across treatments, and was highest in mixed marsh plots. High survivorship in mixed marsh plots is likely due to increased protection from physical stressors by the dense aboveground cover, and belowground plant root-driven effects such as nutrient availability and oxygen delivery. Our findings suggest that above and below ground differences in salt marsh plant community structure can have an impact on the survival of encroaching mangroves, which may have implications for predicting future mangrove encroachment and improving mangrove restoration techniques.\n",

            "Abstract: The extent and duration of immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical outstanding questions about the epidemiology of this novel virus, and studies are needed to evaluate the effects of serostatus on reinfection. Understanding the potential sources of bias and methods to alleviate biases in these studies is important for informing their design and analysis.\n",
            " Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serologic studies in the context of an uncontrolled or a controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytic approaches to analyze the simulated data. We find that in studies assessing whether seropositivity confers protection against future infection, comparing seropositive individuals to seronegative individuals with similar time-dependent patterns of exposure to infection, by stratifying or matching on geographic location and time of enrollment, is essential to prevent bias.\n",

Concern for the environment in the United States derives from two distinct historical ideologies that we term ''green'' and ''brown'' environmentalism. We propose a modern-day synthesis of these ideologies that recognizes that environmental degradation and the emergence of zoonotic and epizootic diseases, affecting both humans and wildlife (i.e., pathogen pollution), are interconnected. This interconnection provides a compelling new reason to protect and preserve biodiversity.\n"

This novel virus can be found on various surfaces in contaminated sites such as clinical places, however, the behaviour and molecular interactions of the virus with respect to the surfaces are poorly understood. Regarding this, the virus adsorption onto solid surfaces can play a critical role in transmission and survival in various environments. In this article, firstly an overview of existing knowledge concerning viral spread, molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2, and the virus surface stability is presented. Then, we highlight potential drivers of the SARS-CoV-2 surface adsorption and stability in various environmental conditions. This theoretical analysis shows that different surface and environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, and pH are crucial considerations in building fundamental understanding of the virus transmission and thereby improving safety practices.\n",

            "Abstract: Understanding the interactions between viruses and surfaces or interfaces is important, as they provide the principles underpinning the cleaning and disinfection of contaminated surfaces. Yet, the physics of such interactions is currently poorly understood. For instance, there are longstanding experimental observations suggesting that the presence of air-water interfaces can generically inactivate and kill viruses, yet the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown. Here we use theory and simulations to show that electrostatics may provide one such mechanism, and that this is very general. Thus, we predict that the electrostatic free energy of an RNA virus should increase by several thousands of k B T as the virion breaches an air-water interface. We also show that the fate of a virus approaching a generic liquid-liquid interface depends strongly on the detailed balance between interfacial and electrostatic forces, which can be tuned, for instance, by choosing different media to contact a virus-laden respiratory droplet. Tunability arises because both the electrostatic and interfacial forces scale similarly with viral size. We propose that these results can be used to design effective strategies for surface disinfection.\n",

            "Abstract: During viral infection, virus-derived cytosolic nucleic acids are recognized by host intracellular specific sensors. The efficacy of this recognition system is crucial for triggering innate host defenses, which then stimulate more specific adaptive immune responses against the virus. Recent studies show that signal transduction pathways activated by sensing proteins are positively or negatively regulated by many modulators to maintain host immune homeostasis. However, viruses have evolved several strategies to counteract/evade host immune reactions. These systems involve viral proteins that interact with host sensor proteins and prevent them from detecting the viral genome or from initiating immune signaling. In this review, we discuss key regulators of cytosolic sensor proteins and viral proteins based on experimental evidence.\n",

            "Abstract: Viruses replicate and proliferate in host cells while continuously adjusting to and modulating the host environment. They encode a wide spectrum of multifunctional proteins, which interplay with and modify proteins in host cells. Viral genomes were chronologically the first to be sequenced. However, the corresponding viral proteomes, the alterations of host proteomes upon viral infection, and the dynamic nature of proteins, such as post-translational modifications, enzymatic cleavage, and activation or destruction by proteolysis, remain largely unknown. Emerging high-throughput techniques, in particular quantitative or semi-quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of viral and cellular proteomes, have been applied to define viruses and their interactions with their hosts. Here, we review the major areas of viral proteomics, including virion proteomics, structural proteomics, viral protein interactomics, and changes to the host cell proteome upon viral infection.\n",

Infectious virus particles (virions) assembled in a host cell are dynamic, generally metastable particles: They are robust enough to protect the viral genome outside the cell, but are also poised to undergo structural changes and execute mechanochemical actions required for infection of other cells. This chapter provides an introduction to the structural and physical biology of viruses by including: (i) an elementary overview on virions and the structural basis of virus function; (ii) a concise summary on basic techniques used in structural or physical virology; (iii) brief structure-based general descriptions of the different stages in the virus cycle, especially those in which virions and/or their components are involved. These contents may facilitate a better understanding of the specialized subjects treated in the rest of the book. This chapter is also intended as a \"road map\" to help interconnect and integrate in a single picture the different topics described in depth in the 21 monographic chapters in this book.\n",

            "Abstract: Human blood plasma has been reported to possess nonspeci®c antiviral activity. This activity is due to several preexisting naturally occurring molecules that are either active against individual members or a family of viruses. These molecules, however, have not been adequately studied to reveal their molecular structures and mechanisms of action presumably because of their low and nonspeci®c antiviral action. Therefore, their possible role against viraemia remains unknown. Recently, two naturally occurring nonspeci®c broad-spectrum antiviral agents, University of Texas Inhibitor b (UTIb) glycoprotein and high density lipoprotein, have been described in human serum. They are active against DNA and RNA viruses and one of them, UTIb, possesses signi®cant antiviral activity of 40 units/mL. Since preexisting antiviral molecules in serum appear to be the only defence mechanisms available at the onset of viral infection they may have protective signi®cance against viraemia. In view of this potential, we have undertaken to review the properties of these innate viral inhibitory molecules.\n",

            "Abstract: Pan viral DNA microarrays, which can detect known, novel and multiple viral infections, are major laboratory assets contributing to the control of infectious diseases. The large quantity of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) found in tissue samples is thought to be a major factor contributing to the comparatively lower sensitivity of detecting RNA viruses, as a sequence-independent PCR is used to amplify unknown samples for microarray analysis. This study aimed to determine whether depletion or exclusion of rRNA can improve microarray detection and simplify its analysis. Therefore, two different rRNA depletion and exclusion protocols, RiboMinus TM technology and non-rRNA binding hexanucleotides, were applied to the microarray sample processing and the outcome was compared with those of the sequence-independent amplification protocol. This study concludes that the two procedures, described to deplete or exclude rRNA, have negligible effect on the microarrays detection and analysis and might only in combination with further techniques result in a significant enhancement of sensitivity. Currently, existing protocols of random amplification and background adjustment are pertinent for the purpose of sample processing for microarray analysis.\n",

            "Abstract: Interindividual variability in susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, its transmission, disease progression, and response to antiviral therapy has been attributed to host determinants and variability in multiple genes. Although most people exposed to the virus go on to develop full-blown disease at variable intervals, a proportion of them, labeled as long-term nonprogressors or exposed uninfected, possess 'natural resistance' to infection. A better understanding of genetic and immunologic basis of such a natural resistance to infection would bear important implications in designing therapeutic vaccine designs. The genetic variants that could influence susceptibility to HIV-1 and limit AIDS vary in different populations and among individuals. Meta-analyses of large cohort studies have identified numerous 'AIDS restriction genes' that regulate HIV cell entry (particularly chemokine coreceptors and their ligands), acquired and innate immunity (major histocompatibility complex, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, and cytokines), and others [tripartite interaction motif 5 a (TRIM5a) and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G] that influence outcome of HIV infection. Studies carried out in the Indian population with regard to genetic polymorphisms in chemokine receptors have shown that (i) the protective CCR5 D32 variant is rare, (ii) CCR5HHE carrying *59402A is associated with increased likelihood of infection and development of AIDS, and (iii) the Indian population generally has low CCL3L1 copy numbers ($2.3). These data have implications in developing screening tests that could identify people at higher or lower risk of infection and rate of disease progression, predict vaccine responsiveness in clinical trials and understand the pathogenic mechanisms.\n",

            "Abstract: In the present study, we evaluated the viability of non-enveloped viruses, minute virus of mice (MVM) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), and enveloped-viruses, influenza A virus (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), on surfaces. We also investigated the impact of the initial concentration of proteins and sodium chloride on the persistence of infectious CVB4 on surfaces. Viral suspensions (>10 4.5 TCID 50 ) were applied to petri dish lids and dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet. The recovered viral preparations were titered on appropriate cell lines. Enveloped viruses persisted for less than 5 days while CVB4 and MVM persisted for weeks. However, repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension had a stronger virucidal effect on CVB4 than on H1N1 and HSV-1. These repetitive cycles had no effect on the infectious titer of MVM. When exposed to drying, the initial concentrations of bovine serum albumin (from 0 to 90 mg mL −1 ), fetal calf serum (from 0 to 100%), and sodium chloride (from 0 to 300 mg mL −1 ) affected the viability of CVB4. CVB4 was more likely to be inactivated by drying in a protein-rich medium, whereas the impact of drying was reduced in the presence of sodium chloride. The results of the present study demonstrated that the resistance of viruses to drying, as suggested by iterative drying, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral subpopulations, but was influenced by media compositions and component concentrations, as illustrated in the model of CVB4.\n",

            "Abstract: Viruses can have a devastating effect despite their small genomes. All RNA viruses encode proteins that are essential for structural components and replication, and most encode proteins that function to circumvent host antiviral responses 1-3 . This limited number of proteins is sufficient to ensure the entry, replication and subsequent spread of the virus. However, viruses do not self-propagate and depend on various host-cell functions to complete their life cycle. The processes of viral entry, the triggering and regulation of the host antiviral response and subsequent viral replication together result in an intricate series of interactions between virus and host. Much can be learnt about the nature and complexities of these interactions by global profiling of the transcriptional changes in host cells that occur during viral infection (BOX 1).\n",
            " In this Review, we discuss how functional genomic and systems-biology approaches are contributing to our understanding of interactions between RNA viruses and the host, of viral pathogenesis and of host immunity to infection. Rather than providing a comprehensive literature review, we present examples of how these approaches are providing insight into the interaction of viruses with innate immune defence mechanisms, the evaluation of therapeutics that target these pathways and the crucial balance between protective immune responses and immunopathology. In addition, we describe how genomic approaches are being applied to vaccine evaluation and design, and how these approaches can be combined with other high-throughput technologies to provide an improved and integrated systems-biology view of virus infection.\n",

Among these is influenza virus, for which the looming threat of a new pandemic and concerns regarding therapeutic and vaccine preparedness have stimulated exciting new research efforts. We also review findings relating to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, for which genomic analyses are being used to shed light on the response of patients to treatment with type I interferons (IFNs) and the relationship between HCV replication and liver disease. In addition, we highlight studies of West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Ebola virus, all of which have revealed previously undescribed strategies used by these viruses to regulate innate immunity. Finally, we discuss how genomic approaches are being applied to vaccine evaluation and how genomics is being combined with other high-throughput approaches to provide a systems-biology view of virus-host interactions.\n",

Some manage to evade host antiviral defences, whereas others elicit an aberrant or disproportional immune response. Both scenarios can result in the disruption of intracellular signalling pathways and significant pathology in the host. Systems-biology approaches are increasingly being used to study the processes of viral triggering and regulation of host immune responses. By providing a global and integrated view of cellular events, these approaches are beginning to unravel some of the complexities of virus-host interactions and provide new insights into how RNA viruses cause disease.\n"
