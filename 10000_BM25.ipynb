Workers\n","Body Text: Without a vaccine or antiviral therapy for the newly recognized COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing may be the only current means to effectively slow the spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Most states have enacted shelter in place orders to reduce an individual's risk of infection. But, social distancing is not an option for many, including the millions of healthcare workers still providing important and necessary healthcare. According to a recent survey conducted by the Physicians Foundation, doctors in general see an average of 20 patients per day outside of the current epidemic in addition to interactions with their healthcare team. 1 Healthcare providers rely on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of infections from their patients or to other patients. Appropriate PPE has been shown to be effective at reducing transmission of many severe respiratory illnesses by up to 90%. 2, 3 In the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, most spread in the United States has come from community spread. Given healthcare workers cannot always practice social distancing, they are at increased risk of community exposure.\n"," Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n"," Unfortunately, PPE such as procedural masks and N95 respirators are currently in short supply, leading to increased concerns on how to best allocate these precious resources. 4 There is little guidance on when to implement universal masking protocols and when these protocols can be de-escalated as the epidemic wanes. Universal masking protocols are particularly valuable when the disease prevalence is such that the probability of transmission reaches certain thresholds. The objective of our research was to develop a decision-support tool for hospital leadership to understand the community exposure risk for healthcare workers during this rapidly evolving epidemic and allow for guidance around universal masking PPE decisions.\n"," Our methods to estimate the probability of transmission from an asymptomatic communitydwelling patient are based on probability theory. We hypothesized that the probability of transmission is the product of the prevalence of asymptomatic cases in the community (i.e. the risk of contact with an asymptomatic patient) and probability of transmission per contact [i.e.\n"," Pr(Transmission per Contact) = Prevalence asymptomatic * Pr(Transmission)]. We assumed a constant probability of transmission of 5% per contact. This was based on a review of the current research estimating transmission rates to be between 2% and 20%. 5 To account for the rapidly evolving nature of the epidemic, we allowed our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic infections in the community to vary from 0 to 40%.\n"," We then used joint probabilities to extrapolate from our per contact estimate to a daily risk of infection by number of contacts (i.e. 1-[1-Pr(Transmission per Contact)] k , where k=number of daily contacts). Based on prior research, we estimated daily risks for providers seeing between 1 and 30 contacts per day. For the purposes of interpretation, we assume contacts to be in line with Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of \"being within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)\". 6 To provide policy implementation guidance for hospital administrators and healthcare workers, we developed a heatmap graphic of individual daily risk of transmission from an asymptomatic community-dwelling patient depending on the number of contacts per day. We present this information for providers both with and without PPE, assuming an 90% reduction in transmission risk if PPE such as procedural masks or N95 respirators are used.\n"," The results of our analyses are presented in Table 1 . As would be expected, when the prevalence of asymptomatic cases is low, the probability of transmission from an asymptomatic community case is low. For example, we estimate that 1 out of every 500 healthcare workers who are not using PPE and that encounter 20 asymptomatic patients or coworkers per day will contract the infection when the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in the community is less than 250 out of 100,000.\n"," Without the use of PPE or social distancing, there is a 0.05% increase in the probability of transmission from an asymptomatic community infection for every 1% increase in asymptomatic prevalence in the community. In contrast, with PPE use and assuming a 90% reduction in risk of transmission, there is a 0.007% increase in the probability of transmission for every 1% increase in asymptomatic prevalence in the community, thus an 6.8-fold reduction.\n"," Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n"," As of early April 2020, evidence suggests that as many as 50% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, although this estimate is still fluid. 7 Our goal was to develop a tool to help hospital leadership and healthcare providers estimate the daily risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from an asymptomatic community-dwelling patient or coworker. We believe this tool will be of great interest to healthcare providers and hospital leadership as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to develop in our communities. It could be used to inform policy and procedural workflows in the healthcare setting during this and other pandemics.\n"," This decision-support tool can be used as follows. If half of all infections are asymptomatic, then the population prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 is roughly equivalent to the prevalence of known COVID-19 cases in a particular community assuming universal testing is available. As an example, if there are 100 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people (0.1%) in a community, then the estimated prevalence of asymptomatic patients would also be approximately 100 per 100,000 (0.1%). Our tool in Table 1 could then be used to estimate the risk that 1 out of every 1,000 healthcare providers who see 20 patients per day without PPE would contract SARS-CoV-2.\n"," With the use of PPE, this risk would drop to 3 out of every 10,000 providers contracting SARS-CoV-2 from an asymptomatic community-dwelling patient.\n"," One important limitation of our analysis is the inability to account for the unique clustering and networks of contacts among healthcare providers and patients. Our methods assume random mixing with patients from the community who are equally at risk of being asymptomatic. We also do not assume repeated contacts or clustering of contacts which are arguably more common in a healthcare setting. Ultimately, patient-provider and provider-provider interactions in the Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\n"," real-world are complex and difficult to model but random mixing has been shown to provide acceptable estimates for epidemics when the number of contacts or probability of transmission is high. 8 Our results likely represent a conservative estimate of the risk of transmission in the healthcare environment. Another limitation of this study is that it assumes each healthcare system would have some estimates of community or seroprevalence available in order to utilize this approach. However, such estimates may be aggregated at different levels and may vary in accuracy.\n"," In summary, this risk prediction tool can be used to help hospital leadership determine when is the best time to recommend increased utilization of PPE, such as institution of universal masking protocols given the prevalence of asymptomatic cases in their community. This approach could also allow for flexibility in modifying such protocols as risk increases or decreases over time.\n"," This information can be used throughout the epidemic to determine when de-escalation of these protocols should begin.\n"," Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, this period has also coincided with the second pandemic wave in these regions, sparking a heated debate about the role of in-person schooling for community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19.\n"," To limit COVID-19 transmission in school settings, existing evidence highlights the importance of maintaining low levels of transmission in the surrounding communities and adopting recommended mitigation strategies such as universal face mask use and hybrid attendance models to limit crowding in classrooms (Honein, Barrios and Brooks, 2021) .\n"," Nonetheless, this evidence refers primarily to settings with low levels of in-person school attendance and varying levels of community transmission.\n"," In Canada, levels of community transmission were low when schools opened in Fall 2020.\n"," On the contrary, back-to-school policies were quite heterogenous, notably with respect to mask mandates and mode of instruction (fully in person / with optional distance learning).

Nonetheless, prolonged school closures have serious negative implications for children's health and development (Kuhfeld et al. 2020; Hertz and Barrios, 2020; ECDC, 2020; Chanchlani et al., 2020) . For this latter reason, in Fall 2020 in-person schooling and avoiding large-scale school closures have been a priority in Canada as elsewhere.\n"," Return to in-person schooling has sparked a heated debate about how schools can operate safely as the pandemic unfolds. As embedded in the World Health Organization's recommendations, two main conditions need to be satisfied to do so: community transmission of COVID-19 should be maintained at low levels through appropriate policy measures (such as restrictions on indoor gatherings); and recommended mitigation strategies in schools should be in place (WHO, 2020a; 2020b) . These measures include cohorting (keeping students and staff in small groups or \"bubbles\" that do not mix); the universal use of masks; limiting physical presence in classroom in order to reduce crowding; and ensuring adequate and appropriate ventilation.\n"," Large-scale, population-based studies on the role of these conditions for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between school settings and surrounding communities come primarily from the United States (Honein, Barrios and Brooks, 2020) . Notably, given almost universal face mask use and low levels of exclusively in-person schooling (less than 20 percent of school districts), a recent national assessment found that increases in COVID-19 incidence and percentage of positive test results among adults were not preceded by increases in the school-aged population 0-24 years old (US Department of Health and Human Services / Center for Disease Control, 2020). 1 In other terms, levels of COVID-19 transmission in school settings were not a contributing factor of community transmission, but rather reflected it given that recommended mitigation strategies were widely adopted. Similar findings applied to settings with varying levels of pre-existing community transmission (Goldhaber et al., 2020) .\n"," Since only a small proportion of US primary and secondary students attended school exclusively in person during Fall 2020, it is currently unknown how the association between inperson school attendance and COVID-19 transmission varies when different mitigation strategies (notably universal face mask use and distance/hybrid learning) are in place. We shed light on this issue by presenting data on trends in COVID-19 weekly incidence among school-aged children 0-19 years old vis-à-vis other age groups during Fall 2020 in Canada's three largest cities: Montréal, Toronto and Calgary. 2\n"," Although levels of COVID-19 community transmission were low at the beginning of the school year in the three cities considered, back-to-school plans were quite different.

For Montréal, they were extracted from aggregate counts of COVID-19 cases released in weekly reports by the Direction régionale de santé publique 4 . For Toronto and Calgary, individual-level case report data were available from, respectively, Ontario Health 5 and Alberta Health 6 .\n"," Following a standard methodology (US Department of Health and Human Services / Center for Disease Control, 2020), COVID-19 case data were analyzed to describe trends in weekly incidence of the disease among children, adolescents and young adults (aged 0-19 years) between August 18, 2020 and January 12, 2021. Due to data availability, children and young people could be stratified only in two age groups (0-9 and 10-19 years old), which do not align perfectly with educational groupings (kindergarden, primary and secondary). COVID-19 weekly incidence is expressed as cases per 100,000. Population estimates used in calculating incidence were obtained from Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2020).\n"," At the end of August 2020, weekly reported incidence of COVID-19 was under 30 per 100,000 in Montréal, Toronto and Calgary (see Table 1 ). Public health measures to maintain low levels of community transmission (notably restrictions on mass and social gatherings) were implemented in Montréal and Toronto in early October 2020. As a result, the second wave of COVID-19 hit first and progressed faster in Calgary than in the other two cities, where it picked up speed only in late October. However, Alberta implemented strict public health measures to reduce community transmission in early December 2020 so that, for the week of December 29 to January 4, COVID-19 weekly incidence was 356.9 cases per 100,000 in Montréal, 165.9 cases per 100,000 in Toronto, and 153.5 cases per 100,000 in Calgary.\n"," All rights reserved.

The proportion of confirmed infections under age 20 was higher in Québec than in Alberta, even though this subgroup represents a larger share of the population in the former than the latter case (see Table   1 ). Indeed, the distribution of COVID-19 cases by age in each city at the end of the 2020 Fall term results from the evolution of weekly incidence in different age groups (Figure 1) . In Toronto and Calgary, trends in children and adolescents aged 0-19 years paralleled those among adults. On the contrary, in Montréal increases in incidence among adults 30-49 years old were preceded by increases among school-aged children, especially those aged 10-19 years. These increases were little impacted by the mitigation strategies introduced in schools in early October, which included mask mandates in secondary school classrooms and the interruption of sports and extracurricular activities. 7 Once COVID-19 transmission among 10-19 years old 'spilled over' to 30-49 years old, we observe increases in COVID-19 incidence across all other age groups, resulting in an exponential increase of the overall incidence of the disease. In Montréal, transmission of COVID-19 in school-aged children thus does not seem the consequence of community transmission because, in that case, we would expect an increase in incidence for 10-19 years old at the same rate as the incidence in 30-49 years old, like we observe in Toronto and Calgary. 7 The public health measure introduced in early October that had the greatest impact on COVID-19 weekly incidence was closing of bars and restaurants, which implied a drop in transmission among 20-29 years old.

The case of Calgary underscores the importance of optional distance learning for limiting spillover effects from school-aged children to other age groups. Indeed, in spite of the lack of public health measures to limit community transmission of COVID-19 for most of the Fall semester, in Calgary weekly incidence in 0-19 years has mirrored transmission in other age groups, notably 30-49 years old, like in Toronto. Montréal provides an extreme example of the negative consequences on COVID-19 incidence of not implementing recommended migration strategies when reopening schools, even when public health measures such as gatherings restrictions are in place to maintain low levels of community transmission. Our findings for Montréal are in line with data from the UK Office for National Statistics, which shows that the prevalence of infection among children aged 2-16 years rose above the prevalence for all other age groups before the 2020 Christmas break (Gurdasani et al., 2021) .\n"," In Montréal, it could be argued that trends in COVID-19 incidence among school-aged children may overstate the role of in-person schooling since they might reflect transmission in this age group occurring outside school walls, for instance during sport activities and other social gatherings. This is unlikely to be the case for a number of reasons, however. First, results from an ongoing study on social contacts indicates that, when they reopened in September 2020, schools became the main place of interaction for children and adolescents age 0-19 (INSPQ, 2021) .

Third, in related work, we have identified that Montreal boroughs with the highest incidence of COVID-19 among 0-19 years old are located in health regions with the highest number of schools reporting cases of COVID-19 and the highest number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in these schools (Bignami et al., 2020) . Lastly, Figure 1 shows that, one week after schools closed for the Christmas break (between December 22 and 29), COVID-19 weekly incidence declined among 0-9 and 10-19 years old, while it was still rising exponentially in all other age groups.\n"," Existing studies indicate that schools can operate safely as the pandemic unfolds by adopting appropriate public health measure to maintain low levels of COVID-19 community transmission and recommended mitigation strategies in schools such as universal masking and hybrid learning.\n"," The role of these strategies has been studied at varying levels of community transmission, but at low prevalence of exclusively in-person schooling. Our findings thus complement the available evidence regarding risk for transmission associated with in-person schooling in important ways.\n"," Mandatory in-person schooling without universal mask mandates (which remain limited to children in grade 5 and higher) have contributed to increase community transmission in Montréal.\n"," This has been in spite of partial lockdown measures in place since early October 2020, which include the suspension of school sports programs and tight restrictions on mass, social and indoor gatherings (including dining in restaurants).

First, this is a comparative case study, which is inherently limited to a degree due to the complexity of the variation in mitigation measures at all levels between them. We believe, however, that the comparisons are strong enough to support the inferences drawn here concerning the importance of school mitigation strategies in limiting COVID-19 transmission. This is especially because COVID-19 incidence is likely underestimated in children, especially at younger ages, in part because milder illness and a higher fraction of asymptomatic infections are associated with decreased testing and case finding (Fisman et al., 2021) . The second study limitation is that, since data were not available for Montréal and Calgary, we could not assess trends in test positivity by age. Finally, we could not evaluate trends in COVID-19 incidence among teachers and school staff members, because in Canada cases are not routinely reported by occupations other than health care workers.\n","Score: 3.5245270184258373\n","\n","Title: SARS-CoV-2 Transmission and Impacts of Unvaccinated-Only Testing in Populations of Mixed Vaccination Status\n","Body Text: Introduction SARS-CoV-2 has created a pandemic that is beginning to be countered in some areas by widespread vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines are not only extremely effective at preventing severe disease (vaccine efficacy, VE > 90%, [1] ), but they also decrease susceptibility to infection (VE S ) and further decrease rates of onward transmission (VE I ). In spite of these reductions, so-called vaccine breakthrough infections and subsequent transmission have been widely documented [2] , raising the question of how to further mitigate transmission in partially vaccinated populations.\n"," Prior to the approval of COVID-19 vaccines, transmission mitigation via consistent population testing was shown to be an effective approach to break chains of transmission and decrease the burden of COVID-19 using both RT-PCR [3] [4] [5] and rapid antigen testing [5, 6] . Specifically, testing is effective at the community level because it decreases transmission from individuals who are already infected [5, 7] . However, this means that the impact of testing focused only on the unvaccinated population, as has been proposed [8] [9] [10] , may be limited by the extent to which transmission is driven by the unvaccinated population.\n"," Complicating matters further, the role of vaccines in reducing transmission is complex and changing. First, VE S and VE I vary depending on which vaccine was administered [11] . Second, both VE S and VE I wane with time since vaccination [12] [13] [14] , but may also be boosted to higher levels for those receiving an additional dose [15] . Third, those who have experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection also show decreased risks of infection and transmission [11] , not only providing partial protection to those who are unvaccinated and previously infected, but augmenting protection for those who are vaccinated and previously infected [15] . Thus, the relative estimates of risk reductions due to vaccination, prior infection, or both, as well as the sizes of the populations falling into each category of immunity, will affect transmission dynamics-with or without testing.\n"," In this study, we model the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in populations of mixed vaccination status, focusing on two critical questions. First, how do vaccinated and unvaccinated populations each contribute to community spread, and how do those contributions vary with rates of vaccination and prior infection? Second, how do testing programs focused on unvaccinated individuals alone affect community spread? Our study's goals are not to make perfectly calibrated predictions but instead to elucidate more general principles of transmission and unvaccinated-only testing in partially vaccinated populations. As such, our analyses consider a wide range of parameters and scenarios.\n"," High vaccination rates drive total infections down, increase the proportion of breakthrough infections, and shift the drivers of transmission constant rate of exposure, with infection-acquired or vaccine-acquired immunity providing partial protection against subsequent infection. Because precise estimates of the basic reproductive number R 0 vary by context and over time, our analyses consider values inclusive of possible non-pharmaceutical interventions like masking and physical distancing, and thus range from 4 to 6. In our baseline modeling scenario, vaccines were assumed to reduce susceptibility to infection by VE S = 65% and the likelihood of transmission to others by VE I = 35%, values which land within plausible literature estimates for the effectiveness of two doses of mRNA vaccine in the absence of dramatic waning and without boosting [11, 15, 16] . Though less often studied in the literature, we assumed that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection would lead to 63% and 13% decreases in risk of infection and transmission based on a statistical model relating immunity to neutralization [15] , and that hybrid immunity would be superior to either vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. See Materials and Methods and Supplementary Table S1 for a complete description of the model and parameters.\n"," In a modeled population of N = 20, 000 with 58% vaccination rate (corresponding to U.S. estimates as of Nov. 4, 2021 [17] ) and 35% past infection rate, outbreaks still occurred, despite assuming a partially mitigated delta variant (R 0 = 4) and immunity from past infection, vaccination, or both. During the ensuing 3 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review) outbreak, 59% of total infections occurred in unvaccinated individuals, despite making up only 42% of the population (Fig. 1c) , with the remaining 41% of infections occurring among the vaccinated (breakthrough infections). Furthermore, the peak burden of disease occurred first in the unvaccinated community and then one week later in the vaccinated community (Fig. 1b) , a known consequence of disease dynamics in populations with heterogeneous susceptibility and transmissibility [18, 19] . By categorizing transmission events into four distinct modes (Fig 1a) , we observe that infections in both communities were driven predominantly and consistently by the unvaccinated community (U → U , U → V ; Fig. 1d ), but that there was nevertheless some transmission from the vaccinated community (breakthrough transmission). These differences occurred despite a \"well mixed\" modeling assumption-namely, that neither type of individual is more or less likely to associate with a member of their own group vs the other group.\n"," Vaccination and past infection rates vary widely across the U.S. [17] and the world [20] due to impacts of both vaccine availability [20] and refusal [21] , as well as the success or failure of transmission mitigation policies. We therefore asked how a population's vaccination and past infection rates would affect our observations about total infections, breakthrough infections, and the relative impacts of the four modes of transmission. This analysis revealed three important points.\n"," First, our results reinforce the fact that increased vaccination rates lead to decreased total infections, both before and after the herd immunity threshold at R eff = 1 (Fig. 1c) . Moreover, when large proportions of the population are also partially protected by immunity from prior infection, the vaccination levels at which R eff = 1 decrease considerably (Fig. 2a) . For instance, increasing prior infection rates from 35% to 50% decreases the required vaccination rate for R eff = 1 from 87% to 80%. Combinations of immunity from past infection and vaccination thus have the potential to create a herd immunity frontier, beyond which transmission is no longer self-sustaining even in the absence of testing.\n"," Second, as vaccination rates increased, the fraction of infections classified as vaccine breakthroughs increased (Fig. 1c) , creating a transition point such that when 68% of the population was vaccinated, 50% of 4 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review)\n"," The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted December 8, 2021. ;  all infections were breakthrough infections under our baseline modeling conditions. To determine whether this transition point of 68% was sensitive to the precise fraction of the population with immunity from past infection (35%, Fig. 1 ), we varied the fraction with infection-acquired immunity between 0% and 100%, finding that the 50/50 breakthrough infection transition occurred between 63% and 75% vaccine coverage (Fig. 2b) . Thus, our results set the expectation that increasing vaccination rates will decrease total infections, but a higher proportion of those infections will be breakthroughs, irrespective of levels of immunity due to prior infection.\n"," Third, as vaccination rates increased, the unvaccinated community ceased to be the primary driver of transmission. Under our baseline modeling conditions (R 0 = 4, 35% with infection-acquired immunity), this transition occurred when 80% or more of the population was vaccinated (Fig. 1e ). When we varied the fraction of the population with infection-acquired immunity between 0% and 100%, this transition point varied from 76% to 82% (Fig 2c) . Thus, while COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are likely to remain concentrated primarily in unvaccinated populations, only a minority of infections will occur in, or be driven by, the unvaccinated community when vaccine coverage is sufficiently high. Note that this implies that unvaccinated individuals living in highly vaccinated communities will still be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and thus remain at risk of infection.\n"," These findings are driven by reductions in susceptibility and infectiousness arising from vaccination, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or both. However, quantitative estimates of those reductions vary depending on which vaccine was administered [14] , time since vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection [12] [13] [14] , whether an additional \"booster\" dose was given [15] , and the variant circulating at the time of the study [22, 23] . We therefore sought to determine how our findings might change under different sets of assumptions about vaccine effectiveness by comparing our baseline scenario (VE S = 0.65, VE I = 0.35) with a waning/low immunity scenario (VE S = 0.5, VE I = 0.1) and a boosted/high immunity scenario (VE S = 0.8, VE I = 0.6).\n"," To explore the impact of waning and boosted vaccine effectiveness, we simulated outbreaks for all combinations of vaccination and infection-acquired immunity rates under the three VE scenarios. Across simulations, we found that total infections were well predicted by calculating R eff at the start of each simulation. In particular, outbreaks were small when vaccination or past infection rates crossed the herd immunity threshold (R eff < 1). When R eff > 1, total infections monotonically increased as R eff increased (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The herd immunity threshold was impossible to cross with vaccination alone in the waning VE scenario with partially mitigated transmission (R 0 = 4, Waning and boosting assumptions altered the proportions of infections occurring in, and transmission from, the unvaccinated vs vaccinated communities. All else being equal, waning immunity led to increased fractions of breakthrough infections and breakthrough transmission from the vaccinated community, while boosted immunity led to decreases of both. In turn, population vaccination rates at which the majority of infections were breakthroughs shifted down (waning; Fig. 3a ), while vaccination rates at which the majority of transmission was driven by vaccinated individuals shifted up (boosting; Fig. 3c ).\n"," Among the three transition points identified in transmission dynamics, we observe that, in each VE scenario, R eff is driven by both vaccination and past infection rates, as evidenced by curvature in R eff = 1 isoclines (Fig. 3 , black lines). In contrast, isoclines representing the transition points between majorityunvaccinated vs majority-breakthrough infections (Fig. 3 , light green lines) and the transition points between majority-unvaccinated vs majority-breakthrough transmission (Fig. 3 , dark green lines) are relatively 5 .

These findings suggest that the relative proportions of breakthrough infections and breakthrough transmission are driven by vaccination rates and VE, but not by rates of past infection or proximity to herd immunity; indeed, after the herd immunity threshold, both infection and transmission isoclines show essentially no variation. These observations suggest that unvaccinated-only testing programs, which decrease rates of U → U and U → V transmission, may be highly effective only in regimes where transmission is driven by the unvaccinated (i.e. to the \"left\" of dark green isoclines, Fig. 3 ), an intuition we now explore in detail.\n"," To explore the impact of unvaccinated-only testing on population transmission, we modified our simulations so that a positive test would result in an unvaccinated individual isolating to avoid infecting others [5, 24] . We considered test sensitivity equivalent to RT-PCR with a one-day delay between sample collection and diagnosis under two testing paradigms: weekly testing with 99% compliance and weekly testing with 50% compliance-a value which reflects observed compliance with a weekly testing mandate in a university setting [3] .\n"," Our simulations show that the benefits of an unvaccinated-only testing program fall into one of three categories, depending on the population vaccination rate and transmission dynamics. These categories align with three distinct regions in parameter space, denoted in Fig. 4 as regions I, II and III. In region I, testing is insufficient to fully control transmission, yet nevertheless markedly reduces total infections (Fig. 4a) . In region II, testing successfully brings transmission under control (Fig. 4b) . In region III, testing has little impact on transmission due to the fact that outbreaks are already mitigated by population immunity and other control measures (Fig. 4c) . Unvaccinated-only testing is therefore impactful in the first two regions, sufficient for transmission control in only the second region, and largely inconsequential to transmission in the third.\n"," .

Total number of infections with no testing (black) and weekly testing with 99% compliance (pink) are shown for 25% (a), 75% (b), and 95% (c) population vaccination rates. (d) Effective reproductive number over various population vaccination rates, where R eff = 1 is denoted by gray dashed line. Testing's impacts fall into three categories (see text) depending on whether vaccination rate falls into region I, II, or III, as annotated. R 0 = 4 and 35% rate of prior infection with baseline VE and immunity parameters (Materials and Methods, Supplementary Table S1 ).\n"," The three regions that correspond to different impacts of testing are separated by boundaries which can be estimated from two analytical calculations of R eff -one which includes the effects of testing and one which does not. The boundary separating regions I and II is given by those parameters for which R eff = 1 with testing, while the boundary separating regions II and III is given by those parameters for which R eff = 1 without testing (Fig. 4d) . Thus, the value of an unvaccinated-only testing program can be evaluated based on which of three regions the current vaccination rate, prior infection rate, and VE fall into.\n"," To illustrate the value of this R eff -based analysis, we considered vaccination rates and prior infection rates ranging from 0-100% and varied VE between waning, baseline, and boosted scenarios. Across scenarios, dramatic relative reductions in infections are concentrated only within the envelope between the boundaries of R eff = 1 with and without testing, i.e., region II (Fig. 5) . Outside of this effective testing envelope, percent reductions in infections decreased markedly, either because unvaccinated-only testing was an insufficient intervention during a rapidly growing outbreak (region I), or because existing population immunity prevented large outbreaks in the first place (region III). Assuming a 35% past infection rate and R 0 = 4, region III appeared only for baseline and boosted vaccine effectiveness assumptions, and only when vaccination rates were approximately 90% or greater (baseline VE) or 75% or greater (boosted VE). Sensitivity analyses show that increasing R 0 to 6, potentially representing pre-pandemic contact rates and the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, cause region III to shrink further. Thus continued testing for SARS-CoV-2 among the unvaccinated may be of limited value, but only when vaccination rates become sufficiently high.\n"," The role of compliance-the fraction of scheduled tests that are actually taken-can also be clarified by examining the three regions of testing impact. Both the simulations and equations for R eff show that increasing compliance from 50% to 99% causes the lower boundary of the effective testing envelope to shift to lower vaccination and prior infection rates, decreasing the size of region I and increasing the size of region II (Fig. 5) . Moreover, increased testing compliance increases the magnitude of infection reductions within both regions, visible as an intensification of color in the infection reduction heatmaps (Fig. 5) . As a result of these observations, we conclude that, in addition to test sensitivity, frequency, and turnaround time [5] , high participation in testing programs is critical to expanding the impact of unvaccinated-only testing programs. However, we also note that testing compliance had little effect in region III where R eff < 1, a result which 7 .

As a consequence, we observe that in the presence of testing, the vaccination rates at which the unvaccinated cease to drive a majority of transmission decrease by 5 to 15 percentage points (Fig. 6b) , with the largest decreases for 99% compliance testing and waning vaccine effectiveness, and the smallest decreases for 50% compliance testing and boosted vaccine effectiveness. In other words, unvaccinated-only testing programs shrink the regime in which the unvaccinated population drives outbreaks.\n"," In contrast, unvaccinated-only testing programs had little effect on the percentage of infections that were breakthroughs. Instead, majority breakthrough regimes remained primarily dependent on vaccination rates and vaccine effectiveness (Fig. 6a) , with transitions to majority-breakthrough infection regimes beginning at 55 to 67% vaccination rates (waning VE), 63 to 75% vaccination rates (baseline VE) and 83 to 84% vaccination rates (boosted VE). We therefore conclude that unvaccinated only testing programs do not markedly alter the expectations of majority-breakthrough infections at high vaccination levels, particularly if VE is low or waning.\n"," . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review) \n"," In this analysis, we find that in communities with mixed vaccination status, routine SARS-CoV-2 testing programs focused on the unvaccinated community can reduce infection, but in a manner dependent on two conditions. First, effective screening testing requires high participation to be most impactful, reinforcing the need for mechanisms to encourage or enforce high participation. Second, when vaccination and past infection rates are high enough to curtail transmission on their own, testing the remaining unvaccinated population averts few infections in both relative and absolute terms. Thus, targeted unvaccinated testing programs lose effectiveness once vaccination rates exceed the threshold at which population immunity and other interventions push R eff below 1. These results echo related work focused on universal testing programs [7] .\n"," The critical vaccination rates, above which unvaccinated-only testing programs provide little transmission reduction, depend on vaccine effectiveness, rates of infection-acquired immunity, and whether transmission is mitigated by other means such as physical distancing and masking. In particular, our analysis suggests that with boosted vaccine effectiveness (VE S = 80%, VE I = 60%) and 35% past infection rates, unvaccinated-only testing is not needed when vaccination rates exceed 70% with other control measures in place (R 0 = 4) or 85% in their absence (R 0 = 6), with lower thresholds possible as rates of past SARS-CoV-2 infection increase. In contrast, with baseline vaccine effectiveness (VE S = 65%, VE I = 35%) and 35% past infection rates, unvaccinated-only testing is not needed only when 85% or more were vaccinated, and only then with other control measures (R 0 = 4). For waning VE scenarios, practically no vaccination rates existed at which testing could cease. Thus, combinations of vaccination, boosting, masking or other mitigation measures, and past infections may allow some communities to cease testing and reallocate limited public health resources elsewhere (including to further increase vaccination rates), but such combinations are practically nonexistent for pre-pandemic contact rates and waning VE.\n"," .

First, when vaccination rates are sufficiently high, a majority of the albeit reduced number of infections will be vaccine breakthrough infections. This fact should come as no surprise, as this transition must occur at some point for any vaccine below 100% effectiveness; our modeling estimates it to take place between 63% and 75% vaccine coverage (baseline VE; 55-67% vaccinated with waning VE; 83-84% vaccinated with boosted VE). Second, while at low vaccination rates, community spread is driven by the unvaccinated population, at higher vaccination rates, community spread is driven by the vaccinated population (Fig. 3) . These vaccination rate transition points separating majority-unvaccinated transmission and majority-breakthrough transmission are driven lower by unvaccinated-only testing programs (Fig. 6) . Taken together, these results suggest that while the overall number of cases in highly vaccinated communities will be low, vaccine breakthrough infections and transmission events from vaccinated individuals should not be surprising-vaccine effectiveness is not 100%. Consequently, in anticipation of continued community transmission even in highly vaccinated communities, those at increased risk of severe COVID-19 should take additional precautions to limit their risk of infection or severe disease.\n"," Our analyses identify two limitations of testing programs in reducing community transmission. First, for a testing program to be effective, testing must have high rates of compliance; weekly testing with 50% compliance-a rate which reflects observed compliance in a population with a weekly testing mandate [3] is likely to be relatively ineffective. Second, the ability of a testing program to prevent community spread is restricted to a limited \"envelope\" of past infection rate and vaccination rate combinations in which R eff without testing is greater than one, and R eff with testing is less than one. However, it is important to note that while our analyses focus on the benefits of testing in reducing transmission, testing also plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment, detection of variants, situational awareness and surveillance, and decreasing pressure on the healthcare system during outbreaks. Furthermore, testing focused on the unvaccinated population may provide additional incentives to get vaccinated and thus avoid regular testing. Our study did not explore the benefits of unvaccinated-only testing mandates for these additional purposes.\n"," Our analysis is limited in at least three different manners. First, our modeling incorporated fixed parameters that are difficult to estimate in practice. For instance, while our analysis considered boosted, baseline, and waning scenarios for vaccines' reductions in susceptibility VE S and infectiousness VE I based on ranges of estimates in the current literature, few studies are available to guide estimates of similar risk reductions associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, with or without vaccination (but see Refs.\n"," [11] and [15] ). Alternative parameter assumptions may be explored via the provided open-source code. Second, we assumed perfect isolation after receiving a positive test result in all testing regimens, effectively removing all infectiousness once a diagnosis is received. Were this assumption to be violated by imperfect or delayed isolation, we predict a proportional loss of testing impact across all scenarios. Third, our model assumed that vaccination and past infection statuses are uncorrelated at the population level, yet they may be anticorrelated due to the protective effects of vaccination or because those with past infection may choose to forgo subsequent vaccination. We similarly assumed no homophily in contact patterns based on vaccination status, yet those who choose to be vaccinated may be more likely to be situated in a social network with others who choose to be vaccinated, and vice versa [25] . Analyses of simulated communities with homophily by vaccination status only slightly increased vaccination rates at which the key transitions discussed above were observed. Finally, our model assumes values of R 0 and immunity associated with the delta variant, but emerging variants such as omicron (identified a week prior to the present writing) may dramatically shift the values of these parameters. These limitations affect the exact vaccination and past infection rates at which the three transitions identified in our study occur, and thus our analyses describe fundamental phenomena but do not 10 .

Other areas of focus include the allocation of scarce personal protective equipment to reduce transmission [26] , the prioritization of vaccines by subpopulation [27] [28] [29] , proactive testing programs in specific workplace structures [30] or contact networks [7] , immunity \"passport\" programs [24] , or immune shielding strategies [31] . Our contribution to this literature is primarily to show that testing programs focused on the unvaccinated will substantially reduce transmission only with strict adherence, and only until population immunity is sufficiently high as to obviate the need for this form of targeted intervention.\n"," Our analyses are based on a continuous time ordinary differential equation compartmental model with Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) compartments, stratified into vaccinated V and unvaccinated U groups. In addition to tracking infections among these two groups separately, we also tracked infections from both groups separately, enabling us to investigate four modes of transmission: from U to U , from U to V , from V to U , and from V to V . In all simulations, we used a constant total population size of N = 20, 000 and denoted the vaccinated fraction of the population with φ.\n"," To incorporate the possibility that individuals may have experienced prior infections, we further subdivided U and V into SARS-CoV-2 naive and SARS-CoV-2 experienced subpopulations, such that a fraction ψ of each was assumed to be previously infected and 1 − ψ remains naive. For notation, we denote the subpopulations of U to be u (unvaccinated, naive) and x (unvaccinated, experienced/prior infection), and the subpopulations of V to be v (vaccinated, naive) and h (vaccinated, experienced). We assumed that vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 experience statuses were fixed at the start of each simulation and immutable throughout, such that there was no ongoing vaccination, and individuals who were infected and recovered during each simulation were not reassigned to SARS-CoV-2 experienced status [32] .\n"," We denote the protective effects of immunity as XE, VE, HE, expressed as reductions in risk due to prior infection alone (x), vaccination alone (v), or prior infection and vaccination (i.e. so-called \"hybrid\" immunity; h), respectively. Immunity was modeled to (i) decrease the risk of infection upon exposure, and (ii) decrease the risk of transmission upon infection, placing our vaccine and immunity model in the broader category of leaky models [33] . Reductions in the risk of infection upon exposure (XE S , VE S , HE S ) and reductions in the risk of transmission when infected (XE I , VE I , HE I ) were parameterized separately, based on ranges of estimates from the literature. See Table S1 . Due to broad uncertainty in these effects over time since exposure [11, 32] or vaccination [11] [12] [13] , by vaccine manufacturer and schedule [14, 15, 34, 35] , by context [23, 36] , and by variant [15] , our analyses intentionally consider a range of values.

We estimated increased rates of removal using a previously established method that takes into account (i) the calibrated trajectories of viral loads within individual infection [37] , (ii) the relationship between viral load and infectiousness [5] , (iii) the frequency of testing, (iv) the test's analytical sensitivity (i.e. limit of detection) and turnaround time [24] , and (v) testing compliance and valid sample rates, i.e. the fraction of scheduled or mandated tests which actually produce a valid sample [3] . In particular, our adaptation takes a previous model [5, 24] and updates viral load dynamics for the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 [38, 39] , the dominant variant at the time of the present analysis. To incorporate the effectiveness of testing θ, we reduce the duration of infectiousness 1/γ by a factor (1 − θ) . Parameter values for θ are found in Table S1 , and are based on weekly PCR testing with a one-day turnaround, analytical limit of detection of 10 3 RNA copies per ml sample, and compliance rates of 50% (as in [3] ) or 99% (as in [6] ). These values assume that individuals immediately and successfully isolate upon receiving a positive diagnosis. We note that estimated effects of rapid antigen tests (with higher analytical limits of detection, but zero turnaround time) are highly similar to PCR testing under the assumptions above, provided that testing program frequencies and compliance rates are identical [5] .\n"," Inclusive of all effects introduced above, the forces of infection are given by\n"," where i = {x, v, h}, and reductions in susceptibility due to immunity are given by (RR S ) i = {XE S , VE S , HE S }, correspondingly.

We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID-19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated.\n"," We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow-up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population.\n"," Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID-19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22-33 contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests/million population per week using 1/16 pooling of samples.\n"," Screening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system. 2 Background Worldwide, countries are implementing measures to contain COVID-19. Internationally, empirical data demonstrates that all countries that have been able to exert substantive control of the COVID-19 pandemic have implemented strong containment and social distancing, combined with extensive surveillance.1-3 Australia, too, has achieved success with its strong containment measures. Community compliance with such measures, estimated at over 80%4, along with strong border controls and wider testing and management of identified cases and contacts, has meant that case numbers have dropped from a peak of over 450 cases, to less than 21 new cases per day throughout the country as of 17th March 20205.\n"," Once strong containment, social distancing and other measures have been successful in reducing transmission, enhanced surveillance systems are needed which are capable of confirming that transmission has been eliminated from the community, and which can also detect and control early transmission resulting from reintroductions of disease into the community once containment measures begin to be lifted. Some modelling has raised concerns that where measures to control COVID-19 have been successful, there is likely to be a resurgence of community transmission when measures are lifted, and this cannot be contained by surveillance of hospital presentations6. Broader community-based surveillance and contact-tracing is a proven strategy for enabling early detection in infectious disease outbreaks7 and has the potential to address the resurgence demonstrated by modelling that only includes hospital-based case detection. Moreover, testing capacity, as well as case and contact follow up interventions, are continuing to improve internationally, meaning that more sensitive and sophisticated surveillance systems are increasingly possible.8-10\n"," Currently, there is uncertainty on how best to achieve exhaustive identification of all transmission once prevalence is very low or undetectable through current surveillance strategies, and to detect and manage any reintroduction of community transmission once containment has been achieved. The World Health Organization, although recommending surveillance of influenza-like illness and severe respiratory illness, identifies these areas as a knowledge gap in the monitoring of community transmission.2 This lack of evidence hampers control efforts not only because it limits effective management of transmission, but because it contributes to a reluctance to implement strong containment and social distancing, due to fears that such measures would be required for extended periods.11,12 These fears can be addressed by a clear strategy for managing subsequent resurgences of community transmission once such measures are lifted, without the need for reinstitution of strong containment measures.\n"," WHO representatives have stated that ongoing control of COVID-19 following lifting of containment and social distancing measures will require identification and elimination of all transmission chains. 13 Exhaustive detection and elimination of community transmission chains is standard practice in management of high-risk pathogen outbreaks such as Ebola Virus Disease,7,14 and this experience provides useful guidance for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic.1 Although there are factors that contribute to COVID-19 being more difficult to control with such strategies (e.g. higher proportion of asymptomatic disease, shorter serial interval), there are also factors that mean it is more amenable to such measures than infections such as influenza (e.g. longer serial interval), which we have accepted as beyond our current capacity to eliminate.\n"," This study evaluates surveillance options and proposes an efficient, feasible and scalable strategy that will:\n"," (a) provide corroborating evidence that community transmission has been eliminated through strong containment measures when notified cases are declining; (b) identify and manage any early resurgence in transmission once these measures are lifted; (c) address current constraints in surveillance such as limited testing capacity; and (d) identify other response priorities that are critical to enhanced surveillance.\n"," A range of options are assessed, and efficient strategies are recommended, including a summary of the structure and requirements for such a public health surveillance system. Given constraints on testing, we provide a range of scenarios and related testing and follow-up requirements to allow the proposed strategy to be scaled up and tailored to available capacity. This includes assessing test performance for varying COVID-19 prevalence, and assessing the benefits and costs of pooling, a strategy now being implemented in some settings with limited test materials15, 16 . Although increasing the number that can be tested, pooling may decrease sensitivity17, and is of varied efficiency depending on disease prevalence, thus we sought to assess the impact of such considerations.\n"," Based on current and potentially effective surveillance strategies from our rapid review, we compare the following three candidate groups for surveillance:\n"," • Group 1: Patients with pneumonia presenting to hospitals • Group 2: Patients with fever plus cough presenting to primary care (either general practices or specialist fever clinics). Fever and cough is recommended by WHO as a general syndromic surveillance case definition2, and has been reported as commonly occurring symptoms in patients with COVID-1918. We therefore used this as the syndromic case definition for identification of suspected symptomatic disease in the community. • Group 3: Asymptomatic community members who may have a higher level of unprotected exposure to the community e.g. supermarket and delivery workers, transport workers,19 essential service staff living in families with children who attend school, and teachers (if schools are open).\n"," The following were estimated for these three groups:\n"," • The estimated number of cases in the community within the same transmission chain as the detected case at the time the detected case presents. • The sensitivity and efficiency of testing these groups for a range of testing capacities and varying prevalence of non-COVID-19 fever and cough patients in primary care, and for varying prevalence of COVID-19 in sentinel populations. • The feasibility of surveillance both qualitatively and quantitatively, including the system requirements for increasing testing and follow-up in these groups for a population prevalence of COVID-19 of 1/20,000. This prevalence was calculated with the following assumptions: Iceland had the highest level of community-based screening globally as at 23/03/20, and a similar epidemiology to Australia. Their general population overall prevalence is 0.86% (48/5571). Prevalence in health care system testing was 425/4197=10%, with 34% of this travel related. We assumed 0.005% weekly period prevalence in community, which is 1/3 of that, since community transmission in Australia has decreased substantially since this time.\n"," Gains from enhanced community surveillance are estimated for two scenarios:\n"," (1) High levels of transmission, in which surveillance is implemented in a context of limited or no containment measures and therefore the reproductive number is assumed to be 2.2,20 (i.e. the situation if most containment measures are lifted following successful elimination) (2) Low levels of transmission, in which surveillance is conducted following lifting of some containment measures that have reduced transmission, with the reproductive number assumed to consequently rise above one to 1.2.\n"," Estimated cases in the community were calculated using a stochastic SEIR model, assuming a four-day incubation period before symptom onset, with transmission occurring during the final day of this period. We assumed three levels of severity: severe cases (20% of all symptomatic cases)21 who are hospitalised, .

In sensitivity analyses, we considered higher rates of asymptomatic infection, ranging up to 50%.23 As hospital surveillance is currently restricted to cases with pneumonia, we assumed a 7-day delay from symptom onset until presentation at hospital in severe cases,24 while a proportion of mild and moderate cases present to primary care two days after developing symptoms. We assume that cases are only infectious for three days (including one day of pre-symptomatic transmission) to replicate serial intervals of around 4-6 days.24\n"," Sensitivity and efficiency of testing strategies was evaluated using the following assumptions to calculate precision of point prevalence estimates and case detection capacity per million population:\n"," • Random sampling of presentations in each group.\n"," • Online syndromic surveillance data in Australia (FluTracker) provides self-reported prevalence of fever and cough on a weekly basis. From 2019 data,25 we expect a peak population prevalence of cough and fever of 3%, with 2% across much of winter and 1% outside winter. With extensive social distancing measures, prevalence of fever and cough due to all causes may decrease by 40%,26 therefore we also assessed 0.6% non-COVID fever and cough prevalence. • We compared primary care presentation rates of 50% and 100% of patients with fever and cough in the community.\n"," We also assessed overall test performance (negative and positive predictive values and false negative and false positive rates) under a range of prevalence values and test performance in terms of sensitivity and specificty. Benefits of pooling of samples were considered by estimating the number of tests required at a given prevalence. We also assessed the relative benefits compared to costs of pooling if pooling were to result in a reduction in sensitivity by comparing a situation of high test sensitivity and no pooling (and therefore reduced number of patients tested) with a range of lower sensitivities and pooling (and therefore a higher number tested but also a higher number of false negatives). Figure 1 presents the number of infected people in the community within a single transmission chain at the time that there is one case detected by primary care (left) or hospital (right) surveillance, assuming hospital detections are severe cases with pneumonia and 50% of all symptomatic cases present to primary care with cough and fever. Primary care surveillance results in fewer undetected cases in the community to be identified through contact tracing: under the high transmission scenario (reproductive number of 2.2) there are a median of 13 infected people in the community when a severe case is detected at the hospital compared to a median of 5 infected people in the community when there is a detection through primary care. Under the low transmission scenario (reproductive number of 1.2) there are a median of 4 infected people in the community when a severe case is detected at the hospital compared to a median of 3 infected people in the community when there is a detection through primary care. If all symptomatic cases present to primary care, there are just 3 infected people to be traced under high transmission and 2 infected people under low transmission. Conversely if 50% of cases are asymptomatic and only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care, there are a median of 6 infected people in the community when there is a detection through primary care at high transmission, and a median of 3 infected people in the community at low transmission.\n"," Efficiency of testing (a) Fever and cough testing in primary care .

Under the most likely assumptions outside of winter (1% fever and cough prevalence), exhaustive testing of all fever and cough patients would be possible with 10,000 samples per million population per week. If COVID-19 cases represent 0.1-1% of these fever and cough patients, population testing could be achieved with 800-2,200 tests per million population by pooling of samples in batches of 16 (Table 3) .\n"," The above results are primarily influenced by the prevalence of non-COVID-19 fever and cough in the general community. Even at much higher or lower prevalence of COVID-19, the overall conclusions remain the same. The main impact of varied community prevalence is on precision (confidence interval size around prevalence estimate), on absolute numbers of cases missed and on efficiency gains through pooling of tests. However, when all fever and cough patients present and testing is exhaustive, the number of COVID-19 community cases missed by screening remains at 0 whatever the COVID-19 community prevalence.\n"," (b) Testing of asymptomatic groups with high-risk contacts Table 2 assesses the estimated prevalence and number of community cases of COVID-19 missed by screening, given varied testing and prevalence of COVID-19 infection in an asymptomatic sentinel population. For all scenarios assessed, the majority of asymptomatic cases are missed by random screening of sentinel populations\n"," Tables 3 and 4 present test performance (negative and positive predictive values, false positive and false negative rates) for COVID-19 prevalence in the tested population of 0.05%-3%, and a range of test characteristics (sensitivity 70%-99.9%, specificity 70%-99.9%). As Table 3 demonstrates, changes in sensitivity do not have marked effects on negative predictive value. However, at higher prevalence, even small changes in the negative predictive value results in substantially more false negatives. Table 4 demonstrates that it is only with very high specificity (99.9%), and relatively high prevalence (>=1%) that most positive tests are true positives. In all other scenarios, most positives are false positives.\n"," We highlight key public health system requirements and factors that may affect capacity to implement enhanced surveillance below:\n"," The fever and cough surveillance strategy provides the opportunity for simple and clear messaging to the community: isolate and get tested if you have fever and cough. This must include all age groups and could be supported with a hotline and community-based support, and draw on the lessons learnt in regards to community engagement from this and current pandemic responses, both internationally and in Australia. (see Discussion for further details)\n"," Where there is limited testing capacity, pooling of samples would reduce the number of tests required per individual to be tested (see Table 3 ). This is now being implemented in some settings.15 This will greatly reduce the need for testing reagents, especially in low prevalence settings. Promising strategies for further enhancing the coverage and feasibility of such testing include self-collection of samples, which has been found to have similar performance to health worker collected samples in initial research on COVID-19 .27\n"," .

Previous studies on influenza have found that self-collection of samples reduced sensitivity (87% sensitivity compared to clinician collected samples).28 As Table 3 demonstrates, even with such a reduction, overall benefits outweigh the costs in terms of false negatives if such reductions in performance are associated with increased testing capacity. Another promising strategy under review is testing of saliva samples, which will both allow self-collection, and also not require equipment such as swabs, which have been another limitation on testing capacity.\n"," For enhanced surveillance to lead to pandemic control, all confirmed cases must be investigated. Contact tracing should be structured based on two groups of contacts: (a) upstream contacts, i.e. those who are the potential source of transmission to the identified case, and (b) downstream contacts, i.e. those likely to have had contact with the case while the case was infectious. Management will vary depending on which type of contact is identified:\n"," (a) Upstream contacts: intensive case finding and testing of these cases, whether symptomatic or not, is important, both with PCR-based testing to identify current infection, and with serology to identify past infection. The model indicates 2 or 3 cases (including the primary case) within the upstream transmission tree once it is detected at primary care with high surveillance (Figures 1  and 2) . Full contact tracing of the entire transmission tree, which would include another 2-3 chains generated by these cases, would thus require around 22-33 contacts traced.29 It is important to note that these contacts could only be identified through upstream contact tracing. (b) Downstream contacts: optimal follow up includes intensive case finding and quarantining of these contacts, with home monitoring (twice daily temperature checks, GPS monitoring of compliance) and PCR testing for active disease once the 14-day quarantine and follow up period concludes to ensure they do not have asymptomatic disease. On average, 11 such contacts per case needing 14 days follow up per week would be expected.29\n"," Although investigation of downstream contacts is part of most surveillance strategies, follow up of upstream contacts is not uniformly undertaken, but is a feature of those settings implementing successful control1,30,31 Investigation of contacts can be supported through training and integration of community volunteer networks into existing surveillance and contact tracing teams. Software may assist considerably in these efforts,18 and, linked to penalties for those found not to be with their phone during random spot checks by authorities, is again an important part of follow up in those settings with effective control.32\n"," Emerging strategies for enhanced surveillance Recent studies have identified a range of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Symptoms such as anosmia and loss of taste appear to be relatively common in those with infection In a recent study based on ongoing community surveillance through online self-report of symptoms, the prevalence of these two symptoms was 59% in those who tested positive for COVID-19, and 19% in those who did not. 33 However, this study did not provide information on the prevalence of anosmia and loss of taste, without fever or cough, in the population testing negative for COVD-19 or in the general population. Once this data is available, it will be possible to assess the feasibility and added value of including anosmia and loss of taste in the surveillance case definitions.\n"," Screening of wastewater for evidence of community transmission is another emerging strategy that is receiving increased attention34 and is another strategy that could provide a useful addition to primary care screening systems. It could also be used to monitor, on an ongoing basis, high risk facilities such as hospitals and aged care facilities in order to identify early transmission in such settings. It appears sensitive, and further assessment of such population-level environmental screening strategies is warranted. However, .

This percent target should be reassessed monthly based on sentinel influenza surveillance systems (e.g. Flutracker, plus additional community-based surveys.) Surveillance system performance should also be validated through, for example, random community-based surveillance for unreported fever and cough at household and in general primary care settings. Fever and cough prevalence has decreased due to social distancing, however as these measures are lifted, it would be expected that prevalence will increase, especially if lifting occurring during winter.\n"," o 100% uptake of screening for fever and cough in sentinel surveillance populations, this can be part of the information collected during sentinel follow-up and monthly fever and cough prevalence surveys recommended above. o Community understanding of testing criteria, attitudes towards uptake of screening, practices related to screening, views on feasibility and burden, support services for enabling screening (again, can be included in sentinel surveillance and surveys)\n"," Indicators of successful progress towards elimination of community transmission, given system coverage, uptake and completeness indicators have all been met:\n"," • 100% of newly reported cases are travel related and/ or known contacts of confirmed cases.\n"," • 100% of newly reported cases are tested on day of symptom onset.\n"," • 100% of newly detected cases have been under quarantine from time of exposure event.\n"," • 100% complete follow up of all contacts. Initially, as the modelling suggests, the number of upstream contacts under follow up per case should be at least 2 times number of downstream contacts under follow up (as there will be 2-3 upstream transmission branches for every identified case, and total number of contacts under follow up per case should be >35, unless there is a clear justification for lower. This figure should also be reviewed regularly, and contact case definitions updated based on serosurveys and screening for viral shedding around identified cases, including in high-risk settings (institutional settings, schools, health care facilities). Complete follow-up includes: o For upstream contacts: PCR and serological testing at time of case detection o For downstream contacts-documented quarantining for 14 days post last contact, linked to PCR testing at end of quarantine period to exclude asymptomatic viral shedding. • 0% hospitalised new cases and/or deaths relative to total new community-acquired cases.35.\n"," Indicators of successful elimination of community transmission, given system coverage, uptake and completeness indicators have all been met:\n"," • 100% of new cases are travel related .

It shows that testing for infection in primary care patients presenting with cough and fever is an efficient, effective and feasible strategy for the detection and elimination of transmission chains.\n"," Increasing uptake of appropriate testing: Ensuring communities understand the need and value of presenting for screening is the fundamental requirement for successfully achieving and maintaining elimination of COVID-19 community transmission. This has been demonstrated both in countries which have high testing levels and have not seen resurgence despite lifting of containment measure, 36 and in those countries that successful controlled transmission through containment, but are seeing resurgence of community transmission due to limited testing. 37 The fever and cough surveillance strategy provides the opportunity for simple and clear messaging to the community: isolate and get tested if you have fever and cough. In other settings, provision of paid sick leave for those with fever and cough supports compliance of testing and home isolation.1 Strategies for effective community engagement from other pandemics also provide guidance in this regard.7,14 Also of great relevance is the response of the Australian community to date, which has demonstrated a high uptake of highly burdensome containment measures. 4 The community has also demonstrated a high uptake of testing each time testing criteria have been expanded.38 It is reasonable therefore to expect, that with a consistent and coordinated community engagement strategy and interventions that support timely and easy access to testing, uptake will be high.\n"," Reliance on hospital cases to signal transmission has lower sensitivity, with sensitivity decreasing as the reproductive number increases. It also has other disadvantages. Overall, the proportion of symptomatic cases hospitalised with COVID-19 is 20% globally,21 and the true proportion is likely to be lower if asymptomatic cases are included. A focus of increased hygiene, social distancing and containment measures has been on protecting those at most risk of severe disease and hospitalisation such as the elderly, immunocompromised or those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular disease.39,40 If such measures successfully protect vulnerable populations, we would expect to see a substantial decrease in the proportion of cases with severe disease, and therefore the proportion hospitalised. This would further diminish the value of hospitalised disease as an indicator of transmission, as such cases may occur even later or not at all in many transmission chains.\n"," Random testing of sentinel asymptomatic groups is inefficient at most levels of likely prevalence. The level of testing required to be confident of reliably detecting all transmission chains in the community, or obtaining precise estimates useful for policy making, is unlikely to be feasible on an ongoing basis in most settings. As Table 2 demonstrates, at a range of COVID-19 prevalence, and even with very high levels of testing, the majority of cases in the population are missed, and the estimates of prevalence have a comparatively wide range of uncertainly around them. It should also be noted that these results are for cross-sectional testing in the sentinel population, and would need to be repeated on an ongoing basis to constitute an effective surveillance system, entailing a high level of frequent, repeated and large-scale testing. Even if testing capacity were increased to the level at which the entire asymptomatic population could be screened, this could not be feasibly undertaken in a narrow time window. As a result, if there is undetected transmission, there is the potential for disease to move from those not tested to those previously tested negative over the time period in which the screening was underway.\n"," .

Currently, a proportion of all cases identified in Australia are classified as 'unknown' source of exposure.5 As Figure  2 demonstrates, this by definition means their source of exposure is likely to have initiated multiple chains of transmission by the time the downstream case is identified. Widespread testing of all contacts, upstream and downstream, including low risk contacts around such cases, and even geographical/fomite related testing of possible sources of infection is the most effective strategy for filling the gaps in transmission mapping indicated by such cases, and therefore ensuring identification and management of such unrecognised community transmission.\n"," Pooling is efficient, as it considerably increases the coverage of testing. Even if pooling results in a decrease in sensitivity of pooled tests, the overall number of cases in the population missed due to a higher number of false negatives is small compared to the number that would be missed due to not being tested when pooling is not applied. As Table 3 demonstrates, this is the case even if sensitivity following pooling were to drop to 70%, at COVID-19 prevalence ranging from 0.05%-3.If pooled testing is applied in low-prevalence settings with the expectation that sensitivity will be lower, messaging to the public must indicate that some cases may be missed, and that those with symptoms should isolate regardless of test results Table 4 demonstrates, at low prevalence, small changes in specificity result in large changes in the positive predictive value, and therefore most positive tests are false positives. At higher prevalence, the proportion of positive tests that are false positives decrease. Although specificity is considered high (100%) for PCR tests, the gold standard, the impact of reduced specificity is an important consideration when assessing rapid diagnostic tests coming to market. It may be that a contributor to the very high levels of asymptomatic disease reported in some settings may be partly due to lower test specificity, and this should be investigated further.\n"," Expanded testing capacity, low prevalence: Ideally, under these conditions we would expand the case definition for screening. Inclusion of symptoms emerging as useful predictors of early and/or mild disease (e.g. anosmia and loss of taste)33 may increase the sensitivity of the system and allow earlier detection of transmission chains, especially once containment is lifted and the reproductive number for any new cases increases accordingly.\n"," The determining factor in regards to the number of individuals requiring testing is the prevalence of screening case definition symptoms in the general community. As Table 1 demonstrates, this means that at the peak of the influenza season, the testing requirements will increase between three to six fold compared to the non-influenza season. In Australia, peak influenza transmission occurs from late May-early July. In addition, if COVID-19 has a seasonal pattern, and this is likely to be the case considering other respiratory pathogens and similar SARS-CoV viruses,41 any residual transmission that continues into these months is likely to be amplified by seasonal effects. This suggests that given a strategy of strong containment and exhaustive surveillance aimed at elimination of COVID-19 community transmission, investing as much as possible in achieving this before the peak of the influenza season will optimise the value of every investment made in testing, contact tracing and containment.\n"," It is important to note that our study only assessed surveillance and related measures for control of local transmission. One of the main contributors to transmission in Australia, and an important factor in effective control, has been how Australia's borders, both air and sea, have been managed. Hotel quarantining of new international arrivals began on March 28th, 42 and appears to have contributed to the marked reduction in locally acquired disease, although disaggregation of data over time in relation to place of acquisition is not .

An enhanced surveillance system that has achieved elimination of detectable disease from the community is designed to detect and manage early re-introductions or emergence, including travel-related disease. However, continuation of effective border controls once other social distancing and control measures are lifted will reduce the pressure on the surveillance system to identify and manage imported disease and related local transmission once elimination has been achieved and while maintaining a relatively normal return to life within Australia.\n"," The other major challenge to the surveillance system will come from superspreading events. Both during this outbreak and in past, significant outbreaks of other infectious diseases, such events centre around religious or burial activities,43 other large gatherings where contact occurs, and around health facilities and other institutional settings.44 Limiting the size and opportunities for transmission in such settings that are non-essential will be an important part of control. However, health facilities are essential services, and must continue functioning. Measures for heightened general infection prevention and control that cover both staff and patients, and deal not only with disinfection, but with patient and staff flow and which are linked to intensive surveillance, are a critical aspect of ongoing COVID-19 management in such settings even once elimination has been achieved. Such measures can and should also be applied to essential services and settings where there is a high proportion of vulnerable individuals (e.g. aged care), in the latter case not to prevent superspreading events, but to protect those most vulnerable to severe disease.\n"," Australia currently has observed community transmission of COVID-19 in some jurisdictions, while in others, most cases are in or linked to returned travellers. Measures implemented at the end of March 2020 include isolation of cases, border controls, quarantine of contacts and social distancing. These measures have been escalated in some jurisdictions to include closure of schools, universities and non-essential workplaces.29-34 Testing rates are relatively high by international standards,35 and COVID-19 surveillance in some jurisdictions in Australia has moved beyond just testing of high-risk populations (e.g. symptomatic returned travellers and contacts of cases) to inclusion of testing of individuals likely to reflect communitybased transmission (e.g. symptomatic health care workers and patients with pneumonia), and testing of fever and cough as proposed in this paper.45 This provides a foundation on which to bring about greater current pandemic control, as well as a means of detecting early resurgence in the community following successful control.\n"," Given our findings, we recommend exhaustive testing of patients presenting with fever and cough in primary care as the most efficient and feasible means of detecting all community transmission of COVID-19 in high and low transmission settings. This is in addition to current testing regimens such as the testing of symptomatic travellers, contacts, health care workers and hospitalised pneumonia cases. Once community cases are identified, detailed and meticulous upstream and downstream contact tracing, linked to quarantining of all contacts, and both antigen and serological testing of all upstream contacts who may be the source of infection, will support elimination of community transmission, and rapid control if and when reintroductions of disease occur. This strategy optimises the likelihood of remaining in the elimination phase while allowing for ongoing lifting of containment measures. Community engagement in order to ensure high levels of testing uptake and compliance with follow up measures in identified cases and their contacts is critical to successful implementation of this strategy.\n"," .

However, it is frequently challenging to estimate the effectiveness of prevention measures [6, 7] . Key barriers include the fact that there is generally a low incidence of infections in any one hospital, and therefore individual facilities have little opportunity to quantify the impact of an intervention in a short study. Multicenter studies have been conducted to help address this issue, but their cost can be prohibitive and the length of follow-up can be relatively short [8, 9] . Further complicating the problem, patients transfer between hospitals, nursing homes, other healthcare settings, and the broader community; thus, transmission and symptom onset in non-hospital settings can complicate efforts to evaluate the impacts of hospital-based interventions [7, [10] [11] [12] .\n"," To address such challenges, investigators sometimes use simulations to help assess whether a previous intervention was effective or whether a new intervention is likely to be successful [13, 14] . Transmission models are relatively inexpensive and quick to create, but require additional assumptions compared to traditional epidemiologic approaches (e.g., randomized trials, cohort studies) [15, 16] . Concerningly, even seemingly innocuous assumptions that are introduced to simplify an analysis have the potential to alter results in ways that modelers did not expect. For instance, modelers often simulate asymptomatically colonized individuals as having higher rates of hospital admission [17, 18] or longer lengths of hospital stay [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] compared to uncolonized individuals because they are asymptomatically colonized. While it is true that colonized individuals on average spend more time in hospitals per admission and are more readily admitted, there are likely several confounding factors that can explain the association [36] . For example, people asymptomatically colonized with an HAI causing pathogen tend to be older and sicker than non-carriers [37] . Consequently, a more plausible explanation is that people in poor health are more likely to be hospitalized and to have long lengths of stay, and thereby are more likely to become colonized with a HAI causing pathogen. Reverse causation can also explain some of the crude association between carriage status and length of stay [38] . As a result, transmission models could provide inaccurate estimates of intervention impact when asymptomatic carriage is simulated in these ways. Therefore, our primary aim was to test whether the assumptions regarding higher rates of hospital admission or longer lengths of hospital stay for asymptomatic carriers can affect the results of simulations that evaluate the effects of interventions that work by preventing transmission of HAIs interventions.\n"," We created a deterministic compartmental model with Uncolonized, Colonized (asymptomatic carriers), and Symptomatic disease states to simulate transmission of an HAI pathogen in a hospital and the surrounding community (Fig 1) . For each state, we included separate compartments for each combination of location (hospital or community), carrier type (short or long durations of carriage), and risk group. In our examples, we used two age groups (persons aged 0 to 64 years and adults 65 or older) to define the risk groups since older age is generally recognized as a proxy for increased rates of hospitalization and longer lengths of stay, and agespecific hospitalization data are widely available (Table 1 ) [39] . We parameterized the model so that adults 65 or older spent more time in the hospital than persons aged 0 to 64 years because of their higher admission rates and longer lengths of stay (Table 2 ). Individuals could move between the hospital and community but, to simplify the model, they could not transition between age groups or carrier types. We parameterized the model using data for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, Table 2 , [29, 40] ). Short-term and long-term carrier types were based on the observed heterogeneity in carriage duration for S. aureus [41, 42] .\n"," Transmission could occur between patients in the hospital or between individuals in the community, and the infectiousness of those carrying the pathogen was allowed to differ between the hospital (β 1 ) and community (β 2 ). Colonized and symptomatic individuals in the same location were assumed to be equally infectious (i.e., had the same β 1 or β 2 values). However, contact rates could be assortative by age group, meaning individuals of one age group were more likely to contact members of the same age group than expected if contacts had occurred randomly. The degree of this assortativity could vary by location (δ 1 , δ 2 ). Transmission from adults aged 65 or older in the community was reduced by a proportion (σ) to reflect the fewer overall number of social contacts of older adults compared to younger people [43] . Once colonized, individuals could become symptomatic at a rate α, and this rate could depend on age group and location. Asymptomatic carriers could clear colonization at rate γ a for shortterm carriers, or γ b for long-term carriers. Symptomatic cases returned to the colonized state when they recovered from infection at rate γ S . diagram of the model with compartments for each combination of (i) Uncolonized (U), Colonized (C), or Symptomatic (S); (ii) persons aged 0 to 64 years or adults 65 or older; (iii) shortterm or long-term carrier types; and (iv) subscript denoting location in a hospital (1) or community (2) . Gray arrows show movement between the hospital and community, through admission and discharge, whereas black arrows show transmission, disease progression, recovery from disease, and loss of carriage. Solid and dashed borderlines denote compartments for each age strata, and gray shading denotes the long-term carrier compartments. Individuals could not move between age groups or carrier types. Full model equations are in S1 Appendix. Admission (a) and discharge (r) rates could depend on age group and whether the person was uncolonized, colonized, or symptomatic. Admissions and discharges were balanced to keep hospital and community sizes constant. The lengths of stay in the hospital and rates of admission for colonized, symptomatic, or adults aged 65 or older could be equal to or higher than the rate of admission of uncolonized, persons aged 0 to 64 years according to the following admission rate multipliers: adults aged 65 or older (ρ >65 ), colonized (ρ C ), or symptomatic (ρ S ). These multipliers interacted multiplicatively for individuals with more than one risk \n"," factor for admission (e.g., adults aged 65 or older who were colonized were admitted at a rate ρ >65 � ρ C times that of uncolonized, persons aged 0 to 64 years). We modeled two types of hospital interventions: one that decreased the infectiousness of carriers (hereafter termed \"transmission-based intervention\") and another that increased the rate at which asymptomatic carriers cleared carriage (hereafter termed \"decolonization\"). These interventions can be thought of as simplifications of hand hygiene or use of barrier precautions (transmission-based interventions) and the use of antiseptic bathing and nasal decolonization (decolonization). To simulate the transmission-based intervention, the parameter θ proportionally reduced the infectiousness of asymptomatically colonized and symptomatic carriers in the hospital. The parameters γ int,0-64 and γ int,>65 represented the additional clearance rates due to hospital-based decolonization intervention. We assumed that the duration of symptoms would not be affected by the decolonization intervention.\n"," We used this general model to test the effects of different assumptions regarding asymptomatic carrier admission rates and lengths of stay on estimates of intervention impact. To help a. Transmissibility parameters were fitted using the least-squares method to obtain 3.4% prevalence in the hospital [29] and 1.5% prevalence in the community [40] for each model in the absence of any intervention. b. To calculate the age-assortativity of patient contacts in the hospital using empirical data, we assumed that most transmission is within wards, and that children 0 to 17 years old and women giving birth would not mix with the adults aged 65 years and older. Using these assumptions, age-stratified national data on the total annual number of patient days from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) 2012 [39] and childbirth stay data from [50] , we estimated that 40% of contacts that adults aged 65 years and older have in the hospital would be with persons aged 0 to 64 years old, whereas this fraction would be 61% if contacts occurred randomly between age groups. We adjusted δ 1 until the percentage of contacts within and between age groups in the hospital matched our estimates.\n"," c. Using symmetric contact matrices and all of the European survey data from POLYMOD [48] , we calculated the proportion of individuals in each age group and the fraction of contacts within and between age groups. We adjusted δ 2 so that the percentage of contacts by age group matched the POLYMOD data.\n"," d. We adjusted discharge rates for the Age Group model so that the mean length of stay was kept at 4.5 days in line with the other models. For example, we used adults aged 65 years and older length of stay and total number of stays for from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) 2012 data [39] . 34.8% of discharges in HCUP were in the adults aged 65 years and older age group and this group had a mean LOS of 5.2 days. Therefore, we calculated that the persons aged 0 to 64 years old group must have a mean LOS of 4.13 days to produce an overall reported mean LOS of 4.5 days across both age groups.\n"," e. In the Colonized LOS and Colonized Admission + LOS models, we assumed that the length of stay for asymptomatically colonized individuals was 1 day longer than that of uncolonized individuals. The length of stay for uncolonized individuals was adjusted to maintain a mean length of stay across all patients of 4.5 days.\n"," f. We balanced the total number of admissions and discharges in order to keep the number of hospital patients constant. To do this, we calculated the persons aged 0 to 64 years old's admission rate by dividing the number of daily hospital discharges by the community census, where the community census was the sum of all people in the community weighted by the values of the admission rate multipliers for adults aged 65 years and older, asymptomatic carriers, or symptomatic individuals relative to uncolonized persons 0 to 64 years old (ρ >65 , ρ C , and ρ S respectively). We then multiplied the admission rate for uncolonized persons 0 to 64 years old by the relevant admission rate multipliers to calculate the admission rates for the other groups. g. After setting the length of stays for the Age Group model, ρ >65 was increased until the percentage of admissions that were adults aged 65 years and older in the simulations matched the estimate from national data of 34.8% of admissions being adults aged 65 years and older [39] .\n"," h. For example, an effectiveness value of 30% is consistent with a combined coverage of 50% and efficacy of 60% or coverage of 75% and efficacy of 40%.\n"," https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264344.t002\n"," motivate the problem, we can consider the following hypothetical scenario. Suppose there are limited data suggesting a particular HAI intervention has been effective during outbreaks, but it has not been studied in endemic settings. Consequently, researchers want to assess the possible impact of the intervention in hospitals where the pathogen is endemic in order to inform decisions about the likely generalizability of empirical results. Ideally, the simulation should meet some basic criteria in order for the example to be plausible (e.g., the simulated prevalence of the pathogen in the hospital and community should match data from well-designed, largescale screening studies). However, there are many different ways to make the simulation fit the observed data, and certain approaches could potentially skew results. Of particular concern are common modeling assumptions that asymptomatic carriers have higher rates of hospital admission or longer lengths of stay precisely because they are asymptomatically colonized, which have no biological basis. We analyzed a set of models to help inform modeling decisions in such a scenario. We first devised parameter values to create five sub-models for comparison ( Table 2 ). (1) Age Group model: we stratified the population into two age strata: persons 0 to 64 years old and adults aged 65 years and older, where older individuals had higher admission rates and longer lengths of stay in the hospital. No other model stratified the population into age groups. In the next three models, asymptomatically colonized individuals had (2) higher admission rates (Colonized Admission model), (3) longer length of stays (Colonized LOS model), or (4) both higher admission rates and longer lengths of stays (Colonized Admission + LOS model) compared to uncolonized individuals. We used the Age Group model as our base model against which we compared other model variants. Our main focus was on comparing Models 1-4. We also included a fifth model because of its widespread use (5) Homogeneous Carriage model: we assumed there were no differences in the average duration of carriage across the population. The average duration of carriage for the Homogeneous Carriage model was calculated as a weighted average of the mean durations of colonization used in the other models.\n"," For each model, we fitted the hospital and community transmissibility parameters using the least-squares method to obtain 3.4% MRSA prevalence in the hospital and 1.5% prevalence in the community in the absence of interventions. Then, we ran the model to equilibrium and introduced either the transmission-based intervention, decolonization, or both. For each model, we compared the reproduction numbers (R) and percent of symptomatic cases averted by the interventions. We calculated the number of symptomatic cases averted by subtracting the number of symptomatic cases in a specific model with an intervention from the number of symptomatic cases for the same model without an intervention.\n"," A reproduction number (R) quantifies the spread of a pathogen in a population. We used the next-generation matrix method to calculate R [51] , though we note that the reproduction numbers provided here do not have a standard R 0 interpretation [52] . In addition to an overall R, we also calculated reproduction numbers that included only hospital transmission (R hosp ) by setting community transmission to zero (i.e., β 2 = 0). We similarly calculated a community reproduction number (R comm ) for each model. Separate reproduction numbers for hospital and community transmission are commonly reported in the literature [12, [53] [54] [55] and help compare transmission dynamics in each setting.\n"," We also examined the effects of assumptions about colonized length of stay (r C ) and colonized admission rate (ρ C ) by manipulating the parameter ranges within a single model structure (Age group model). We divided each of the two multiplier parameters into ranges of values from 1 to 3, and then created combinations of each parameter value. For every combination of the two parameters, we used least squares to fit the hospital (β 1 ) and community (β 2 ) transmission rates to obtain 3.4% prevalence in the hospital [29] and 1.5% prevalence in the community [40] for each model in the absence of any intervention.\n"," We then applied a transmission-based or decolonization intervention and calculated the number of symptomatic cases averted by each intervention. For each set of parameter values, we compared the number of cases averted to a base case when the multipliers were set to one (r C = ρ C = 1). This base case either represented the Age group model or the Homogeneous model; in both models, asymptomatic carriers have the same admission rate and length of stay as uncolonized individuals of the same age. We calculated the percent change in cases averted as the percentage of cases averted with multipliers equal to 1 minus the percentage of cases averted with multipliers equal to \"x\", scaled by the percentage of cases averted with multipliers equal to 1. We visualized the results with a contoured heatmap and assessed differences across assumptions and treatments.\n"," We used R (version 3.5.0) to create and analyze the model [56] .\n"," In the pre-intervention period, the equilibrium prevalence of MRSA was 3.4% in the hospital and 1.5% in the community across all five models ( Table 3 ). The admission prevalence was approximately 1.5% for the Age Group, Homogeneous, and Colonized LOS models, whereas admission prevalence was 1.96% for both models that assumed that colonized individuals were more likely to be admitted to the hospital than uncolonized individuals (i.e., Colonized Admission, Colonized Admission + LOS). The rate of carriage acquisition in the hospital ranged from 2.33/1,000 uncolonized patient-days (Colonized Admission + LOS model) to 4.79/1,000 uncolonized patient-days (Age Group model). As expected, the Homogeneous model had the lowest R (1.021), while R was 1.046 for all other models ( Table 3 ). The effect of the different model assumptions on the estimated impact of a hospital intervention depended on the type of intervention (Fig 2, Table 3 ). In the absence of any interventions, 8,223 cases occurred over 5 years in each model. For the transmission-based intervention, the percentage of symptomatic cases averted was highest for the Homogeneous Model, followed by the following models in order: Age Group, Colonized Admission, Colonized LOS, and Colonized Admission + LOS. (Fig 2A) . The differences in intervention impact between the models occurred across a wide range of transmission-based intervention effectiveness values (Fig 2) .\n"," For the decolonization intervention, the percent of symptomatic cases averted was again largest for the Homogeneous Carriage model, but was similar across the other models until the rate of decolonization became high (Fig 2B, Table 3 ). Results for scenarios where both interventions were applied concomitantly were in line with findings for each intervention applied separately (S1 Fig). \n"," All else being equal, including assumptions where asymptomatically colonized individuals had increased length of stay or admission rates because of their colonization status heavily affected estimates of the impact of a transmission-based intervention but had modest effects for a decolonization intervention (Fig 3) . Both multipliers had similarly strong effects for the transmission-based intervention. However, the length of stay multiplier (r C ) had a stronger relative impact than the admission rate multiplier for the decolonization intervention. Higher values of length of stay multiplier or colonized admission rates generally led to greater differences in the number of cases averted. However, when using the homogeneous model as the baseline case, results were more consistent across treatment types (S2 Fig). \n"," We showed that assuming asymptomatic carriers have higher rates of hospital admission or longer lengths of stay can bias simulations of the impact of hospital-based HAI interventions designed to prevent spread of healthcare-associated pathogens, especially for transmissionbased interventions (e.g., enhanced infection control efforts). These assumptions are typically included as if asymptomatic carriers had more healthcare exposure precisely because they were asymptomatically colonized [17] [18] [19] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . However, confounding and reverse causation are more likely explanations for observed differences in admission rates and lengths of stay [36] .\n"," In our main example (Fig 2) , the carrier assumptions produced larger differences across models in the impact of a transmission-based intervention than for a decolonization a. The parameters used in these simulations are listed in the models' respective columns in Table 2 . b. Percent of colonized patients decolonized before discharge is the probability that a colonized individual in the hospital reverted to being uncolonized before being discharged because of the decolonization intervention. For the Age Group model, the discharge rate was weighted by the relative proportions of persons aged 0 to 64 years old and adults aged 65 years and older in the hospital. c. We combined hospital and community cases in calculations of the percent of symptomatic cases averted.\n"," https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264344.t003 Table 2 for parameter values used for each model. The percent change in number of symptomatic cases averted in the Age Group Model when increasing the colonized admission rate multiplier (ρ C ) and/or the colonized length of stay multiplier (r C ) compared to the base case (i.e., r C = ρ C = 1). Colors and contour lines denote the percentage change in cases averted compared to the base case. For each combination of values for the r C and ρ C multipliers, the transmission parameters were refit to achieve an equilibrium prevalence of 3.4% colonized individuals in the hospital and 1.5% in the community. We ran models to equilibrium and then implemented a decolonization intervention (γ int = 0.035) or a transmission-based intervention (θ = 30%).\n"," https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264344.g003\n"," intervention. Compared to the Age Group model, fewer cases were predicted to be averted by a transmission-based intervention for models where colonized individuals had longer lengths of stay or higher admission rates. The most likely explanation is that when we assumed higher admission rates or longer lengths of stay for colonized individuals, then hospital transmissibility did not need to be as high to reach the same equilibrium hospital prevalence compared to the Age Group model, and therefore the community became relatively more important for pathogen transmission. In other words, the transmission-based intervention, which proportionally reduced transmissibility in the hospital (β 1 ), prevented fewer transmissions in the Colonized Admission, Colonized LOS, and Colonized Admission + LOS models than in the Age Group model because the latter had the highest value of β 1 to begin with, the highest R hosp value, and therefore the largest contribution of hospital transmission to the overall R value. In contrast, assuming homogeneous lengths of carriage resulted in much higher numbers of transmissions and cases averted than in the Age Group model because the Homogeneous Carriage model had a lower R and transmission in the Homogeneous Carriage model was even more heavily weighted towards transmission in the hospital. On the other hand, decolonization treatments had smaller differences across models, possibly because the number of colonized individuals in the hospital was always the same so only a certain number could be decolonized. For combinations of decolonization and transmission-based interventions, comparisons across models could give similar results depending on the value of each intervention parameter (S1 Fig) .\n"," A potentially valid reason for parameterizing higher admission rates or longer lengths of stay for individuals in model compartments containing asymptomatic carriers is when symptomatic and colonized individuals are pooled together. In this case, the combined compartments could be parameterized using the weighted average of parameter values for colonized and symptomatic individuals [57] . However, such averaged parameter values would need to change in response to an intervention that affected the ratio of asymptomatic versus symptomatic carriers, and it could be difficult to calculate what the new ratio and parameter values should be without representing asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers separately. As with analyses that use standard statistical models (e.g., case-control studies analyzed with logistic regression), we recommend that the choice of which variables to include in a transmission model should be guided by the research question as well as subject matter considerations [58] .\n"," Additionally, we assessed the influence of these assumptions over a range of potential values. In general, the stronger the assumption about asymptomatically colonized individuals and their propensity to stay in the hospital, the more one might miscalculate the impact of an intervention. In our simulations, even small changes in the multipliers led to substantial differences in the model results. However, the type of intervention is still important: we observed different results for an intervention to reduce transmission compared to an intervention that decolonized patients, likely because decolonization acts more through recovery and transmissionbased interventions directly reduces transmissibility.\n"," Our analyses have several limitations. For example, we omitted antibiotics, competition from other pathogen strains (e.g methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or species (e.g. Clostridioides difficile), and impact of patient transfers to or from additional healthcare facilities healthcare facilities, each of which could have affected the magnitude of our results. However, we expect that the same issues would remain if such factors were included because assuming that asymptomatic carriers are more likely to be admitted to hospital or have longer lengths of stay would still have no biological basis and would continue to artificially inflate pathogen prevalence in the hospital compared to a more appropriately structured model (e.g., finer age stratification, higher admission rates for recently discharged patients or nursing home residents). We also expect similar problems to occur if pathogen incidence data were used for fitting instead of prevalence data. Lastly, including higher rates of hospitalization and longer lengths of stay for individuals recently discharged from hospital compared to those who have not been hospitalized recently would have improved the accuracy of the model. However, such model complexity was not required to illustrate the problem, and therefore doing so would have made our example more difficult without clearly providing a commensurate benefit. In future work, it could be useful to include such additional complexity and assess how well different models can simultaneously fit contemporaneous estimates of community prevalence, admission prevalence, hospital prevalence, and/or hospital incidence, which could also help discriminate between simulations in addition to using subject matter knowledge to guide modeling decisions.\n"," In our Age Group model, we stratified the population into groups of younger and older individuals, and each age group had different admission rates and lengths of stay. However, we do not expect that this would result in the same problems as including changes in admission rates and lengths of stay being a direct consequence of being an asymptomatic carrier. Age is a proxy for factors that more directly affect admission rates and lengths of stay (e.g., being diagnosed with a health condition, insurance status). Such factors are unlikely to change concurrently with the gain and loss of colonization, especially after having included additional states in the model (e.g., hospitalization, which is correlated with health status and the risk of acquiring a pathogen), and there are no interventions that affect date of birth. Therefore, we believe that the Age Group model is more realistic compared to the other models and it was useful as a simple base case against which to compare the other modeling assumptions. Building on this framework, additional risk groups could be considered for inclusion as necessary. For example, male gender, recent hospitalization, and residence in a nursing home are risk factors for S. aureus colonization and bacteremia due to an S. aureus infection [59] [60] [61] [62] , and each could be considered for inclusion as additional risk groups.\n"," A simple model cannot capture every possible factor, but our simplified model helped illustrate the central problem associated with attributing different admission rates or lengths of stay to asymptomatic carriers without a clear biological basis for doing so. Our results show that such assumptions can greatly affect estimates of the impact of interventions, and therefore should be justified. We have included our model code, which can be adapted to represent other HAI pathogens and risk groups by changing parameter values or adapting the model structure. While the pathogen parameters in our main example were based on MRSA, our conclusions are broadly applicable because assuming that asymptomatic carriers are more likely to be admitted to hospital or have longer lengths of stay generally have no biological basis.\n"," It is important to assess how modeling assumptions influence estimates of intervention impact. We have shown that common assumptions regarding how colonized individuals are included in simulations can heavily bias estimates of the impact of transmission interruption and to a lesser extent decolonization interventions. Modelers ought to consider whether data in favor of such assumptions could also be biased, how including such assumptions can affect model results, and if a more complex model (e.g., that includes �1 risk factor) is necessary to address specific research aims. Decision-makers should also critically evaluate the biological assumptions underpinning parameter values used in models that inform policy. \n","Score: 3.4759907266387025\n","\n","Title: The contribution of stigma to the transmission and treatment of tuberculosis in a hyperendemic indigenous population in Brazil\n","Body Text: these territories is almost exclusively of Guarani-Kaiowá ethnicity.

Mindful of close Guarani-Kaiowá family structures, we did not insist on strictly individual interviews if the participant wanted to be interviewed with family members present. Adult members of TB patients' households present at the interview were invited to participate (TB Patient Relatives, TBRs), and were interviewed using the same interview guide as the CMs. CMs were selected by snowball sampling and matched by gender and indigenous territory of residence. The semi-structured interviews took place in the home of the interview participant and were conducted in Guarani or Portuguese depending on the interviewee's preference. For interviews conducted in Guarani, LP, AB, or a research assistant would ask the questions and act as simultaneous interpreter to IVK. Respecting traditional gender divisions, the researchers IVK, LP, and AB were accompanied by gender-specific research assistants. All interviews were audio-recorded. Data saturation was reached when no new comments were appearing in the interviews, as described by Fusch & Ness [18] .\n"," Audio-recorded data, transcribed and translated from Guarani to Portuguese (where necessary) by the research assistants under the supervision of LP and AB, were analyzed using framework analysis. After an initial review of the interviews and field notes by all authors, IVK, IMC, and PCB separately coded passages of interest in the interviews. IVK drafted the first thematic framework which was compared with the coding of IMC and PCB. We generally highlighted the same passages but discussed the coding labels relating to the sources/actors in anticipated stigma until consensus was reached. The draft framework was then discussed with the JIGA group to minimize bias by balancing views from inside and outside the community. Using the finalized thematic framework, IVK undertook the coding using NVivo (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia) software and drafted the first analysis of the passages for each theme for revision by the other authors (S3 Appendix). Citations from the interviews in this text were translated from Portuguese to English by IVK and revised by the other authors.\n"," Throughout the text findings are presented according to the following scale of representation of interviewees: few, <20%; some, 20-40%; many, 40-60%; most,60-80%; nearly all, 80-100%.\n"," This study is part of the project \"Social Inequalities and Tuberculosis: Transmission Dynamics, Living Conditions and Interfaces between Biomedicine and Traditional Indigenous Medicine\", approved by the Research Ethics Committees at the National School of Public Health at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) (#15988913.9.0000.5240/354.060), and the Ministry of Health (#15988913.9.0000.5240/650.820). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants who did not speak Portuguese would have the consent form orally translated and explained in Guarani. Participants unable to read and write would have the form read to them by a relative or one of the Guarani-Kaiowá research assistants and sign with a fingerprint. No honorarium was offered for the interview.\n"," The interviews were carried out in June 2016. Data were saturated with 53 interviews, with a mean length of 54 minutes. Four male CMs from the Guassuty indigenous territory declined to interview as they were on their way to another location. In five households of TB patients, other family members were at home but did not come out to meet us. We interviewed 19 TBCs, 11 TBRs (from 11 different households), and 23 CMs, Table 1 . It was our experience that the presence of family members made for richer interviews as participants felt more at ease talking to us. No stigmatization within the household was reported in households where both a TBC and a TBR were interviewed.\n"," We present qualitative findings according to the standardized TB stigma categories developed by the Challenge TB Stigma Measurement Guidance [19] : a) community/public stigma; negative attitudes to TB in the community, b) anticipated stigma; the expectation and/or fear of being stigmatized, adopting behavioral changes, c) experienced/enacted stigma; concrete experiences of exclusion/discrimination, seen either from the viewpoint of the stigmatized (experienced stigma) or the stigmatizer (enacted stigma), d) internalized or self-stigma; changes in self-perception, loss of self-esteem and/or feelings of guilt or shame as the individual has come to adopt negative stereotypes, and e) secondary stigma; stigmatization by association with a TB patient. Relatives (TBRs) 6 5 11 Community members (CMs) 11 12 23 Perceptions of TB transmission Further, many participants reported that living in dirty, dusty, and/or bug-infested environments increased the risk of TB; ''Many of our women do not take care of their houses. They leave everything dirty-they do not clean around the house. TB comes more quickly when things are dirty\" (CM8). Contact with dirty hands or with contaminated utensils such as spoons, plates, and cups was believed by many CMs to cause TB: ''This disease is really infectious. It spreads via spoons\" (CM9). Few TBCs and TBRs expressed this view. Some participants referred to the working conditions on the sugarcane plantations which involve exposure to dust and ashes: ''I worked on the sugarcane plantation, burning the cane [to facilitate the harvest]. There were a lot of ashes and that stuck in my lungs\" (TBC10).\n"," Many participants expressed beliefs of TB transmission rooted in traditional Guarani-Kaiowá concepts of disease as an imbalance between body and soul, leaving an opening for evil spirits to bring in disease. Being afraid of the disease, or of contact with a TB patient, can be a weak spot through which the spirit of the disease can enter: ''If you look at the body of a person who died and had TB, and you are afraid, then the disease will come to you\" (CM4). Some participants reported that diseases or witchcraft may be in the air at certain times, during which it is recommended to stay indoors to avoid TB: 'My daughter told me ''be careful when you go outside because the diseases are around right now\"\"(TBC2).\n"," A few participants saw TB as a result of accidents or violence where the disease enters the body through injuries: ''Her ex-husband gave it [TB] to her. He raped her and put a bottle up her vagina and left her for dead. He put the disease inside her\" (TBR2).\n"," Most CMs expressed views that a TB patient must be socially isolated while on treatment, with many believing that this isolation must include the entire household of the TB patient. ''When one has TB, obviously everybody in that house should be treated and keep a distance so they do not spread it to others\"(CM9). Most CMs stressed that a person with TB contaminates cutlery and plates; ''If I have TB and I eat, and somebody else eats from that plate, then he already gets it (CM16). Many CMs thought that the isolation could be lifted when the infected person had completed treatment.\n"," Describing how people with TB symptoms would delay seeking treatment, many CMs condemned them for putting others at risk: ''They go to the doctor only after somebody looks at that person and sees that he or she is very thin and asks if they feel any pain, and even then they will say no. I think it is lack of respect, because that person must know that the disease is attacking him or her\" (CM12). Many CMs also perceived people with tuberculosis as unable or unwilling to take care of themselves, thus letting the disease progress and subsequently transmitting it to others: ''It is not like I want to abandon my friend if he has TB, but there is also a part where you need to make an effort and go to the doctor and take care of yourself, because that disease is passed on from one to another\" (CM20). This perceived lack of willingness to take control of the disease was stated as the reason for isolating oneself from people with TB, thus holding the patient accountable for infecting others; ''In the sugarcane plantations there is already a lot [of TB]. But it is here in the village that you get it because these people do not take care of themselves\" (CM9).\n"," Anticipating rejection, most TBCs related that they only told the nearest family and the community healthcare agent about their TB diagnosis; \"After I got TB, I did not leave the house anymore. That way no one would find out. Only the nurses knew about it\" (TBC18). Anticipating ostracization from the community, some TBCs related not going to the healthcare station for a consultation as they did not want to be seen receiving the directly observed treatment in front of their house every day.\n"," Most male TBCs, employed by the sugarcane plantations in the regions on fixed-term contracts when they felt the first symptoms, would try to hide their illness until the end of the contract, sometimes for several months, as they did not want to be sent home and lose the work: ''I was on the sugarcane plantation and I was feeling ill for a long time. I could work only a little before I could no longer breathe. For 6 months I worked like that. One day I had to sit down, and the foreman saw me. He took me to the hospital, and they told my wife that I had died\" (TBC18).\n"," Most TBCs related one or more concrete experiences of stigmatization. Where TB was discovered while the TBC was working on a sugarcane plantation, the response varied considerably by plantation. Some TBCs related being sent back to work after a superficial examination at the workplace, some were sent home, a few were taken to the healthcare service, and a yet another few reported receiving an examination by an external healthcare provider.\n"," While a few TBCs said that a worker could come back to work after having TB, some TBCs related personal difficulties with finding employment after having completed TB treatment as employers were uninterested in workers with a history of TB and could afford to turn them down as the supply of workers was much greater than the demand. ''After I was cured, I lived like this. The company did not want to hire me. Because I was very thin, they did not trust me. ''You will not be able to stand it\", they said\" (TBC11). Some participants reported that they were no longer able to perform the physically demanding manual labor after having had TB and had not returned to work.\n"," Being abandoned by the family was reported by a few TBCs: \"After I got this TB, they [exwife and children] no longer wanted to stay with me\" (TBC14). However, most TBCs experienced practical and emotional support from their immediate family members during treatment. This support was commonly seen as vital for the patient's recovery but also as carrying great personal risk of infection for the family members. Support was extended only to close family members and/or within the household: ''Only my daughter would come, and she would eat and drink tererê [iced yerba-mate drunk from a shared gourd] with me. She would also let the grandchildren drink tererê with me\" (TBC13). Some interviews with CMs corroborated that point: ''If a relative of mine has TB I will avoid them. If we do not live together, I do not know if he or she is doing the treatment\" (CM18). Experiences of avoidance and exclusion by family living in other households and by the community were not receiving visits, friends and family not allowing their children to visit, being the victim of gossip, and not being invited to share a tererê. One man described an episode of feeling rejected by his family living in another village: ''I went to my mother's house (. . .) even she did not want to drink tererê with me because she was afraid she would pass on the disease to my brothers\" (TBC16).\n"," Separating plates, mugs, and cutlery for TB patients is not part of the Brazilian tuberculosis control guidelines [20], but many TBCs described how staff from the healthcare service had handed out special utensils and recommended that the patient sleep and eat alone, thus unnecessarily contributing to the stigmatization of tuberculosis: ''they prohibited me from drinking tererê with friends who are in good health. I ate lunch alone. I had to have a separate plate, separate spoon, and my cup had to be separate\"(TBC2); ''They told me I had to wear a mask. I wore the mask at home. I did not want to leave the house wearing that\"(TBC12). Some CMs related how they had employed this infection control measure with relatives with TB; ''Yesterday we told her that we would not eat together with them (..) Just by using the same spoon the disease spreads, and if you or your spouse has it, it will pass on to others who do not have it\" (CM17). We described under perceptions of TB transmission that many CMs, but only few TBCs and TBRs, believed that TB is transmitted through contaminated/unclean cutlery and plates.\n"," Religious communities (traditional Guarani-Kaiowá prayer houses or evangelical churches) play a central role in the social life in the territories. For some TBCs, they offered a place of acceptance and support, based on the belief that faith would help cure the patient and prevent transmission to the congregation:\"They prayed for me. They were not afraid. It [TB] will not even be passed on, they said\"(TBC3). However, some TBCs experienced exclusion from their religious community: ''After she got TB, she stopped singing in the house of prayers. They were afraid it would spread to the others\"(CM1).\n"," As in the CM interviews, many TBCs reported that the stigmatization commonly lasted only until the completion of treatment after which social relations resumed. However, a few TBCs related that TB-associated stigma persisted even after the completion of treatment: \"Some people are afraid of me and when I arrive, they will not drink tererê with me. I know they know I had TB and they are afraid of getting it. It is still like this [a year after]\"(TBC11).\n"," Many TBCs described how the negative feelings from experienced and anticipated stigmatization in the form of rejection from family members and isolation and estrangement from the community were internalized, affecting their self-worth: ''When I went to work in the sugarcane plantation, I was not thin, I worked hard. When I see my brothers strong like that, and I am not, I feel strange. I sit here, I do not work, and I feel wrong. All my brothers go to work and I want to go. I cannot work anymore; I am no longer able to [get] work after I had TB\" (TBC11). For some TBCs, these negative emotions of rejection and isolation led to suicidal thoughts: ''My whole family was afraid of me and it made me feel rejected. I am afraid of visiting people. When I arrive, sometimes I feel that they will talk about me; ''Look who came, she has TB, we do not want to drink tererê with her\". It is so difficult to see even your mother be afraid of you. It makes you think it would be better if you died\"(TBC12).\n"," Stigmatization of TB also included members of the patient's household. Some TBRs described how they would not talk to others about the diagnosis as they anticipated rejection. These participants also related experienced stigma, where nobody wanted to touch them or be near them, and where they would be looked at from a distance: ''After he got TB, I also stopped going to church. People did not like that I was there\"(TBR11). Receiving prophylactic latent TB treatment also carried stigmatization for TBRs; ''They think I have the disease already, and they started to distance themselves from me and talk about me that I have TB even if I do not have it\" (TBR7).\n"," Summing up the points made in the interviews, this statement from a CM acknowledges that community/public stigmatization is 'damaging' to the TB patient and his/her family. Anticipating stigmatization, and knowing that his/her family will be the victims of secondary stigma, TB patients delay seeking treatment: ''It is only when the disease is very advanced that they will say something. Because when a person gets treatment, their whole house needs to get treatment. When you say that you feel pain, you are damaging your entire family\" (CM17).\n"," We conducted a study to explore TB-associated stigma and its impact on patients and their relatives in a Brazilian indigenous population with hyperendemic transmission of TB. We found that stigma impacts the lives of Guarani-Kaiowá TB patients and their relatives to a considerable degree, and that stigmatization represents an important barrier to treatment in this population. Patients, relatives, and community members alike held beliefs that disease is caused by a weakening of the body and spirit. The poor living conditions of the Guarani-Kaiowá were reflected in the numerous mentions of malnutrition as a risk factor.\n"," Significant community/public stigma surrounds TB in this population, associating TB with negative behavior such as being unclean/contaminated, abusing alcohol and drugs, and/or unable to provide for oneself, leaving TB patients and their families as undesirables in the community. With an unclear understanding of the mechanism of TB transmission, some community members held TB patients personally responsible for spreading the disease in the community. Remarkably similar descriptions of anticipated and community/public stigma show that TB-associated stigma is well known in the community. The question of blame illustrates the relevance of anticipated stigma as a separate category in unpacking TB stigmatization.\n"," Misguided recommendations from the local healthcare service to separate plates and utensils for TB patients contributed to the community/public and experienced/enacted stigmatization of TB. That a TB patient is no longer contagious after a few weeks of treatment was not discussed in any of the interviews, perhaps pointing to another gap in knowledge.\n"," There is limited evidence on the effect of interventions reducing TB stigma [21] . While awareness campaigns are necessary, some studies note that they may contribute to the stigmatization of TB and are not sufficient in themselves to combat TB stigma [22, 23] . Language used in awareness campaigns for airborne infectious diseases tends to stigmatize patients as a risk to the community [24, 25] . Our findings point to a need for raising awareness of TB transmission dynamics in the community and among healthcare service staff as a first step towards reducing TB stigma. As most interview participants in this population did not use a biomedical model to explain disease, an awareness campaign must be sensitive to traditional views of disease transmission. Using an approach that integrates biomedical principles of TB infection and transmission with traditional concepts of disease and health has been successful in other settings [26] [27] [28] .\n"," The sugarcane plantations employing Guarani-Kaiowá men have been identified as likely TB transmission hotspots [13] . Anticipated stigma led to significant delays in seeking treatment for Guarani-Kaiowá plantation workers as they feared losing their jobs. Delaying treatment for several months increases the likelihood of the worker infecting others, and suffering permanent lung damage, affecting future employment. Interventions are urgently needed to facilitate the return to employment for workers after TB treatment. Examples could be adult learning programs, skill upgrading, government involvement in regulations and enforcement of working conditions. Inequalities including limited access to education, land, and subsequently employment opportunities, are the origin of TB transmission in these communities and are part of the discrimination and violation of the human rights of the Guarani-Kaiowá [29] .\n"," Our findings suggest that the Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) scheme may inadvertently cause anticipated, experienced/enacted, and secondary stigma for patients and their relatives as the healthcare worker visits to the patients reveal their TB/LTBI status to the community. Research from Amambai and its neighbor district, Dourados, has shown that the number of contacts needed to treat to prevent one additional case was 10 (CI: [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] for contacts with a tuberculin skin test (TST) reaction �10mm (38% of contacts) [30] significantly lower than a recent average global estimate of 100 [31] . With irregular TST supplies, the healthcare service in the study area gives all household contacts LTBI treatment without prior TST testing. In Amambai only around 60% of contacts are evaluated because of the high mobility of this population, particularly men employed in plantations away from home [32] . Recent genotyping analysis of TB isolates from Dourados showed that transmission occurred outside the household [33] , pointing to a need for better contact tracing. Based on our findings, contact tracing strategies need to consider not only the transient household structure but also the influence of secondary TB stigmatization in this population.\n"," While most patients experienced support from their household, patients, relatives, and community members gave examples of experienced/enacted stigma including avoidance, gossiping, exclusion from religious communities, and sharing meals and joining in for a tererê. Although most participants related that this social exclusion would last until the completion of TB treatment, the internalized/self-stigma of lowered self-esteem persisted. Interventions to build empowerment of patients and their relatives have shown promising results elsewhere [23, 24] . So-called stigma clubs that provide a forum for patients and their families could be a suitable intervention in this setting [34] .\n"," The conceptualization of stigma is increasingly recognized as similar to discrimination, both rooted in broader political, historical, and cultural power structures, inter-and intrapersonal attitudes to a given population group, and perceptions of health and disease [35] [36] [37] . TB patients belonging to marginalized groups often suffer social exclusion and discrimination, potentially compounding the effect of TB stigma and raising the barrier to care [19] . The International Labour Organization has reported intersectional stigma associated with being indigenous and living with HIV and/or TB in Europe, Africa, Australia, North and South America [38] . In a study of high-risk populations in Canada, Gibson et al (2005) found that TB stigmatization was more common in indigenous communities than in immigrant groups (14% versus 3%). For indigenous participants, stigmatization of TB was related to current and past experiences of discrimination of indigenous people, with past forced removals to TB sanatoria still affecting the perception of TB treatment [39] . Our results show that TB-associated stigma has an important impact on TB control in this indigenous community, and that interventions aimed at eliminating the systemic discrimination suffered by this population are urgently needed to reduce TB transmission. Isolation of indigenous TB patients in sanatoria in MS was replaced by decentralized treatment only in recent decades. Our findings suggest that more work needs to be done towards more culturally sensitive healthcare, and that more research is needed on the stigma and power structures in the relationship between the healthcare service and indigenous populations in Brazil.\n"," To our knowledge, our study is the first detailed study of TB-associated stigma in an indigenous population in a high-burden country, and the first public health study to employ a community-based participatory research (CBPR) model in an indigenous population in Brazil. CBPR collaborations raise questions on power dynamics between external researchers, community researchers and interview participants [40, 41] . Developing the interview instruments in collaboration between non-indigenous and indigenous researchers and using Guarani as the interview language acted as a leveler of power. The young age of LP, AB, and the JIGA members also contributed to putting interview participants at ease as they were considered equals by the younger participants and non-superior by the older participants. IVK may have enjoyed a neutral position being a foreigner without ties to the Brazilian social and health services. As a woman, and also speaking Portuguese as a second language, may have contributed to the acceptance of IVK into the homes of the interview participants as she was perceived as a less dominant representative of non-indigenous society. We found that the CBPR model shows promise for working towards filling the data gap on TB and a better understanding of the intersectional stigma in indigenous populations.\n"," Our study only included patients who had received biomedical TB treatment from the healthcare service. We do not know if, and possibly how many, TB patients choose to get treatment exclusively from traditional healers. A study of healthcare performance in a neighboring Guarani-Kaiowá territory described how the concept of a Likert-scale questionnaire was poorly understood [42] . Formally validating a quantitative research instrument was further hindered by the scattering of the Guarani-Kaiowá in small and distant territories. During previous fieldwork, we found that the organization of Guarani-Kaiowá society in closed clan entities makes focus groups unsuitable for stigma studies in this setting. We therefore chose semi-structured interviews for data collection. Triangulation of the data was made possible by interviewing patients and their relatives as well as community members who had not been personally affected by TB.\n"," The interviews were translated from Guarani to Portuguese, and into English for the excerpts in the published text. Although great care was applied to ensure as accurate a translation as possible, minor discrepancies may have occurred where differing syntax obstructs literal translation. However, as authors LP, AB, and IVK discussed each interview in detail immediately after its conclusion and during the translation process to clarify the exact meaning of what was said, we believe to have reduced the impact of translation on our interpretation of the data as much as possible.\n"," TB-associated stigma is an important barrier to seeking treatment and a factor in the continued transmission of the disease in the Guarani-Kaiowá communities. We identified a need for awareness campaigns about TB transmission in the community and among the healthcare service staff. Interventions such as stigma clubs to empower patients and their families are urgently needed to reduce stigmatization. These culturally adapted interventions must be developed in collaboration with community members and consider the role of traditional medicine in the community. Anticipating stigma and with limited opportunities for employment, Guarani-Kaiowá workers would delay treatment. Elimination of TB in this hyperendemic population is unlikely to be achieved without addressing the violations of the human rights of the Guarani-Kaiowá. The epidemiological and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on indigenous communities in Brazil is severe [43] , and presents an additional challenge to TB control in the Guarani-Kaiowá communities both in terms of potential further stigmatization of airborne diseases as well as the transfer of funds from TB control to the combat of COVID-19 [44] . \n","Score: 3.449525454702956\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof The role of schools in driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission: not just an open-and-shut case The role of schools in driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission: not just an open-and-shut case\n","Body Text: and (iv) similar rates of infection between schools and communities. However, there are significant methodological limitations associated with each of these early findings, and the ongoing pandemic has directly provided evidence that contradicts the initial findings. We detail the limitations of the evidence for these perceptions and provide strong evidence that schools can be an important SARS-CoV-2 transmission source (Table) .\n"," Susceptibility. Much of the evidence used to describe the decreased burden in children is dependent on symptom-gated testing, which is confounded by testing bias because children are more frequently asymptomatic. As a result, meta-analyses do not support the finding of reduced susceptibility to infection at this point. 2 Studies with surveillance testing strategies report schoolaged children being infected at comparable levels to adults. For instance, UK prevalence surveys in October 2020 in areas with open schools found the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in 18-25 year olds, followed by [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] year olds, with 5-11 year olds having comparable prevalence to working-age adults. 3 This is consistent with seroprevalence survey results in Italy, Utah and Wisconsin. 4, 5 Notably, many studies showing lower pediatric rates were conducted in the spring 2020 when schools were closed and children had lower contact rates. 5 Infectiousness. Early in the pandemic, data indicating children were infrequently the index case (first infection) within a family challenged the notion that children were infectious. 6 Similar to disease burden estimates, this was heavily confounded by lower contact rates of children during the lockdown phase and the lower likelihood of detection of asymptomatic index cases. When children are asymptomatic, their infection may only be detected after diagnosis of an older family member, meaning the infection order does not necessarily mimic case detection. Studies based on surveillance testing find childrens' infectiousness is at least equivalent to adults. Similar infectivity between children and adults has been reported for variants of concern such as B.1.1.7. 7 . The trajectory of the pandemic has also undermined arguments of reduced pediatric susceptibility or infectiousness. For the week ending January 20 children accounted for 25.5% of reported weekly COVID-19 cases (22.2% of the US population are under 18 years old) according to the American Academy of Pediatrics website (https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/). School transmission chains. Studies have reported a lack of observed in-school transmission events between children as evidence against school-based transmission (for example 8 ). This line of reasoning corresponds to the formal logical fallacy of interpreting an absence of evidence as evidence of absence. These studies relied on symptom-gated forward contact tracing, commonly used by U.S. schools. Detecting child-to-child transmission relies on the appearance and reporting of two consecutive symptomatic cases, connected by a transmission event. In a recent simulation study 1 , we examined the performance of such an approach taking into account the low fraction of pediatric COVID-19 infections that are symptomatic (21%) and the low likelihood of a case transmitting to others due to overdispersion (10%). Using a Markov model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we found approximately 4.4% of school-based child-to-child transmission events were detectable using symptom-gated forward contact tracing. Throughout the 2020 and 2021 school years, contact tracing was frequently conducted on a voluntary basis, with the determination of the SARS-CoV-2 status of the primary contact being optional. If optouts from contact tracing were nonrandom, then we would expect contact tracing efficiency as implemented in many US schools to be lower than 4%.\n"," Community and school rates of disease. A fourth line of evidence supporting the argument that schools do not contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 comes from a number of studies that show similar rates of infection in schools and their surrounding communities (for example 9 ).\n"," With datasets incorporating multiple counties and their corresponding school district, these studies show a correlation between the county in-school infection rate and the overall county. However, this line of reasoning corresponds to the formal logical fallacy of interpreting a correlation as implying (a lack of) causality.\n"," Ideally, we would determine the impact of school openings on the community through randomized studies. Without randomization, the causal flow could be in the opposite direction. If one starts from the premise that school transmission is more frequent than in the community and that there is free mixing between schools and communities, then the correlation between school and community COVID-19 levels would support the opposite conclusion. Chains of infection, once seeded inside schools, would spread rapidly into the surrounding communities, and communities with highest school-based transmission would also have the highest overall infection rates.\n"," In a recent study, we simulated this scenario to ask whether the rates and kinetics of detected cases in schools and communities would let us infer that schools were responsible for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if that were indeed the case. 1 Using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in children and adults (with age-specific contact rates and location-specific transmission probabilities) we asked the question, \"if transmission rates in schools were (hypothetically) far higher than the community, would detected case rates in schools allow us to see that?\" Despite the simulated higher infection prevalence in children, detected case rates in children appeared similar to or lower than those of adults, and as total infection rates in the population increased, the gap between detected case rates narrowed. 1 This suggests that open schools would seed chains of infection that spread rapidly into the community, and given the relatively rapid kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the infection rates in schools and communities would quickly converge. 1 School reopening in the UK in the fall of 2021 led to a new spike in cases in the school-age population, which was followed shortly afterwards by a spike in cases in the 30-40 age group, consistent with a scenario where children are infected at school and subsequently infect their family members.\n"," Roughly half of the United States population is either in school, works in a school, or is a first degree contact of individuals in the previous two categories. It is not surprising that there are real-world data consistent with the possibility that in-school transmission can impact the disease burden in surrounding communities. In addition to the evidence just cited, we point out a few other key points.\n"," Compelling evidence of the impact of in-school transmission on case counts can be found by comparing counties where schools were conducting in-person learning to areas where schools were virtual. For example, a large online study in the US reported that individuals were more likely to report COVID-19 like symptoms in areas where schools were open compared to areas with remote learning, an effect that was attenuated in communities using multiple mitigation measures. 10 Similarly, school reopenings in regions of the US with limited measures in place to mitigate in-school transmission are associated with elevated case counts. 9\n"," A key concern with school reopening is the risk of superspreader events. Superspreading is an important driver of pandemics and, in particular, the COVID-19 pandemic. Ideal conditions for superspreading include prolonged indoor exposure between individuals with poor ventilation.\n"," Additionally, the most potent superspreaders have been individuals who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic and mobile. 11 Schools combine all of these elements with clear potential consequences for the children and staff they bring together and their communities.\n"," With that said, there is evidence that schools can operate successfully without significant inschool transmission when appropriate mitigation strategies are employed. The UK and Singapore both reopened with minimal in-school transmission in the summer term of 2020. A Japanese study matching in person and remote schooling communities showed no difference in cases in the surrounding communities between remote and in person schooling in spring 2020. 12 In each of these cases, community spread in the country was extremely low (incidence was consistently less than 1/100000 in Japan). Additionally, in-person schooling was conducted with multiple layered interventions such as masking, clear ventilation guidelines, and strict hygiene practices.\n"," Knowing that schools create an efficient setting for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is important that we implement multilayered strategies that are science-based and rigorously implemented. We describe several key components here.\n"," Limit transmission by infected individuals. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is frequently airborne and aerosol-driven, even from asymptomatically-infected individuals, making it crucial to improve air quality effectively reducing indoor transmission. Appropriate ventilation is critical: regular turnover of the air inside a closed space dramatically decreases viral load. High-quality filtration units with a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) greater than 9 (corresponding to filters that can remove particles 3 microns or smaller in diameter) can be helpful. Ionizers purify the air in the room by creating negative ions that attach to aerosolized particles, increasing the rate at which they settle to the ground. There is a pressing need for clear science-backed standards for indoor air quality, formulated with the reduction of airborne transmission as a goal. Notably, there is a large gap between the standards that actually improve air quality and the standards that can be implemented. For example, in the US, some schools have modern HVAC with filters, but most do not, creating a problematic gap. Air quality monitoring should be conducted in schools, and parents, teachers, and school boards should be informed of the results and provided resources for needed improvements.\n"," As a second layer of defense, high quality, well-fitting masks have been shown to provide important protection against infection. Masking policies that fail to ensure high quality masks are used effectively will undermine their efficacy. While there have been calls in the popular press for removing the requirement for masks in school, these calls are not supported by science. 13 Given the waning efficacy of vaccines over time, and their vulnerability to immune evasion resulting from viral evolution, masks provide a critical layer of protection for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.\n"," Reduce the likelihood that infected individuals are in schools. Surveillance testing is a critical tool to identify and isolate infected individuals. At the university level, this has been shown to be extremely effective when testing has fast turnaround and contact tracing and isolation guidelines are clear. However slow turnaround times, using lower sensitivity rapid antigen tests, opt-in policies limiting participation and testing pools that are too large can undermine the efficacy of surveillance testing. Further, we advocate that changes to quarantine and isolation protocols should be made with the intention of limiting transmission in schools, as opposed to limiting time away from in-person learning. In addition, children who thrived under remote learning options, or for whom the risk of infection is too high (either due to their own health or the health of a household member) should be able to continue accessing remote learning indefinitely. This reduces the number of potentially infected individuals in school, further lowering the risk of in person schooling.\n"," Provide community support. Even the most rigorously implemented strategies are unlikely to provide sufficient protection against the flood of cases that come from widespread community transmission. Limiting community transmission will support schools and extend the runway for safe operation. Schools might need to nimbly shift to remote learning should community burden become too high. It is critical to prepare for this possibility so that educational quality is not compromised and ensure that all students have access to the necessary technology to engage in an equitable way. This includes developing necessary technologies and investment in infrastructure to enable engagement of the most vulnerable students. It is a critically important problem to solve: we must ensure that students who are most vulnerable to the consequences of a raging pandemic and remote learning continue to receive the education they need and that their communities are safe.\n"," Remove the fluff. We have learned that many mitigation measures are not effective and removing them will make it easier to focus on effective measures. This includes temperature checks, plexiglass barriers, and excessive surface cleaning. These mitigation measures become \"hygiene theater\" in that they provide false reassurance that interventions are in place while also being ineffective at preventing spread and contributing to \"pandemic fatigue\"declining trust in and energy for pandemic mitigations. Guidelines need to be updated and communicated as technologies are developed and science progresses. We need to move away from overly relying on vaccines to limit transmission, as they are only one part of what needs to be a multi-pronged strategy as new variants continue to emerge. While increasing levels of vaccination is an important public-health goal, as it mitigates the worst outcomes, vaccine efficacy against transmission should be complemented with other measures aimed to reduce transmission. This is particularly important as vaccine efficacy against transmission is known to wane against emerging variants and as time since vaccination increases. 14 It is important that schools adopt multiple strategies to limit transmission such as masking, given a correctly-fitted N95 mask provides a critical, substantial and reliable impediment to viral transmission. 15 Similarly, because some of the effective interventions (air quality improvement and testing in particular) have a nonlinear effect on risk mitigation, cutting corners on risk mitigation steps can degrade their utility very quickly. This is also hygiene theater and the use of theoretically effective but practically ineffective mitigation measures can again provide false reassurance and contribute to declining trust in mitigation. Assessing the effectiveness of these interventions in a data-driven way (for example, using CO2 monitors to assess air quality) is key. Model-based approaches should be used to pressure-test mitigation strategies, and governing authorities should update the science regularly to keep up with viral evolution.\n"," Throughout the course of the pandemic, the issue of how to keep schools open safely has been a consistently contentious and complicated issue. Unfortunately, the discussion has often centered around numerous false dichotomies and limited ambition on how to truly tackle this challenge. For instance, many discussions pit ostensible direct harms to children from mitigation measures against the direct harm to children from COVID-19 infection. Other discussions pit student mental health against protection from in-person transmission of disease. Framing the question in these ways creates what appears to be an impossible dilemma. Here, we argue that many of these dilemmas are not really dilemmas: children are inextricably a part of the community, and the harms from in-school transmission extend to the entire community and impact the trajectory of the pandemic; schools enable disease transmission and it is possible to curb transmission; children often do better learning in person and it is possible to keep them safely in school in the midst of the pandemic with appropriate mitigations.\n"," \"Learning to live with the virus\" is not synonymous with permitting rampant viral spread. Bringing the crisis phase of the current COVID-19 pandemic to an end is a goal that we all aspire towards, but it will take work on our part to make it come to pass-at present the disease is nowhere near achieving endemic conditions. The first step in that process is to limit disease spread and focusing on limiting in-school spread is critical for limiting transmission. Fortunately, we are close to the point where science-driven interventions make the goal of limiting in-school spread achievable. We should make it a public-health priority to keep schools open without accelerating the pandemic.\n","Score: 3.422021443965223\n","\n","Title: Epidemiology and Infection From the Field Reflections on a national public health emergency response to carbapenemase- producing Enterobacterales (CPE)\n","Body Text: The Enterobacterales include bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They are normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract, but can cause serious infections, including bloodstream infection (BSI). Carbapenems are broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobials used to treat Enterobacterales infections, resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and beta-lactam/betalactamase inhibitor combinations. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are increasingly important, especially those mediated by carbapenemases (i.e. carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE)) because these enzymes are encoded on mobile genetic elements that spread amongst different Enterobacterales [1] . These carbapenemases include K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), oxacillinase 48 (OXA-48) and the metallo-beta-lactamases, such as New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), with potential for widespread dissemination [2] .\n"," Because of delays in detection and starting appropriate treatment, those infected with CPE may be adversely affected. In an intensive care unit study, colonisation independently predicted CRE infection [3] . A multi-centre study found that carbapenem resistance was associated with an increased length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality [4] .\n"," Key infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies include building core skills (e.g. behavioural changes, hand hygiene and cleaning), capacity and resources (e.g. staffing), the investigation of outbreaks, isolation/cohorting of positive patients and antimicrobial stewardship [5] . Strengthening laboratory diagnostics and increasing screening volumes are important as CPE detection is more challenging than for other multi-drug-resistant microorganisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There is increasing emphasis on environmental reservoirs, e.g. hospital sinks, showers, previously well recognised for other Gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa [6] .\n"," In Ireland, the Minister for Health declared a National Public Health Emergency (NPHE) on CPE in October 2017, as Ireland's first National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (iNAP) was being launched [7] . A NPHE Team (NPHET) was convened to focus efforts on improving resource provision (national and local), surveillance, enhancing communication, increased testing and the development of policies and guidance to limit dissemination. A CPE expert advisory group (EAG) was convened to provide evidence-based guidance to the NPHET. This EAG first met in December 2017 and reviewed surveillance data, responded to enquiries on preventative aspects and reviewed draft clinical guidelines, i.e. for acute hospitals and specific services, such as haemodialysis. It has also supported the NPHET in securing additional funding (€24.4 million with 301 whole time equivalents posts in 2018-2021). It has also reviewed the evolving epidemiology to inform national strategy and ensure alignment with the publicly funded healthcare service, the Health Service Executive's (HSE) antimicrobial resistance and infection control (AMRIC) implementation plan. An interim analysis of the effectiveness of that NPHE process has been recently reported [8] . Governance structures were established within the HSE to oversee and direct the establishment of a CPE Implementation Team (later incorporated into AMRIC Oversight and Implementation Teams) who were tasked with the implementation of guidance agreed by the CPE NPHET and EAG (e.g. implementation of CPE screening programme).\n"," In 2011, CRE was made a notifiable infection in Ireland. In 2012, the National Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacterales Reference Laboratory (NCPERL) was established. These decisions assisted in assessing the true extent of CPE. The declaration of an NPHE has given greater impetus to more widespread surveillance and improved IPC. Surveillance resulted in increased reporting of clusters and outbreaks. Although one of the best-characterised outbreaks was caused by NDM carbapenemase, CPE mediated by OXA-48 has been more common [9] . In one prevalence survey, 1.38% of in-patients were colonised, all with OXA-48 [10] . While 65% of CPE in Ireland in 2018 was from hospital inpatients and 87% from screening specimens, CPE has also been detected from patients attending general practitioners. In addition, CPE has been detected in aquatic environments, including hospital effluent, a potential route for wider dissemination [11] .\n"," The latest annual summary data to the end of 2020 is outlined in Figure 1 . Active surveillance maintained through the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demonstrates a low prevalence. Monthly updates to the end of September 2021 are available at https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/microbiologyantimicrobialre sistance/strategyforthecontrolofantimicrobialresistanceinireland sari/carbapenemresistantenterobacteriaceaecre/surveillanceofcpei nireland/cpemonthlysurveillancereports/AMRIC%20September %20%202021%20CPE%20monthly%20report-MC-Agreed.pdf. The data show a stable level of acquisition of CPE colonisation and ongoing detection from hospital environments where sampling is performed. Reference laboratory data show that the CPE genotype detected in hospital environments generally corresponds to that genotype acquired in that hospital (data not shown).\n"," Here, we reflect on a series of questions considered by the EAG to address ongoing issues and what needed to be done next (Table 1) .\n"," No. The declaration of an NPHE led to a structured programme of increased testing on acute hospital admission, based on national guidelines (https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/microbiologyantimi crobialresistance/strategyforthecontrolofantimicrobialresistanceini relandsari/carbapenemresistantenterobacteriaceaecre/guidanceand publications/Control%20of%20CPE%20in%20the%20acute%20hos pital%20setting.pdf), monthly reporting of CPE and an assessment of laboratory capacity. All new CPE are submitted to the NCPERL for characterisation.\n"," The term 'endemic' is classically applied to an infection. Here, it is appropriate to include CPE infection and colonisation. An endemic state implies that the condition persists at a baseline level in an area in the absence of continued new introduction.\n"," The rate of new detections for CPE appears to have reached a relatively stable plateau (approximately 15 per 100 000 population per year for 2019 and 2020, with 709 and 705 new detections, respectively, in a population of 4.9 million). The great majority has been in people with no history of travel outside Ireland, e.g. the index case in the first report of NDM CPE was admitted to hospital from the community [9] . Particular carbapenemases, such as KPC or OXA-48 and specific OXA-48 plasmids have persisted in some hospitals for over a decade [12] . While CPE is endemic in some hospitals that report monthly new acquisitions, most do not show this pattern. Although outbreaks in community long-term care facilities have occurred, there are no reports of persistent foci of acquisition. Therefore, it is not currently endemic in the community and hence there may be an opportunity to prevent it becoming endemic throughout the healthcare system.\n"," Is CPE acquisition still primarily associated with acute hospitals?\n"," Yes. CPE acquisition without associated in-patient hospital stay is relatively uncommon in Ireland. However, CPE has been detected in the partners of people with CPE, suggesting that the household transmission of CPE can occur.\n"," CPE has been detected in hospital effluent, sewage and seawater, emphasising the risk that CPE could disseminate into the wider environment from hospitals. However, in contrast to extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales, CPE is currently not as frequently detected in water outlets and sewage [13, 14] . This suggests that effective control or eradication may still be possible, as the main challenge is in hospitals.\n"," The enhanced focus on screening for asymptomatic carriage of CPE and contact precautions is likely to have limited person-to-person transmission. It is difficult to quantify the proportion of CPE acquired from person-to-person transmission, compared with persistent environmental reservoirs. However, based on isolates submitted to the NCPERL, the detection in damp areas (e.g. showers, sinks) is common in hospitals with persistent acquisition. The extent of this was not apparent until the widespread adoption of national guidance on sampling. Based on the match between environmental and patient isolates, we consider that acquisition from persistent environmental reservoirs is now a key factor in hospital acquisition. Therefore, an effective approach to manage the risk from persistent environmental reservoirs is needed.\n"," Should we increase the emphasis on reducing the risk from persistent reservoirs?\n"," Yes. In Ireland and elsewhere, CPE has been detected from showers, sinks and patient toilets in hospitals [6, 11] . Managing this requires the optimisation of infrastructure, including the installation of modern sanitary ware that is more appropriate for hospital settings, and effective cleaning/decontamination. Hospitals with ongoing transmission need to identify transmission hot spots with appropriate environmental testing. Our experience is that detection in the environment is critically dependent on sampling and testing methods. Sampling the hospital environment with a standard diagnostic swab fails to detect contamination that is revealed with more rigorous methods recommended by the CPE EAG (https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/health wellbeing/our-priority-programmes/hcai/resources/cpe/environmental-testing-for-carbapenemase-producing-enterobacterales.pdf). In the absence of suitable sampling methods, the extent of environmental contamination is likely to be underestimated. New approaches to reduce the level of CPE in drains and/or back wash from drains to touched surfaces, may also be required.\n"," What is the role of antimicrobial stewardship in controlling CPE acquisition?\n"," Exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents is a risk factor for CPE acquisition [15] . Antimicrobials probably select for CPE colonisation if a patient is exposed to CPE, and are likely to increase shedding of CPE in the faeces of colonised patients. Antimicrobials in urine and faeces may contribute to sustaining CPE in hospital drainage systems. Avoiding unnecessary antimicrobials and minimising the use of broad-spectrum agents are likely to be important in controlling CPE, and may reduce the risk of CPE gaining access to and persisting in hospitals.\n"," Does community acquisition and spread justify extending screening to the community?\n"," No. The greatest risk of transmission with adverse consequences, e.g. BSI, occurs in acute hospitals. Hence, this is where testing for carriage is most important. While there may be CPE carriers in the community, the risks of transmission and infection there are probably low. Furthermore, increasing the numbers tested on hospital admission will detect such patients. Therefore, currently there is no requirement to extend screening for CPE carriage outside of acute hospitals in Ireland, e.g. in nursing homes and other residential care units.\n"," Guidelines on CPE/CRE understandably focus on acute care [5, 16] . National priorities on controlling multi-drug-resistant bacteria will vary by country, epidemiology and the political This is a key factor, and therefore preventing person-to-person transmission may not be sufficient for control/eradication.\n"," Should we increase the emphasis on reducing the risk from persistent reservoirs?\n"," Yes. We need to sample appropriately and take measures to reduce spread from such reservoirs.\n"," What is the role of antimicrobial stewardship in controlling CPE acquisition?\n"," Limiting the use of antimicrobial agents may reduce acquisition, excretion and persistence in the hospital environment.\n"," Does community acquisition and spread justify extending screening to the community?\n"," No. Community acquisition is not currently a key factor and screening in the community is therefore not warranted.\n"," CPE, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales; IPC, infection prevention and control.\n"," priority it is accorded (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/g7-health-ministers-meeting-june-2021-communique/g7health-ministers-meeting-communique-oxford-4-june-2021).\n"," In Israel in the mid-2000s, a national strategy was implemented to control CPE in response to large numbers of cases [17] . This addressed testing, specific nursing staff assigned to CPE positive patients. A reduction in new acquisitions followed, prompting reform of national infrastructure for IPC, surveillance of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs), the strengthening of reference laboratories, a national programme for antibiotic stewardship and a focus on antimicrobial agents in agriculture.\n"," Most measures to contain CRE/CPE are generic, and apply to other HCAIs. Furthermore, as in Ireland, the declaration of an NPHE around CPE has supported and will continue to help co-ordinate investment in building IPC capacity and infrastructure, especially in hospitals with older buildings and outdated physical infrastructure.\n"," Failure to control CPE has significant financial consequences. An economic evaluation of a CPE outbreak in London in 2014-2015 estimated costs at €1.33 million, the largest cost being reduced capacity for elective procedures due to bed closures [18] . A simulation of a toolkit from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that cost savings were greatest if all hospitals implemented a regional coordinated approach [19] . Hence, such an approach across hospitals and applied nationally where possible, is most likely to be effective, and is a prudent use of resources.\n"," The declaration of the CPE NPHE, reflecting a strong policy commitment In Ireland, has seen a greater emphasis on the prevention of HCAIs and enhanced IPC measures. This national approach with associated governance arrangements, performance measurements, management systems and structures has supported and informed the establishment of an NPHET to address the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. This has resulted in a coordinated and multi-agency approach, with many positive consequences. This was not the case in Ireland when MRSA or ESBL-producing Enterobacterales emerged some decades ago, with both becoming irreversibly endemic in the country.\n"," Following the NPHE response, CPE acquisitions have stabilised [8] (and Fig. 1 ). This reflects progress in reducing person-to-person acquisition through the detection of colonised individuals and the implementation of transmission-based precautions. However, surveillance for acquisition, environmental sampling and molecular characterisation of isolates has suggested a key role for persistent environmental reservoirs in hospitals. These have likely contributed to failures to eradicate CPE acquisition in some hospitals, notwithstanding rigorous measures to reduce person-to-person transmission. Therefore, measures to manage person-to-person transmission, must be accompanied by a focus on environmental monitoring and control, to drive the transition from stable levels to progressive reduction and even eradication.\n","Score: 3.3545679017555967\n","\n","Title: The Lancet Regional Health -Western Pacific 17 (2021) 100299 The Lancet Regional Health -Western Pacific\n","Body Text: The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) has increased rapidly in many countries including the United Kingdom, United States of America, India and Singapore. 1 Vaccination has been reported to prevent symptomatic disease 2 , 3 and hospitalizations related to Delta variant infection. To reduce the spread of disease, it is important also to determine the impact of vaccination on preventing any infection, regardless of symptoms, and the relative risk of onward transmission of disease from vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals, which remains unknown. As asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals are potential sources for onward transmission, especially in populations that do not have high levels of immunity, understanding vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition is essential for transmission risk assessment. 4 Accurately determining secondary attack rates regardless of symptoms remains challenging as many settings rely on symptombased SARS-CoV-2 testing. Symptom-based testing will not detect asymptomatic infections and mild non-medically consulted infection. 5 This challenge can be addressed by studies of close contacts with routine SARS-CoV-2 testing regardless of symptoms to detect asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases. As household contacts of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases are likely to be highly exposed to the case and are known to be at high-risk of infection [5] [6] [7] , they are an ideal group to provide estimates of the impact of variants and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 attack rates.\n"," We examined the impact of the Delta variant and vaccination among household close-contacts of all locally-acquired COVID-19 cases in Singapore, an island city-state in Southeast Asia with 5.8 million people. Since the identification of the first COVID-19 case on Jan 23, 2020, active contact tracing has been conducted to identify all close-contacts of every COVID-19 case. Close-contacts are quarantined for 14 days with routine PCRs conducted at entry to and exit from quarantine since May 2020. Whole genome sequencing is also performed on all local COVID-19 cases with a RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of less than 30. This cohort, where index case-contact pairs were known, provided a unique opportunity to determine secondary attack rates and risk factors for COVID-19 transmission.\n"," This retrospective cohort study included all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 index cases in Singapore issued legallybinding quarantine orders between September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Since January 2, 2020, surveillance for COVID-19 in Singapore has been conducted according to regularly-reviewed Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 guidance. Since July 1, 2020, all persons aged 13 years old and above presenting with symptoms of febrile or non-febrile acute respiratory infection for any duration were actively offered to have a respiratory swab taken for RT-PCR testing. In addition, all close contacts of COVID-19 cases were also mandated to be tested by PCR upon entry and exit from quarantine, ensuring that additional cases are identified for further contact tracing. Physicians are required by law to report all COVID-19 cases to MOH. A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory specimens. 8 Contact-tracing was performed by MOH for every diagnosed COVID-19 case. 9 Household close contacts were defined as persons who shared the same residential address as the index case, regardless of duration or proximity of contact. All identified close contacts were placed under legally-binding quarantine for 14 days, during which they were not allowed to leave their residence or assigned location. Persons under quarantine were monitored daily for development of symptoms, and symptomatic contacts were transferred to hospital via a dedicated transport service for COVID-19 testing and clinical evaluation. Regardless of symptoms, all quarantined close contacts were tested for COVID-19 by PCR, upon entry and exit from quarantine. The secondary attack rate was defined as the number of PCR-confirmed cases detected among all household close contacts of the index case.\n"," All confirmed COVID-19 cases were isolated in hospital until MOH-specified discharge criteria were met. All cases of possible COVID-19 reinfection are independently adjudicated by an expert panel comprising specialists in infectious diseases and laboratory medicine.\n"," The National Public Health Laboratory started whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 variants routinely since December 2020. WGS was attempted for all SARS-CoV-2 positive cases with a RT-PCR Ct value of less than 30. Variant analysis was performed using Pangolin COVID-19 lineage assigner 10 and CovSurver connected to GISAID 11 , 12 to assign and verify lineages to each sequence.\n"," By end May 2021, only the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines (authorised for use in Singapore on December 14, 2020 and February 3, 2021, respectively) had been offered to citizens and long-term residents on a voluntary basis under the national vaccination programme. The vaccination exercise was initiated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on December 30, 2020, prioritising healthcare and frontline workers 13 , and was expanded to the community-at-large, starting with seniors aged 70 and above from February 2021 and seniors aged 60 to 69 from end March 2021. 14 As of May 30, 2021, approximately 2.3 million individuals (40% of the population) have received at least the first dose of the vaccine, of whom over 1.7 million individuals (30% of the population) have completed the full vaccination regimen. 73% of eligible seniors aged 60 and above, 72% of eligible persons aged 45 to 59 and 60% of those aged 40 to 44 have received the vaccine or scheduled a vaccination appointment. 15 Both index cases and close contacts were considered to be partially vaccinated if they had received one vaccine dose before the day the quarantine order was issued, or were within 14 days of the second dose on the day the quarantine order was issued. If more than 14 days had elapsed after their second dose, they were taken to be fully vaccinated.\n"," Data on the index cases and associated close contacts were obtained from MOH's contact tracing database. For both, demographic information, residential address and vaccination status (i.e. vaccine type, number of doses received and vaccination dates for received doses) were obtained. Additionally, unique national case number, date of COVID-19 diagnosis, WGS-confirmed variant assignment, date of symptom onset, date of hospital admission and reinfection status were obtained for index cases, while start date of quarantine, and if applicable, confirmed COVID-19 status, date of COVID-19 diagnosis and symptom onset, WGS-confirmed variant assignment, whether supplemental oxygen or intensive care were required, and reinfection status were obtained for close contacts. Symptom information was collected via interview by the MOH contact tracers soon after diagnosis while the requirement for supplemental oxygen or intensive care was determined throughout the duration of inpatient care.\n"," Close contacts residing in foreign worker dormitories (as it is difficult to define a household in that setting), those of overseas or imported cases, and those lacking index case information were excluded. The remaining close contacts were linked to communityacquired cases (\"community\" close contacts), including household close contacts. If multiple linked index cases were listed for a close contact in the national records, the earliest-diagnosed index sharing the same residence as the contact was selected for analysis. It was assumed that all recorded cases in February 2021 and earlier with missing variant status information in the database were infected with variants other than the Delta variant of concern (\"non-Delta variant\"), as the first detection of the Delta variant in Singapore was in April 2021.\n"," MOH actively investigates every new case for epidemiologicallylinked transmission to prior cases and groups cases into transmission clusters which are reported. 15 All cases with individuallyassigned variant status in an epidemiologically-linked transmission cluster were found to have identical variant assignment. As such, cases with no individually-assigned variant status were assigned the transmission cluster variant if available.\n"," Until the emergence of the Delta variant, the number of cases during the study period was low, and as a result, there were insufficient numbers of the other variants to analyze them separately. We therefore grouped all non-Delta variants together. Three outcomes were considered: infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease (defined as either need for supplemental oxygen, and/or intensive care admission), though the small number of contacts with severe infection precluded some analyses of the final endpoint. We characterised contacts by their vaccine status and the variant they were exposed to, to account for potentially different protection against the Delta variant conferred by the vaccines. We adjusted for the age and gender of both index case and contact, the vaccine status of the index case, and the number of days of exposure from symptom onset or notification of the index to his or her isolation in a healthcare facility as these co-variates have prior data supporting possible effects on SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. [16] [17] [18] [19] To accommodate clustering we used generalized estimating equations in the logistic regression and bootstrap at the cluster level to derive relative risks, and hence vaccine effectiveness. In sensitivity analysis, we bootstrapped and adjusted for significant covariates through logistic regression.

However, older index cases had more secondary infections (aOR 1.20 per decade, 95%CI 1.03-1.39) ( Table 3 ) . There was no evidence of other demographic effects on acquisition or symptomatic illness ( Table 3 and Supplementary Table 3) .

There is a significantly higher risk of infection among unvaccinated close contacts by the Delta variant compared to other variants (RR 2.01, 95%BCI 1.24-3.84). This would explain the rapid and extensive epidemic in India, the first country that reported the Delta variant in late 2020 1 ; other South Asian countries with Delta variant-driven epidemics; and the difficulty in controlling the outbreaks caused by the Delta variant in countries and regions such as Singapore and Australia that have hitherto been successful in containing COVID-19 spread. 1 , 22 , 23 This could be due to the higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding in persons infected with the Delta variant (Singapore unpublished data), and should be the focus of further studies on SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n"," An interesting finding is that older primary cases had more secondary infections than younger cases did (aOR 1.20 per decade, 95%RCI 1.03-1.39), a finding corroborated by prior studies. A study from Korea of 4,048 household clusters determined that SARS-CoV-2 transmission was more common from adults to children than from children to adults. 24 The increased transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from adults compared with children was also supported by studies from Spain and Germany. 25 , 26 This is unlike many other respiratory diseases such as influenza, where children and young adults tend to be the conduits of transmission. 27 More studies should be performed to determine the possible causes for this observationwhether older cases have more viral shedding, or increased interaction with household members that facilitate transmission. Among contacts exposed to the Delta variant, there is a lower risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 for fully vaccinated compared to unvaccinated contacts (Relative risk [RR] against symptoms, provide important information on the overall effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines used in Singapore. While the estimated vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% against Delta variant acquisition (regardless of symptoms) and 64.1% against symptomatic disease is lower than the 88% (95%CI 85.3-90.1) reported for the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine at preventing symptomatic infection by the Delta variant in England 3 , it is important to note that the household setting is one where vaccine effectiveness estimates are likely to be the lowest, given the context of prolonged close contact between members of the same household. Our estimates show that even for the Delta variant, the mRNA vaccines remain very effective at preventing all infections-both symptomatic and asymptomatic. Asymptomatic infections, if unprevented and undetected, can be the conduits of community transmission for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to preventing infections, vaccinated individuals also have significantly less severe outcomes if infected 2 , although in this study the absence of any severe outcomes in the vaccinated group prevented accurate estimation of the residual risk of severe Covid-19. The estimate of 100% vaccine effectiveness against this outcome should therefore be treated with caution.\n"," Our analysis did not demonstrate a statistically-significant reduction in household contact SARS-CoV-2 acquisition comparing vaccinated index cases with unvaccinated index cases. Our point estimate suggested a possibility of reduced onward transmission and the ability to demonstrate a statistically-significant difference could be affected by the study sample size and index case misclassification. Primary cases who are vaccinated are less likely to experience symptomatic infection 3 , and thus less likely to be tested and diagnosed as index cases. As individuals with more symptoms are associated with increased infectiousness 28 , underdetection of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic vaccinated index cases could result in underestimation of the preventive effect of vaccination on onward transmission to household contacts. In comparison, Harris and colleagues found that the likelihood of household transmission (pre-Delta) was lowered by approximately 40 to 50% in vaccinated index patients 29 , and another study (pre-print) from Guangdong, China, reported that unvaccinated Delta index cases were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received two doses of vaccine. 30 If infected cases who are vaccinated remain sources of onward infection, it is important to ensure that testing and isolating of cases, and public health measures to prevent the community spread of COVID-19, remain in place until high levels of immunity from vaccination and/or natural infection is present. Many countries are relaxing measures such as mask-wearing and testing for vaccinated indvidiuals. 31 , 32 If these are not in place, infection among vaccinated individuals, especially if asymptomatic or mild, are likely to go undetected and may result in spread to other individuals who are not immune to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in further waves of infection.\n"," This study has some limitations. The risk of household contacts acquiring infections from non-household sources cannot be excluded, but this would be minimal due to the low number of community cases in Singapore during the study period. The index case, which is the first diagnosed COVID-19 infected person in the household may in some cases not be the true primary case of infection. However this scenario would likely be minimized due to aggressive contact tracing and establishment of transmission chains in Singapore since the first diagnosed case, and where possible the assignment of the index case would be dependent on the earliest symptom onset or likely transmission source outside of the household. 33 , 34 The older age of vaccinated indexes could have affected the estimates of the preventive effect of vaccination on onward transmission, a confounding which was adjusted for in the logistic regression ( Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4 ).\n"," Contacts' symptom data was based on interview by MOH contact tracers soon after index case diagnosis and may have resulted in pre-symptomatic individuals (who were asymptomatic at time of interview) being classified as asymptomatic, a misclassification which could affect the estimates of vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease and not the esimates of vaccine effectiveness against acquisition or severe illness. Chronic disease data is not routinely captured in the MOH contact tracing database and hence we were not able to adjust for chronic disease in our risk factor analysis. Multiple null hypothesis significance tests were conducted, based on potential risk factors that were deemed epidemiologically important, and so some caution should be taken in interpreting the results as no correction for multiple testing was attempted. Bonferroni correction for the logistic regression would result in the age of vaccinated indexes not meeting threshold for statistical significance but would not alter the inference with regards to fully vaccinated individuals.\n"," The majority of non-Delta household indexes occurred prior to March 2021 and all the household Delta index cases occurred after March 2021, and there were differences in public measures between these time periods. The main measure potentially affecting household exposures is the increased recommendation for telecommuting (Supplementary Table 2 ). If there was significantly increased exposure time within the household as a result, this may contribute to over-estimation of the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant but would not be expected to bias the estimates of vaccine effectiveness or determinants of Delta variant transmission.\n"," Individuals exposed to the Delta variant have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition compared to those exposed to other variants. This risk is reduced by 55% among vaccinated individuals, which shows the importance of high vaccination coverage to increase population-level immunity. Our findings suggest that vaccinated cases remain at risk of onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Delta, and therefore it is important to continue to contain spread through testing and isolation, and public health measures to prevent widespread community transmission if significant numbers of at risk persons remain unvaccinated.\n"," OTN and KM conceived of and led the study.

As public health officials continue grappling with reducing community spread, it is of increased importance to understand transmission risk in different locations where people mix. Transmission within households may be especially important, given the mounting evidence that indoor environments with close, sustained contact are especially high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission [1] [2] [3] . Furthermore, with substantial observed decreases in mobility during the pandemic [4] , individuals likely are spending a greater proportion of time at home, thus increasing the importance of understanding within-household transmission. Likewise, isolation and quarantine measures recommended to help control COVID-19 frequently occur within homes, increasing risk to susceptible household members [5] .\n"," Data collected from members of households with at least one person infected with SARS-CoV-2 have revealed a wide range of within-household transmission estimates. One systematic review and meta-analysis [6] found 24 studies with household data conducted from January-March 2020, mostly in China, with secondary attack rate estimates ranging from 5% to 90% in the individual studies; pooling these data led to an average secondary attack rate estimate of 27% (95% CI: 21%-32%). Another published review and meta-analysis of more recent data found 22 studies on the secondary attack rate in households, including estimates ranging from 4% to 32% [7] . Pooling these studies, the review found an average secondary attack rate of 17.1% (95% CI: 13.7%-21.2%). Another review and meta-analysis found 40 household studies with individual study estimates ranging from 4% to 45% [8] . Their pooled analysis found that the household-based secondary attack rate for all household contacts was 19.0% (95% CI: 14.9 -23.1%). Data from households in the U.S. [9] [10] [11] [12] produced secondary attack rate estimates from 11% to 53%.\n"," Most household studies generated data by first identifying index household cases via active or passive surveillance followed by monitoring and testing specimens from their household contacts using PCR or other methods that detect presence of the virus. These studies may exhibit bias if mild or asymptomatic cases were less likely to be identified as an index household case. By contrast, data for the presence of antibodies among household members provide information on the distribution of final sizes of household outbreaks no longer in progress and in which some or none of the cases were identified at the time. We are aware of only 3 studies that used serological antibody data to estimate household transmission, using data from Spain [13] , Brazil [14] , and Switzerland [15] .\n"," In addition to average transmission rates, heterogeneity and variability in SARS-CoV-2 transmission have also been quantified. The amount of individual-level variation in the number of secondary infections can affect final outbreak size [16] . Large variation (i.e., overdispersion) indicates the presence of superspreading by a minority of individuals who transmit to a disproportionately large number of others [17] . Better understanding of superspreading individuals and locations can greatly enhance efficient targeting of transmission control strategies [18] . Backward contact tracing can efficiently trace sources of acquisition to high-transmission individuals and circumstances when superspreading is present [19] , and efforts that target similar circumstances for transmission prevention can have disproportionate benefits [20, 21] .\n"," Studies have quantified the variability in the number of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions from infected individuals using the dispersion parameter k, governing the variance of a negative binomially distributed offspring distribution [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Those studies estimated high overdispersion (low values of k) similar to what was observed during the first SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 [17] . These estimates were derived from data on transmissions, including superspreading events, occurring in a variety of locations both inside and outside of households. Regarding household transmission specifically, Madewell et al. [8] showed preliminary evidence of overdispersion in household data, with more households than expected experiencing extremes of transmission (i.e., either no transmission or many transmissions) from an introduced case.\n"," In this study, we combine SARS-CoV-2 data from serological antibody tests and selfreported prior tests to estimate within-household transmission of COVID-19 in Utah. Previously published secondary attack rate estimates are largely based on crude formulae which ignore the probabilities of multiple members of a household acquiring infection from the community, multiple generations of transmission within the household (i.e. secondary, tertiary, etc. transmissions), and imperfect test sensitivity and specificity. We addressed these limitations by extending previous models of final household outbreak size distributions [27] to develop a novel probabilistic model of household importation and household transmission combined with test sensitivity and specificity. Our model also quantifies variability in household transmission and the potential extent of overdispersion, to shed light on superspreading phenomena and the implications of household transmission for population-level controllability of COVID-19.\n"," Details of our data collection process are described elsewhere [28] . Briefly, the Utah Health & Economic Recovery Outreach project involved selecting households in several counties in Utah by population sampling designed to form a set of households by which average community seroprevalence could be assessed. Any member of selected households could participate in a survey that included questions about prior SARS-CoV-2 test results (see Supplementary Methods in S1 File for wording of relevant survey questions). Adult household members could fill out surveys on behalf of children of any age in the household. Survey participants age 12 or older could additionally opt to provide serological samples for COVID-19 antibody testing. Serum specimens were analyzed using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay performed on an Abbott Architect i2000 instrument (Abbott Laboratories), with methodology and criteria for a positive antibody result defined according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data included in this analysis were collected between May 4 and August 15, 2020.\n"," The University of Utah Institutional Review Board reviewed the surveillance project that produced the data analyzed in this manuscript and determined it as non-research public health surveillance, waived the requirement for documented consent, and determined that use of these data for analysis to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was exempt from further review (IRB_00132598). Individuals were informed of the project procedures and that participation was voluntary. Participants provided their agreement to participate and were given the chance to opt out of having their data used for future research. The data were analyzed anonymously for this manuscript.\n"," The data are represented as follows. For each household in the dataset, we captured the following 7 values from the data:\n"," • n: total number of people in household Those surveyed participants who reported no prior positive test result includes both those who had never been tested and those who had been tested but received no positive results. We did not have sufficient information to properly distinguish those two groups, nor to determine the circumstances of any prior negative tests that might affect the inferred probability of true prior infection.\n"," Each of the C unique combinations of the above 7 values found at least once in the dataset was indexed as a vector y i :\n"," We tallied the number of households for which each y i occurred in the frequency elements f i , and represented the entire dataset by the vector y = (y 1 ,. . .,y C ,f 1 ,. . .f C ).\n"," The dataset y and all codes, written in R version 4.0.3, used for analyses described in the following sections are posted and publicly available at https://github.com/damontoth/ householdTransmission.\n"," Here we derive the probabilities M kn for the probability that k out of n total household members ended up infected. If k members of a size-n household were infected, that means that n−k members escaped being infected by a non-household member (called \"community\" acquisitions) and escaped being infected by any of the n infected within the household. Thus, our model for M kn combines both probabilities and does not depend on the order of occurrence of household transmissions and subsequent community acquisitions after the initial one, as in similar prior formulations [27] . Also following prior formulations, we assume that active infections were not present in the households at the time of antibody data collection (i.e., that household outbreaks had reached final size). Accounting for the timing of recent household importations, transmissions, and development of detectable antibodies during an ongoing household outbreak would significantly complicate the model equations and would likely have little effect on our overall results, given that the prevalence of active infections at the time of data collection was very low [28] .\n"," The M kn values depend on 3 parameters. The parameter p c is the average per-capita probability of community acquisition, p h is the mean transmission probability from an infected person to a fellow household member, and d h is the dispersion parameter characterizing variability in transmissibility across infected individuals, with no assumed correlation among members of the same household.\n"," For a given household size n�2, the formula for M kn is:\n"," For households of size n = 1, note that the expression involving the household transmission parameters does not apply and we have M 01 = 1−p c and M 11 = p c .\n"," The probability that a household of size n had 0 infections: M 0n = (1−p c ) n , is the probability that none of the household members acquired infection from the community and does not depend on the household transmission variables because no household transmissions were possible without a community introduction. For the final number of household infections to be nonzero, there must be at least one community acquisition, which may be followed by within-household transmissions. The n i ! ðp c Þ i ð1 À p c Þ nÀ i expression is the binomial probability that i out of the n household members had a community acquisition, and the function T xyz is the probability that x already infected household members lead to a total of y transmissions to z susceptible household members. In other words, T xyz is the probability that the final outbreak size is x+y, given that x household members are already infected in a house with z susceptible members. For efficiency of computation, the T xyz values are calculated in order of increasing values of y, i.e. T x0z for each relevant x and z value are calculated first, then the T x1z values, then T x2z . This allows the use of T xyz values for lower values of y to be used in the formula (see S1 File for details): Within the T xyz formula, the function H xyz is the probability that x infected household members transmit infection directly to y out of z fellow household members who are susceptible. The H xyz values are calculated in order of increasing values of x for efficient computation (see S1 File):\n"," Finally, the function F yz (p, d) is the probability mass function of the beta-binomial distribution for y successes out of z trials, parameterized by a mean success probability p and a dispersion parameter d. When d is finite and nonzero, F yz is derived from the binomial distribution with success probability that is a beta-distributed random variable with parameters α = dp, β = d (1−p) , with decreasing variance as d increases. We also make use of the boundary cases d = 0 and d!1. In the limit d!1, holding p constant, F yz becomes the binomial distribution with constant success probability p (S1 File). In the maximal variance limit, d!0, with p held constant, F yz becomes an \"all-or-nothing\" distribution where y = z successes occur with probability p and to y = 0 successes occur with probability 1−p (S1 File):\n"," The function B is the beta function. We use F yz within the formula for H 1yz to quantify the distribution of household transmissions directly from a single infected household member, where y is the number of transmissions, z is the number of susceptible household members, p = p h , and d = d h .\n"," The above formulas are derived in the S1 File. Elements of this model appear in other publications. Longini and Koopman [27] derived a formula for M kn for the model with no variability among households or individuals, equivalent to our model with d h !1. While they provided a more efficient formula that takes advantage of the properties of that special case, we confirmed that our calculation scheme above reproduces the results of their formula. Becker [29] published explicit formulas for the final size of household outbreaks after a single introduction to households up to size 5 using the beta-binomial chain model, equivalent to our T xyz for x = 1 and z up to 4. We confirmed that our scheme for calculating T xyz produces the same results as their example formulas for arbitrary values of p h and d h .\n"," We sought to use our data to simultaneously estimate the 3 parameters (p c , p h , d h ) using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). However, applying the M kn formula directly to our data would be problematic because the true number of infections k in each household are not known with certainty. The data include two sources of COVID-19 test information by which prior infection status of a portion of individual household members can be probabilistically inferred: antibody test results and surveys in which participants could report results of a prior test.\n"," Antibody test results are subject to imperfect sensitivity and specificity due to false negative tests and false positive tests, respectively. To account for these, we added two additional parameters to be estimated by the MLE: ϕ A , the probability that an antibody-tested person with a prior infection tested positive for antibodies, and π A , the probability that an antibodytested person with no prior infection tested negative for antibodies.\n"," Prior test results for SARS-CoV-2 reported on the survey also do not perfectly identify those with prior infections. To quantify this imperfection, we introduced two more parameters to be estimated by the MLE: ϕ V , the probability that a surveyed person with a prior infection reported receiving a positive test for the virus, and π V , the probability that a surveyed person with no prior infection did not report receiving a positive test.\n"," Some household members received a survey but no antibody test and other members received neither. The M kn formula depends on the total household size n, which for many households includes individuals with missing data. For households with at least one but not all members infected (1�k�n−1) and in which less than n member were full participants, the likelihood formula required the probability that different portions of the k infected members were among those who were antibody tested or surveyed only. To arrive at our formula, we assumed that the antibody-tested and surveyed-only portion of a household were a random sample of household members with respect to their prior infection status. I.e., we assumed that those individuals in a participating household with and without prior infections were equally likely to participate in the study and equally likely to agree to antibody testing.\n"," In all we have 7 variables to be estimated by MLE, encapsulated in the following vector θ:\n"," The log likelihood of the dataset y described in Section 2.1 with variable set θ is then\n"," To present the formula for Lðy i jθÞ, the likelihood of a particular y i , we first define the following quantities calculated from the core elements of y i listed in Section 2.1: \n"," In the formula, the function A quantifies the probability of observing the given set of test result combinations among antibody-tested people (a PPi , a PNi , a NPi , a NNi ), given that (u, v, w, x) of them had a prior infection, respectively. E.g., u is the number of the a PPi household member who had an infection (true positives), v is the number of the a PNi household members who had an infection (true positive by prior test and false negative by antibody test), w is the number of the a NPi household members who had an infection (true positive by antibody test and did not report a prior positive test), and x is the number of the a NNi household members who had an infection (false negative by antibody test and did not report a prior positive test). The formula for A is\n"," The function f m (r; p) is the probability mass function for the multinomial distribution, where the number of trials is the sum of the elements of r, which are the number of infected or uninfected antibody-tested people who received each of the four possible test result combinations. The vector p contains the probability of each of the four test result combinations given that the person was infected (for p = p I ) or uninfected (for p = p U ):\n"," The first element of p I , ϕ V ϕ A , is the probability that an antibody-tested person with a prior infection reported a prior positive test (with probability ϕ V ) and also had a positive antibody test result (with probability ϕ A ). Note that ϕ A represents the sensitivity of the antibody test, but ϕ V includes both the sensitivity of the prior test and the probability that an infected person actually sought and received a SARS-CoV-2 test during the period of infection in which detectable virus was present and reported that positive test on our survey. Elements 2-4 of p I are the probabilities that an antibody-tested, prior infected person reported a prior positive test but tested negative for antibodies, did not report a prior positive test and tested positive for antibodies, and did not report a prior positive test and tested negative for antibodies, respectively. The elements of p U are the corresponding probabilities for individuals with no prior infection.\n"," The function S quantifies the probability of the survey-only data (s Pi , s Ni ) given that y of the s Pi individuals had a prior infection and z of the s Ni individuals had a prior infection:\n"," The function f b (q;r,p) is the probability mass function for the binomial distribution, for q successes given that there were r independent trials with probability p for success of each trial.\n"," The function H(k, k a , k s ) in the likelihood equation is the probability that, when k of n i individuals in the household were infected, k a infected individuals were among the a i individuals antibody tested and k s infected individuals were among the s i individuals surveyed but not antibody tested:\n"," is the probability mass function of the hypergeometric distribution for the number b of infected people selecting to be antibody-tested or surveyed-only, given that there were c infected people and d uninfected people available for selection in the household, and e people were tested or surveyed-only. These terms account for individuals in households who received neither an antibody test nor a survey, who may have included infected individuals. Our use of the hypergeometric distribution led from our assumption that, if some members of the household had a prior infection and others didn't, the antibody-tested / surveyed individuals were a random sample from the household with respect to their prior infection status.\n"," We maximized the log likelihood over the 7 unknown parameters (p c , p h , d h , ϕ V , ϕ A , π V , π A ) using the observations (n, a, s, a PP , a PN , a NP , s P ) for each household, to produce the MLE:\n"," The log likelihood maximization was performed using the \"optim\" function in R. We derived approximate confidence interval boundaries for an individual parameter θ i using the likelihood ratio test, using the statistic 2 logðLðŷÞ=LðyÞÞ, where θ consists of θ i freely varying and the other 6 elements of θ held at their optimal value. We defined a 95% confidence interval boundary where θ i produces a value for this statistic equal to the 95 th percentile of the chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom. We also plotted 2-dimensional confidence region boundaries for each of the 21 possible (θ i , θ j ) parameter pairs by allowing each pair to vary freely together while holding the other 5 at their optimal values. We calculated the boundary in the (θ i , θ j ) parameter plane where the likelihood ratio statistic equals the 95 th percentile of the chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. To calculate P-values at which certain fixed parameter values could be rejected in favor of the MLE, we used the chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of fixed parameters.\n"," Additionally, we developed a simulation model to produce synthetic data sets on which to test our likelihood model. We ran the simulation for the same number of households with the same sizes and participation rates for survey and antibody testing as in the actual data (fixed values of n, a, and s for each household). We randomized importations to households and simulated transmissions using the MLE values of the three epidemiological parameters p c , p h , and d h , randomized survey and antibody test results using the MLE sensitivity and specificity values, and maximized the likelihood against the simulated data. We repeated this process for 500 simulated data sets and recorded the median estimated value of each variable, for comparison against the MLE value that generated the data. We also used the 500 sets of simulation-based estimates as a parametric bootstrap to generate 95% confidence estimates for each variable, for comparison against the intervals generated from the likelihood ratio test.\n"," We also compared the performance of our 7-parameter model against simpler models with fewer free parameters, including models assuming d h = 0 and d h !1, models fixing the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test according to independent data from the test manufacturer (ϕ A = 89.3% and/or π A =99.6%) [32] , and models assuming perfect specificity of prior test result reporting or antibody testing (π V = 100% or π A = 100%). We tested each of these assumptions individually and in various combinations, resulting in models ranging from 3 to 6 optimized parameters. We compared the models using the Akaike information criterion, which aims to balance goodness of fit with model simplicity.\n"," Finally, we tested an alternate model that allows the community acquisition probability to vary by household, such that some households may have a higher per-capita acquisition rate than others applied to each household member. To quantify this probability in the alternate model, we employed the beta-binomial distribution for the number of community acquisitions in a household of a given size (see Supplementary Methods in S1 File).\n"," We quantified the implications of our household transmission variability estimates by calculating the probability of transmission extremes, compared to those produced by the classic binomial transmission model (d h = 1). Specifically, we calculated the probability that an initially infected individual transmits to no one or everyone in households of sizes from 2 to 10. For households of size n, the probability of no transmissions from the index infection is F 0,n−1 (p h , d h ) and the probability the index person transmits directly to the entire household is We also calculated an example of a dynamic transmission model that produces a distribution of household transmission probabilities close to that produced by our MLE beta distribution, using the method of moments. Specifically, if an infected person's duration of infectiousness is assumed to be fixed and transmissibility to a housemate is modeled as a gamma distribution with shape parameter k, then we solve for the value k that produces the same mean and variance for the transmission probability as that of the beta distribution with mean p h and dispersion d h (Supplementary Methods in S1 File). We solved for k using our MLEp h andd h values, and we derived a confidence interval for k using the pairs of (p h , d h ) estimates from our parametric bootstrap analysis.\n"," We calculated the within-household reproduction number R h , defined as the expected number of household transmissions directly from a community acquirer with all fellow household members susceptible:\n"," where μ and σ 2 are the mean and variance of the household size distribution, and p h is the secondary attack rate as determined by our MLE. This equation for R h is derived as in Ball et al. [30] and detailed in the S1 File.\n"," Additionally, we derived an alternate household reproduction number R � h defined as the expected total number of transmissions in the household of an infected person who acquired infection in the community and has no initially non-susceptible housemates. This differs from R h in that it counts all potential downstream transmissions in the household stemming from the index community acquirer. The formula for R � h , derived in the S1 File, is\n"," where h i is the fraction of all households that are size i.\n"," To investigate the implications of household transmission for population-wide transmission control, we use a threshold condition delineating subcritical and supercritical transmission in the population. Supercritical transmission occurs when R c ðR � h þ 1Þ > 1, where R c is the average number of community (non-household) transmissions from an infected person. We derive this formula in the S1 File, following Ball et al. [30] . We estimated R h , R � h , and the threshold value for R c by applying our MLE estimates of p h and d h to the above formulas and their confidence intervals by applying the (p h , d h ) pairs from each parametric bootstrap estimate.\n"," We compiled data from 9,383 households (Fig 1) . Of these, we retained 9,224 (98.3%) for use in the MLE. The 159 excluded households were removed because the household size was unknown (51) or the reported household size was less than the number of people tested or surveyed in the house (108). In the 9,224 retained households, there were 28,321 (3.07 per household) reported household members, 13,998 (1.52 per household) people who were both surveyed and antibody tested, and another 5,249 (0.57 per household) who were surveyed but not antibody tested. The households in the data were located in 7 of the 29 counties in Utah; the 22 excluded counties account for <14% of Utah's total population S1 Table in S1 File.\n"," Of the 13,998 antibody tests in the retained households, 178 (1.27%) were positive. Of those 178 people with a positive antibody test, 58 (32.6%) reported receiving a prior positive test. Of the 19,247 people who were antibody tested or surveyed only, 119 (0.62%) reported receiving a prior positive test. This broke down to 0.53% (75 / 13,998) for those who were antibody tested and 0.84% (44 / 5,249) for those who were surveyed but not antibody tested. The rate of testing positive for antibodies among those reporting a prior positive test was 77.3% (58 / 75). The interval between the reported prior positive test date and the antibody test date did not exhibit a strong correlation to the fraction of testing antibody positive, other than perhaps the 3 individuals reporting a very recent (less than 1 week) positive test all testing negative for antibodies (S2 Table in S1 File). The rate of survey participants agreeing to antibody testing was lower for those who reported a prior positivetest compared to those who did not: 63.0% (75 of 119) vs. 72.8% (13,923 of 19,128), a small but statistically significant (P < 0.01) difference in proportion.\n"," Of the retained households, 193 (2.1%) had at least one household member who either tested positive for antibodies or reported a prior positive test. There were 159 households with exactly 1 positive member (by either antibody test or reported prior test or both), 26 households with 2 positives, 6 with 3 positives, 1 with 4 positives, and 1 with 6 positives. In all, there were C = 273 unique y i vectors representing household data described in section 2.1.\n"," The crude secondary attack rate measure derived from antibody testing only (fraction of antibody-tested housemates of antibody-positive household members who were also antibody positive) was 14.9% (29 / 194 ). The crude secondary attack rate estimate from reported prior test data only (fraction of surveyed housemates of people reporting a prior positive test who also reported a prior positive test) was 23.0% (31 / 135). When combining both types of data, the crude secondary attack rate estimate (fraction of surveyed / tested housemates of any antibody-positive or reported-prior-positive person who were positive by either or both measures) was 15.6% (46 / 295).\n"," We tallied demographic statistics of the set of surveyed individuals (S3 Table in S1 File). The distribution of reported ages skewed older than Utah's overall population age distribution, and females were slightly overrepresented (52.0%). The distribution of surveyed individuals' race, Hispanic origin, and education level also differed from the overall Utah and U.S. distributions.\n"," Our MLE procedure produced simultaneous estimates for all 7 parameters (Table 1 ). The MLE for p c , the per-person community acquisition probability from outside the household, was 0.41% (0.32%-0.51%). For within household transmission probability, the MLE produced an average secondary attack rate estimate p h = 36% (27%-48%). The MLE for the dispersion [27] , could be rejected with P = 0.001 (Table 2 ). Our MLE result for ϕ V , the probability that a surveyed person with a prior infection reported a prior positive test, was 72% (62%-82%). The ϕ V value can be interpreted as the case ascertainment fraction, i.e. fraction of individuals with SARS-CoV infections who were identified with a positive test during their infection. Our result may be high compared to other areas of the U.S.: one study estimated that less than 60% of symptomatic cases in the U.S. were identified during February-June 2020 [31] . Our finding may reflect unusually successful case ascertainment efforts in Utah during the Spring and early Summer of 2020, perhaps partly owing to slower emergence compared to other regions.\n"," For π V , the probability that a surveyed person with no prior infection reported no prior positive test, the MLE was 99.94% (99.88%-99.98%). This result is consistent with the low probability of false positives among viral tests, which to our knowledge were exclusively PCRbased in Utah prior to our data collection. It is possible that some false positives in our survey data occurred by erroneous reporting, i.e. survey respondents reporting a prior positive test that did not occur, rather than via errors in testing procedure. Even though our MLE for this parameter was in excess of 99.9%, we found that an alternate model assuming π V = 100% produced notably different estimates of some of the other parameters (Table 2) , which suggests that studies producing epidemiological estimates relying on a 100% viral test specificity assumption should test robustness of conclusions to small deviations from that assumption.\n"," For ϕ A , the probability that a prior-infected person's antibody test was positive, the MLE was 86% (75%-93%), similar to the test manufacturer's finding that 109 of 122 (89.3%) PCRpositive subjects were positive for antibodies [32] . Assuming ϕ A = 89.3% directly and optimizing the other 6 parameters produces a slightly better AIC than the full 7-parameter model ( Table 2 ). The manufacturer's results included only symptomatic subjects and were highly dependent on the number of days post-symptom onset at which the serological sample was taken. Because the symptom histories of the antibody-tested people in our data are largely uncertain, it is difficult to determine how consistent our result is with the manufacturer's data.\n"," The MLE for π A , the probability that an antibody-tested person with no prior infection tested negative for antibodies, was 99.3% (99.2%-99.5%), which is within the uncertainty range of the test manufacturer's estimate of 99.6% (99.0%-99.9%) based on 4 positive tests from 997 samples collected prior to September 2019 [32] . Models assuming the manufacturer's point specificity estimate of 99.6%, produced inferior AIC to the full model (Table 2) . When we ran our MLE under the assumption of perfect specificity (no false positives) for the antibody test (π A = 100%), the result for secondary attack rate reduced from 36% to 18%, which is closer to the crude estimate described in Section 3.1, and the results for community acquisition probability increased from 0.4% to 1.2% (Table 2) . Thus, our model suggests that allowing for false positives can shift the attribution of infections toward household transmissions and away from acquisitions outside the household. We also found that assuming perfect specificity of the antibody test dramatically reduced the estimate of ϕ V from 72% to 37% (Table 2) , which suggests that ignoring false positives in serology data could cause an underestimate of the case ascertainment rate if the serology data are used for that purpose.\n"," When optimizing the likelihood equation against 500 synthetic data sets simulated using the MLE variable assumptions, the median estimates of each parameter were very close to the MLE values ( Table 1 ). The confidence intervals derived from these bootstrap estimates were similar to those derived from the likelihood ratio test, though the bootstrap intervals were somewhat wider for the three parameters governing importation and transmission. Likewise, the likelihood ratio-based intervals reported in Table 1 expanded modestly when we calculated 2-dimensional confidence regions based on each pair of estimated parameters, with most regions exhibiting close to symmetric shapes around the MLE (Supplemental Figures in S1  File) . Notably, the 95% confidence regions involving the transmission dispersion parameter d h can extend to the high-variability boundary d h = 0, a result that is also reflected by the fact that the MLE for the model with fixed d h = 0 cannot be rejected with high confidence (P = 0.16) ( Table 2) . However, none of the alternate models assuming d h = 0 produced a superior AIC to the full model (Table 2 ).\n"," Our alternate model that employed a beta-binomial distribution for the number of household acquisitions, using a new dispersion parameter d c estimated as an additional variable in the MLE, found d c = 2.1 (0.89-7.5), with somewhat altered estimates of the other parameters (S4 Table in S1 File) compared to those in Table 1 . However, the log likelihood of the model in Table 1 , which is equivalent to the alternate model with d c = 1, is sufficiently close to that of the alternate model that d c = 1 cannot be rejected by the likelihood ratio test and neither model is favored by the Akaike information criterion. If overdispersion in household community acquisitions does occur, the uncertainty ranges of the transmission variables p h and d h become large (see Supplementary Results in S1 File).\n"," We quantified the implications of our key finding of high transmission variability within households of persons infected with COVID-19 by calculating the probability of transmission extremes. Compared to our overall MLE, the classic binomial transmission model (d h = 1) produced a similar average secondary attack rate estimate of p h = 32% (24%-41%). However, the binomial model produces substantially lower probabilities that an infected individual transmits to no one or everyone in larger households (Table 3) .\n"," For example, our MLE model estimates that an infected member of an 8-member household would have a 46% (22%-70%) chance of transmitting to no one, but a 20% (3%-50%) chance of transmitting infection directly to all 7 housemates. By contrast, the no-variability binomial model estimate would be substantially lower for each extreme: 7% (3%-14%) chance of transmitting to no one and 0.03% (0.005%-0.2%) chance of transmitting to everyone (Table 3) .\n"," We calculated an example of a dynamic transmission model that would produce the same mean and variance of a person's transmission probability to a household member that is produced by our MLE beta distribution. If an infected person's duration of infectiousness is assumed to be fixed and transmissibility to a housemate is modeled as a gamma distribution \n"," 45% (20%-70%) 5% (2%-11%) 20% (2%-50%) 0.01% (0.001%-0.08%) with shape k, then k = 0.18 (95% CI 0-0.7) when the mean and variance are matched, regardless of the infectious duration (Supplementary Methods in S1 File). This estimate of k is comparable to the dispersion parameter k of the negative binomial distribution commonly used to characterize overall variability in the number of transmissions from individuals, which can be derived from the Poisson distribution with a mean that is gamma-distributed with shape parameter k [17] . Our estimate of k is similar to point estimates for SARS-CoV-2 of k = 0.1 [22] , k = 0.25 [23] , and k = 0.33 [24] .\n"," Our estimate of the household reproduction number R h , the expected number of household transmissions from a community acquirer with no other infected fellow household members, depends on our estimate of p h and the mean μ and variance σ 2 of the household size distribution. From our data we found μ = 3.07 and σ 2 = 3.12, so our estimate is R h = 1.12 (0.78-1.56).\n"," Our estimate of the alternate household reproduction number R � h , the expected total number of transmissions in the household of a community acquirer, is R � h = 1.45 (0.94-2.05). The supercritical threshold for R c , the average number of non-household transmissions by an infected individual, is approximated by 1=ðR � h þ 1Þ (see Methods section 2.6 and S1 File). Using our estimate for R � h in Utah, this formula suggests that R c must be kept below approximately 0.41 (0.33-0.52) to avoid increasing growth of COVID-19 infections in the population.\n"," The key findings of our analyses stem from our simultaneous estimation of the average and variability of SARS-CoV-2 household transmission, household importation, and test data accuracy. Our novel combination of those interacting features within our model revealed two important epidemiological insights. First, we found that accounting for test error, especially the specificity of the serological antibody test, produced a substantially higher estimate for the household secondary attack rate. Second, we found evidence of substantial variability of transmissibility within households, which has important implications for understanding broad transmission patterns and mitigation strategies.\n"," An important implication of the first finding is that assuming perfect test accuracy may be a source of underestimation for the household secondary attack rate in other studies. Our maximum likelihood estimate was 35% (27%-48%), which is higher than recent pooled estimates of 17-19% from the most recent meta-analyses of worldwide household studies [7, 8] . These and other published studies have generally estimated the secondary attack rate by a simple calculation of the fraction of tests that were positive among household contacts of known cases. When we applied that calculation to our combined data, we found a crude secondary attack rate estimate of 15.6%. We traced the major source of this substantial underestimate to the assumption of perfect test specificity inherent in the crude formula.\n"," Our second major finding of overdispersion of household transmission stemmed from our use of the beta-binomial distribution to quantify the number of household transmissions from infected individuals. We quantified individual-level variability in transmissibility using a dispersion parameter d h , and the optimal value occurred at low dispersion (high variability; d h = 0.43). The more commonly used binomial model, a special case of our model at minimal variability (d h !1), was rejected, suggesting that transmission patterns are not well captured by that simplifying assumption.\n"," Our dispersion parameter estimate is not directly comparable to another commonly used dispersion parameter, often named k, that characterizes variability in the total number of transmissions (whether household or not) from each infected person as a parameter of the negative binomial distribution [17] . We converted d h to k in the context of simple model in which the only source of variability is a person's transmissibility per unit time in contact with others, finding k = 0.18, similar to other published results for SARS-CoV-2. This similarity perhaps suggests that variability in infectivity per time is a major driver of overall transmission variability for SARS-CoV-2. This could be consistent with findings that viral shedding is highly variable by individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections, both during asymptomatic and symptomatic phases of disease, suggesting that heterogeneous transmissibility may be largely explained by overdispersion in levels of viral shedding by individuals [33] . However, other studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 transmission overdispersion in the wider population beyond households may be less driven by biological heterogeneity and more by heterogeneous social contact behavior [34] .\n"," The level of within-household transmission variability captured by the parameter d h affects the contribution of household transmission toward threshold levels of overall transmission. Threshold conditions are often expressed using a reproduction number (R), the average number of transmissions from each infected person. The average number of household transmissions directly from an initially infected household member (R h ) is independent of d h , but d h does affect the average number of household transmissions in the next generation, i.e. by someone who acquired infection from a housemate. When transmission variability is higher, the household transmission potential of a household acquirer is lower, reducing to zero in the \"all-or-nothing\" limit d h = 0. To capture this effect, we introduced an alternate reproduction number R � h , which is the average number of total household transmissions after the initial introduction, when final household outbreak size has been reached.\n"," Neither R h >1 nor R � h > 1 are sufficient threshold conditions for sustained transmission in a community, which requires some level of between-household transmission to be maintained. Given our estimate of R � h = 1.45 (0.94-2.05), we can estimate the critical value of R c , the average number of non-household community transmission that would push transmission for the population above the supercritical threshold for a growing epidemic, with the threshold condition R c > 1=ðR � h þ 1Þ. Thus, we estimate that R c must be kept below approximately 0.41 (0.33-0.52) to avoid continued case growth in Utah if household transmission continues to be well characterized by our model. As this result depended on the average household size in our data, it is notable that Utah has the highest state-average household size in the United States. The average household size in Utah is 3.1, about 20% higher than the national average household size. Thus, our R h estimate may be high compared to other locations. A lower value of R h would lead to a higher threshold value for R c .The potential contribution of interventions to reduce household transmission may also be important. Using the terms defined above, if R c <1 but R c ðR � h þ 1Þ > 1, then overall transmission is above-threshold but could be pushed belowthreshold by reducing household transmission alone, such that R � h < 1=R c À 1. Methods to reduce household transmission might include increased used of at-home testing to earlier detect potential asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmitters, paired with increased use of masks, disinfectants, and/or distancing within homes of an infectious person [35] .\n"," This study has several limitations. Our estimate of high household transmission variability may not be robust to alternate assumptions for the way community acquisition risk varies by household. For example, some households could have been comprised of families with both parents working essential jobs during Spring/Summer 2020, with children attending in-person day care or camps, thus placing the entire household at much higher risk of community acquisition compared to households working / caring for children at home. Also, households could have high collective community acquisition probability via attending multi-household gatherings of extended family or other social groups. In these ways, households conceivably could vary considerably in their infection numbers for reasons that don't involve within-household transmission.\n"," We tested the implications of this alternate possibility for household variability in our model by allowing variability in community acquisition by household using an additional dispersion parameter to the MLE model (Supplementary Results in S1 File). Interestingly, the MLE for the transmission dispersion parameter d h still occurred at high variability in household transmission (d h = 0.21) under this alternate model. Furthermore, the improvement in likelihood was not substantial, such that the more complicated model would not be favored by the likelihood ratio test nor the Akaike information criterion. However, larger uncertainty ranges under the alternate model suggest that we may not be able to definitively rule out the possibility that variability in community acquisition risk by household plays a substantial role in explaining overall variability in household infection numbers.\n"," It is also possible that household transmission variability could be driven by properties of households such as contact behavior, underlying health composition of household members, physical properties of the domicile such as size and ventilation, or other properties that could increase transmission risk of all household members together. Possible variability in personto-person transmission probability by household, rather than by individual, is not accounted for in our model. Using a beta distribution for this probability across different households to arrive at an alternate final size distribution would require integrating the beta distribution over the full final size distribution equations produced by the binomial-chain model, which would be complicated for larger households. Alternatively, one could model a functional relationship between observed properties of a household in the dataset and its average transmission probability, while retaining dispersion occurring at the individual level. We have not attempted this with our data; we suspect that the sample size of outbreaks in households with a given feature would not be large enough to draw meaningful conclusions, but this could be an important direction of future work enhanced by a larger dataset.\n"," Another limitation lies in our potentially inaccurate assumptions used to quantify the probability of prior infections among those with missing data within participating households. Most non-participating individuals within participating households were children under 12, who were not offered antibody tests. Older participants could fill out surveys on behalf of children of any age, including reporting of prior positive tests, but participation in that option was low. Thus, our assumption that non-participants had equal community acquisition rates, susceptibility to acquisition from another household member, and transmissibility to other household members compared to study participants would be violated if children were substantially different from adults in one or more of those quantities. Our assumption is consistent with studies finding similar transmission rates to and from children compared to adults. In a study of COVID-19 clusters linked to day care centers within our study area in Utah [36] , 42% of the cases occurred in children, who represented 60% of the people with epidemiological contacts to the facilities. The infected children (median age 7) transmitted infection to at least 26% of their non-facility contacts, close to our household estimate. Another study found that children under 10 in China were as likely to be infected as adults [37] . However, other studies suggest that children may be less likely to acquire infection than adults [38] , and one study found very low household secondary attack from infected children in South Korea [39] . A study similar to ours found lower rates of importation and household acquisition among children aged 5-9 compared to older groups, although confidence intervals overlapped [15] . If substantial differences existed between children under 12 and our study participants, one or more of our estimates could be biased.\n"," In addition, many eligible participants older than 12 chose not to participate, either declining the serological antibody test only (but still filling out a survey) or declining to participate at all. Comparing full participants to survey-only participants, we found that participants reporting a prior positive SARS-CoV-2 test were less likely to agree to antibody testing, though the difference was not large (63.0% vs. 72.8%). It is unknown whether a prior confirmed or suspected infection affected eligible household members' decision to agree or decline to fill out a survey. The full set of surveyed participants had different distributions of reported age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, and education level compared to the wider population, and future work could assess the implications of those differences for extrapolating COVID-19 risk to other households.\n"," We also have not adjusted for potential biases related to non-participation rates of entire households that were selected and approached for inclusion in the study. Our data collection included a complicated sampling design across several different strata, and weights were introduced partly to account for different rates of nonresponse across the different strata. For simplicity we ignored these details and sampling weights for the analysis presented here. Also, while the 7 included Utah counties represent >86% of the state population, there may be important differences in households from the 22 excluded counties. Thus, households with higher COVID-19 risk may be overrepresented or underrepresented in our data relative to their frequency in the broader population of households in Utah.\n"," Other potential limitations due to simplifying assumptions could be addressed in future work by relaxing those assumptions, such as assuming different prior infection probabilities for those who reported prior negative tests vs. those who reported never being tested and including the probability of active infections at the time of serological testing. Although these potential limitations, which also exist for other analyses of household transmission from serological data [13] [14] [15] , remain in our analysis, we believe our model has addressed other limitations of existing models that may be more substantial. Our improvements to household secondary attack rate estimates, including factoring out non-household community acquisitions and tertiary transmissions, inclusion of overdispersion estimates, and careful consideration of the impact of imperfect test sensitivity and specificity, have produced improved insights into this important measure. While the likelihood equations resulting from our model are somewhat complicated, we have demonstrated that the complications introduced by including 7 unknown model parameters are justified by systematically comparing its performance against simpler models, using criteria that seek to balance goodness of fit with simplicity. Furthermore, we have provided full mathematical specification and computational code for reproducibility. The ability to explicitly calculate the likelihood for our model is an advantage for optimization speed and further mathematical analysis, and extensions to the epidemiological household model can readily be simulated to explore potential improvements.\n"," In conclusion, we found evidence of a relatively high secondary attack rate and high overdispersion in transmission of SARS-COV-2 in Utah households during a time when overall community prevalence was low. Other published household secondary attack rates may be underestimated without accounting for imperfect test sensitivity and specificity. Controllability of the virus may depend on mitigating transmission from a minority of highly infectious individuals in large households and other household-like locations where several people congregate indoors for extended periods.\n"," Supporting information S1 File.

hyorhinis adhesion to epithelial cells as well as a plasminogen receptor mediating extracellular matrix degradation\n","Body Text: The cell wall-less members of the Mycoplasma genus are commensal, opportunistic or pathogenic bacteria that can colonize in humans, animals and plants. Various Mycoplasma species are considered pathogenic to swine, including Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma suis and Mycoplasma hyosynoviae [1] . M. hyorhinis is ubiquitous in the pig population and can be found in the respiratory tract of both healthy animals and those showing clinical signs of M. hyorhinis infection. Most colonized pigs show no apparent clinical manifestation of disease. The occurrence of disease is often related to the systemic invasion of the pathogen. Clinical signs vary greatly from server polyserositis, arthritis and lameness, to mild otitis or conjunctivitis [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . In addition to being a pathogen of pigs, M. hyorhinis has also been reported to be linked with human cancer [2, 3] . M. hyorhinis has been detected in cancerous tissues from gastric, esophageal, lung, breast, glioma and colon cancers by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or immunohistochemical staining (IHC) [2] . Antibodies to M. hyorhinis, specifically targeted to the P37 protein, have also been found to bind circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [4, 5] .\n"," Adhesion factors play a vital role in the process of mycoplasma infection and pathogenicity. At present, there are very limited research reports on the adhesion factors of M. hyorhinis. To date, only two adhesion molecules have been identified, these include variable lipoprotein family (Vlp) [6] and the tumor-associated lipoprotein P37 [7] . However other adhesins, colonization factors and pathogenicity mechanisms are yet to be uncovered. As described for several other species of mycoplasma, many endogenous proteins are also expressed on the surface of the cell membrane due to unknown mechanism, and exert the function as adhesion molecules [8] [9] [10] [11] . Among them, the enzymes in the glycolysis pathway are the most common proteins. Due to the absence of a TCA cycle, mycoplasmas often, but not exclusively derive ATP from glycolysis. Its key enzymes such as enolase, GAPDH, fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase have all been reported to have cell adhesion functions and are processed on the cell surface [8, [12] [13] [14] [15] . In addition, these proteins are often found to bind the components of the ECM [16, 17] , extracellular actin [18] and plasminogen [13, 19, 20] .\n"," On the other hand, a variety of mycoplasmas, including M. hyorhinis, are invasive bacteria [21] [22] [23] . A common feature of invasive processes is the degradation of ECM or basement membrane (BM, specialized ECM), which is required for invasive cells to migrate into adjacent tissues or into circulation [24] . Various invasive bacterial pathogens express plasminogen receptors (PlgR) that immobilize plasminogen on its surface. The bound plasminogen is converted to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and initiate a proteolytic cascade that leads to damage to these tissue barriers [24, 25] . Furthermore, bacterial adherence to ECM (including BM) initiated bacterial uptake via the endosomal pathway [26, 27] and directs bacteriuminduced proteolytic activity onto ECM, which facilitates bacterial dissemination through ECM [24, 28] .\n"," GAPDH, which catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-diphosphoglycerate, is a typical moonlighting enzyme. Surface expression and adhesive function have been confirmed for an increasing number of bacteria, including Streptococcus species [29] , Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae [30] , Lactobacillus reuteri [31] , Mycoplasma pneumoniae [12, 16, 32] . The GAPDH of M. pneumoniae has been proved to bind different types of human cells [12, 32] and interact with human plasminogen, vitronectin, fibronectin and fibrinogen [16, 32] . The role of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae GAPDH in adhesion was also strongly implicated by its interaction with actin and other cell-surface associated components [18] .\n"," In the present study, we identified the participation of M. hyorhinis GAPDH in cytoadherence to swine and human cells, interaction with ECM, and its role in hijacking plasminogen/plasmin system to degrade ECM components.\n"," M. hyorhinis strain HEF16 was isolated in our lab from a pig showing typical clinical signs, and grown in KM2 medium (Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China). Escherichia coli strains DH5α and BL21 (DE3) were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on solid media containing 1.5% agarose supplemented with 30 μg/ mL of kanamycin. The pET-28a ( +) expression vector was obtained from Novagen (Merck, Germany).\n"," PK15 cells, a porcine epithelial cell line derived from a normal pig kidney, and NCI-H292 cells, a human airway epithelial cell line derived from a pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS medium was used for cells culture. The cells were maintained in a humidified air with provision of 5% CO2.\n"," The entire GAPDH gene was generated synthetically based on the sequence of strain HUB-1(GenBank, CP002170.1). The sequence was optimized with E. colipreferred codons and two TGA codons were mutated into TGG. The gene was inserted into the pET-28a ( +) vector between the XhoI and BamHI cleavage sites. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21 by chemical transformation (BL21 Chemically Competent Cells, Sigma, USA), identified by PCR with T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers and verified by DNA sequencing (GenScript, China). E. coli cells at log phase were treated with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) with a final concentration of 1 mM for 6 h at 37 ℃ to induce expression. Recombinant protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography (GenScript, China), dialyzed, freeze-dried and stored at −80 °C before use. Protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). For identification, whole cell lysate of E. coli BL21 carrying recombinant vector pET-28a-gapdh before and after induction by IPTG and purified rGAPDH protein were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBST buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20), the membrane was incubated with mouse anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Boster, China), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000, Boster, China). Finally, filters were developed with Electro-Chemi-Luminescence (ECL) substrate using a ChemiDoc XRS + system (Bio-Rad, USA).\n"," Polyclonal antibodies were raised against rGAPDH by subcutaneously immunizing two 1-month-old New Zealand White rabbits which were obtained from a contract farm. Each rabbit was immunized three times with 1 mg of rGAPDH emulsified in Freund's adjuvant (1:1, v/v, Sigma, USA) at 2-week intervals. Antisera were collected at 1 week after the third immunization, and titers were determined by ELISA. The reactivity and specificity of the prepared polyclonal antibody was assessed by Western blotting (Additional file 1).\n"," Flow cytometry analysis was used to detect if GAPDH was located on the surface of M. hyorhinis. In brief, M. hyorhinis (10 8 color change unit (CCU)) were incubated with anti-rGAPDH serum at a 1:100 dilution (preimmune rabbit serum was used as negative control) for 1 h at 37 °C. The blank control was incubated with PBS instead of antibody. M. hyorhinis cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:500 dilutions (Boster, China) for 1 h at 37 °C. The fluorescence intensity was detected using flow cytometer (BD Accuri ® C6). The level of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of M. hyorhinis incubated with anti-rGAPDH serum was expressed as the percentage of that incubated with preimmune serum.\n"," Alternatively, the colony blot technique was used to detect if GAPDH displayed at the surface of M. hyorhinis colonies. PVDF membranes were gently placed on mycoplasma colonies on the surface of agar plates.\n"," After 5 min, filters were removed, blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with TBST buffer containing 5% skim milk, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBST containing 5% skim milk and anti-rGAPDH serum (1:1000 dilution). Filters were washed four times with TBST with an interval of 15 min and treated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10 000; Boster, China) for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, filters were developed with ECL substrate using the ChemiDoc XRS + system. Preimmune serum was used as a negative control instead of anti-rGAPDH serum.\n"," Binding ability of rGAPDH to human and swine airway epithelial cells PK-15 or NCI-H292 cells were propagated in a 96-well cell plates for 24-36 h. The original medium was removed, and 100 μg of rGAPDH in medium was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h after washing the cells thrice with PBS. Cells incubated with BSA were used as control. Unbound proteins were washed with PBS. The cells were then fixed with cold ethanol for 30 min at 4 °C, and blocked with PBS containing 5% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. The adherence was evaluated by adding anti-rGAPDH monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) followed by Cy3conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Beyotime Biotechnology, China). The cell nuclei were stained with Hoechest 33,342 (Beyotime Biotechnology, China).

For this, cell membrane proteins were prepared by a commercial Membrane and Cytosol Protein Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tiangen Biotech, China). A flat-bottom 96-well ELISA plate was coated with 100 μL cell membrane protein (10 μg/mL) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 5% BSA, the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μL of different concentrations (from 1.5 to 100 μg/mL) of rGAPDH protein. PBS was used as control. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with PBST, and the adherence were evaluated by adding 100 μL of mouse anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody (1:5000), followed by 100 μL of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10 000). After washing, the substrate containing 3,3' ,5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine and H 2 O 2 -urea was added and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, H 2 SO 4 was added to stop the reaction, absorbance was measured at 450 nm. For the adherence inhibition assay, 50 μg/mL of rGAPDH was mixed rabbit anti-rGAPDH serum (1:100 dilution) and added into the microtiter plate. Experiments were performed in triplicate.\n"," Mycoplasma hyorhinis cells (1 × 10 7 CCU/mL) were washed three times with PBS and pre-incubated with polyclonal antibody raised against rGAPDH or preimmune sera (1:100 dilution) at 37 °C for 30 min. Bacteria suspended in RPMI-1640 medium were added to 96-well cell plates containing confluent PK-15 or NCI-H292 cells and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. After washing with PBS to remove nonadherent mycoplasmas, the cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min, and the CCU of mycoplasma were determined. The sample solution (100 μL) was added into 900 μL of medium, the serial ten-fold dilutions were made until a dilution of 10 -11 was achieved. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 14 days. The highest dilution at which color changes was detected and recorded in CCU/mL. Experiments were performed in triplicate.\n"," ELISA and Far-Western blotting were used to determine the binding ability of rGAPDH to plasminogen. For ELISA, 96-well micro titer plates were coated with 100 μL rGAPDH solution (30 μg/mL) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 5% BSA, the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μL of human plasminogen (10 μg/mL, Sigma, USA) or BSA. After washing with PBST, binding properties were determined by incubating with rabbit anti-plasminogen polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution; Boster, China) followed by HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:10 000 dilution). After washing, the substrate was added and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm.\n"," For Far-Western blotting, a 20 μg sample of rGAPDH was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk, the membrane was incubated with 10 μg/mL plasminogen, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-plasminogen polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) as the primary antibody, and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10 000 dilution) as the secondary antibody. Finally, the membrane was developed with ECL as described above. BSA was used as negative control.\n"," The 96-well micro titers plates were coated with 100 μL rGAPDH solution (30 μg/mL) overnight at 4 ℃. After blocking with 5% BSA, the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μL of human plasminogen (5 μg/mL, Sigma, USA) in the presence or absence of 200 mM lysine analogue, ε-aminocaproic acid (ε-ACA, Sigma, USA). After washing with PBS, 100 μL of tPA (200 ng/ mL, Sigma, USA) was added and the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The plasmin-specific substrate D-valylleucyl-lysine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride (Sigma, USA) was added at a final concentration of 0.4 mM. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and absorbance was read at 405 nm.\n"," To visualize the ECM degradation by scanning electron microscope, the rGAPDH harboring polystyrene beads were used. Conjugation of rGAPDH protein and BSA with polystyrene beads of 1.1 μm mean particle size (Sigma, USA) was performed essentially as described by the manufacturer using the passive absorption procedure. In brief, 20 μL beads were incubated with 1 mL of rGAPDH or BSA solution of 1.5 mg/mL overnight at 4 °C, followed by blocking with BSA (5%). The binding of rGAPDH was detected by anti-His-tag antibody (Data not shown). After washing with PBS, 10 μg/mL plasminogen was added and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by 200 ng/mL tPA. After washing, the beads were resuspended in 1 mL PBS. Matrigel was diluted in ice-cold PBS (1:3) and pipetted on 3-μm filters in Transwell cell culture chamber inserts (Corning, USA). The Matrigel (Corning, USA), a BM preparation from mouse tumor, was allowed to settle at 4 °C for 30 min and was then gelled at 37 °C overnight. The Matrigel was rehydrated in 70 uL PBS for 1 h at 37 °C before proceeding with the degradation assay. The resuspended beads of 70 uL were added into the upper compartment of the Transwell whereas the lower compartment contained 700 uL PBS. The chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 40 h. The filters were gently washed with PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and exanimated in a Zeiss EVO-LS10 scanning electron microscope (Zeiss, Germany).\n"," The 96-well micro titers plate were coated with 100 μL Matrigel, fibronectin, laminin, collagen IV, or BSA solution (10 μg/mL) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 5% BSA, the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 100 μL of rGAPDH protein (12.5-100 μg/mL) or BSA. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with PBST, and the adherence was evaluated by adding 100 μL of mouse anti-His-tag monoclonal antibodies (1:1000), followed by 100 μL of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10 000). After washing, the substrate was added and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The ELISA system was inverted for detecting the binding of rGAPDH to recombinant vitronectin (containing His-tag). rGAPDH or BSA protein of 10 μg/mL were coated, and then vitronectin (1.25-5 μg/mL) were added. The bound vitronectin was detected by rabbit anti-vitronectin monoclonal antibody (1:2000; Boster, China), followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10 000).\n"," Statistical difference was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. The P-values < 0.05 (*) were considered as statistically significant.\n"," The GAPDH gene is very conserved among different strains of M. hyorhinis. Full-length of GAPDH gene, designed based on the genome sequence of strain HUB-1, was synthesized and cloned into the expression vector pET-28a ( +). The rGAPDH expressed in E. coli BL21 in soluble form was induced by IPTG and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The purified rGAPDH was detected by SDS-PAGE as a band around 40 kDa, which corresponds to the size of GAPDH with a His tag ( Figure 1A, lane 3) . The rGAPDH was further identified by Western blotting with anti-His antibody ( Figure 1B , lane 3). Anti-rGAPDH polyclonal antibody was prepared using the purified rGAPDH protein, with a titer of 1: 204 800 detected by ELISA. The antibody specifically reacted with the GAPDH of M. hyorhinis (Additional file 1).\n"," To investigate the cell surface localization of GAPDH on M. hyorhinis, two approaches were used. A flow cytometry analysis showed a significantly higher fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the M. hyorhinis incubated with anti-rGAPDH serum than the M. hyorhinis incubated with the negative serum of the corresponding rabbits (Figure 2A) , which indicated that the surface GAPDH was accessible to the GAPDH-specific antibody. To further confirm the surface localization of GAPDH, colony blot analysis was carried out with agar cultures incubated with anti-rGAPDH serum. The corresponding pre-immune serum was used as the negative control. The anti-rGAPDH serum reacted strongly with the M. hyorhinis colonies, whereas no signals were obtained after incubating with the negative serum ( Figure 2B ).\n"," rGAPDH protein was analyzed for adherence to swine PK15 cells and human NCI-H292 cells. The direct adhesion of rGAPDH to the cells was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 3 , 100 μg of the rGAPDH indicated with red fluorescence significantly adhered to PK-15 and NCI-H292 cells (Figures 3A and C). No adherence was observed for the BSA control ( Figures 3B and D) . For adherence quantification, binding activity of the rGAPDH protein to the cells was assessed by micro titer plate adhesion assay (MPAA). Various dilutions of the rGAPDH solution were added to ELISA wells coated with cell membrane proteins. As shown in Figure 4A , the rGAPDH bound to PK-15 cell membrane proteins in a dose-dependent manner from 3 μg/mL to 100 μg/mL (P < 0.01). A similar pattern was observed when plates were coated with NCI-H292 cell membrane proteins ( Figure 4C ), from 3 μg/ mL to 100 μg/mL (P < 0.01). The binding was inhibited by using antiserum against rGAPDH, but not the negative serum (Figures 4B and D) . \n"," Antibody inhibition assay was performed to further confirm the function of surface-exposed GAPDH in cytoadhesion of M. hyorhinis. The number of M. hyorhinis attached to PK15 Figure 5A ) and NCI-H292 ( Figure 5B ) cells were greatly reduced after being incubated with anti-rGAPDH serum, compared with those of the M. hyorhinis incubated with negative serum (P < 0.01). It was confirmed that surface-localized GAPDH plays an indispensable role in adherence of M. hyorhinis to host cells.\n"," First, ELISA was used to define the ability of rGAPDH to bind plasminogen. Plasminogen was added into the micro titer plates coated with rGAPDH or BSA. After washing, bound plasminogen was detected with polyclonal anti-plasminogen. As shown in Figure 6A , the wells coated with rGAPDH shown significantly increased OD450nm values than those of the wells coated with BSA (P < 0.05), indicating a binding between rGAPDH and plasminogen. To further characterize the specific interaction between GAPDH and plasminogen, Far-Western bolt analysis was conducted. After rGAPDH or BSA was transferred to PVDF membrane, plasminogen was added. After washing, bound plasminogen could be detected with anti-plasminogen antibody at the site corresponding to the band of purified rGAPDH ( Figure 6B ). No obvious interaction between plasminogen and BSA was observed.\n"," Plasminogen-plasmin system plays an important role in bacteria invasion. After confirmation of binding of rGAPDH to plasminogen, we further detected if rGAPDH-bound plasminogen could be activated to plasmin by the activator tPA. ELISA plates were coated with rGAPDH and blocked. After plasminogen and tPA were added successively, proteolytic activity was quantified using a plasmin-specific chromogenic substrate. As shown in Figure 6C , rGAPDH-bound plasminogen was converted to active plasmin by plasminogen activator tPA. The activity was detected with an OD 405 nm of 0.61, significantly higher than that of BSA-coated wells (P < 0.01) and that of wells in the presence of the lysine analogue, ε-ACA (P < 0.01), which not only indicated that rGAPDH-bound plasminogen can be activated but also hinted that plasminogen probably binds to rGAPDH through the lysine residues of the latter.\n"," ECM degradation is critical in the invasion process of bacteria. The basement membrane under the epithelial cells is assumed to be one of the most important physical barriers that restrict M. hyorhinis from breaking through the respiratory tract. We further performed the proteolytic activity test on Matrigel, a complex ECM preparation composed of laminin, type IV collagen, heparansulfate proteoglycan, etc. Basement membrane was reconstituted by Matrigel on the 3-μm filters in Transwell cell culture chamber inserts. rGAPDH or BSAcoated polystyrene beads treated with plasminogen and tPA were added. The degradation of reconstituted basement membrane was analyzed by electron microscopy. The structure of the reconstituted basement membrane is shown in Figure 7 . With the supplementation of plasminogen and tPA, no degradation was observed for the BSA-coated beads (Figures 7C, D) . While significant damage of the reconstituted basement membrane, forming depressions emerged in the in vitro model of ECM membrane treated with rGAPDH-coated beads. The holes in the filter membrane were exposed in some area, where the beads can fall into ( Figures 7A, B) .\n"," ECM components are common host proteins that interact with mycoplasmas. The combination of mycoplasmas to ECM facilitates the subsequent degradation. Here, we evaluated the interaction between rGAPDH and different ECM components to further study which component of ECM is the main receptor for GAPDH binding. By coating Matrigel, fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type IV on micro titer plates (the system was inverted for detecting the binding of rGAPDH to recombinant vitronectin by coating rGAPDH on wells), concentration-dependent binding of rGAPDH to Matrigel and all of the four ECM components were observed (P < 0.01). The binding of rGAPDH with ECM is multiple guaranteed (Figure 8 ).\n"," Mycoplasma hyorhinis is commonly found in pigs, especially in the respiratory tract. The occurrence of disease is often related to the systemic invasion of the pathogen. M. hyorhinis has also been detected in a variety of human tumor tissues, such as gastric, esophageal, lung, breast, glioma and colon cancers [2] . Adhesion to the host cell is the first step in many mycoplasmas infection. Most mycoplasmas lack the classical bacterial toxins; therefore, adhesion molecules are considered to be important virulence-related factors for mycoplasmas, and are often regarded as the main candidate antigens for vaccine development. To date, the Vlp family and P37 proteins are the well-known identified adhesins of M. hyorhinis, the cytoadhesive function of which have been proven in swine respiratory epithelium cells [6] and human gastric cancer cells [7] . However, the pathogenesis and possible virulence factors of M. hyorhinis are not yet fully known, and the exact mechanism by which it adheres to epithelial cells remain to be understood. In the present study, we demonstrated a novel adhesin of M. hyorhinis, GAPDH. GAPDH is originally one of the key canonical glycolytic enzymes, which functions in the cytoplasm. However, it can also be present at the surface of some pathogens, where it plays other roles, including acting as an adhesion molecule, although it lacks special extracellular targeting motifs [29] [30] [31] . The surface location and cytoadhesion function of GAPDH have been reported in three Mycoplasma species, M. pneumoniae [12, 32] , M. hyopneumoniae [18] and Mycoplasma suis [33, 34] . The present study focuses on GAPDH's role as a non-canonical adhesin in M. hyorhinis. The cell-surface display of GAPDH in M. hyorhinis was determined by flow cytometry and colony blot analyses. This suggested that GAPDH has the possibility to interact directly with host cells or components. Furthermore, we demonstrated the adhesion of the GAPDH of M. hyorhinis to two commonly used cell lines, porcine-derived PK-15 cells and humanderived NCI-H292 cells by recombinant protein adhesion and antibody inhibition tests. The data indicated that the GAPDH moonlights as an adhesin on the M. hyorhinis Figure 6 Binding activity of the rGAPDH protein to plasminogen and the activation of the rGAPDH-bound plasminogen to plasmin. A ELISA was performed to characterize the ability of immobilized rGAPDH binding plasminogen. B Far Western blot analysis of binding activity of rGAPDH to plasminogen. Bound plasminogen was determined by anti-plasminogen antibody. BSA was chosen as negative control for non-specific binding. C Plasminogen bound to the coated rGAPDH in microtiters plate was activated to plasmin by tPA. The presence of lysine analogue, ε-ACA decreased the binding of plasminogen to rGAPDH. Activity of plasmin was evaluated by adding chromogenic substrate, and OD405nm was measured. Data are expressed as mean ± SD of at least three experiments with samples in triplicate. **P < 0.01.\n"," surface. However, in the competitive adhesion inhibition assay, only partial inhibition of GAPDH was observed. Since several other proteins, such as P37 and Vlp have also been verified to contribute to the adhesion process of M. hyorhinis, it can be speculated that when GAPDH is blocked, the adhesion of M. hyorhinis still partly exists.\n"," Mycoplasma hyorhinis is considered to be commensal, colonizing the tonsils and respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity and conducting airways. The occurrence of disease is often related to the systemic invasion of M. hyorhinis. In addition to tonsil, nasal cavity and lung, M. hyorhinis could also be detected or recovered from a variety of other tissues from the infected pigs with clinical symptoms, including heart, pericardium, peritoneum, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, affected joints, spleen, liver, inguinal node, and even from central nervous system [23, [35] [36] [37] [38] . The detection of bacterium in samples collected from affected joints and/or serous membranes is generally required for accurate diagnosis [1] . However, the mechanism of its dissemination is unknown. The plasminogen/plasmin system of the host plays a significant role in several physiological processes, such as degradation of fibrin clots in fibrinolysis and various ECM and connective tissue components, such as laminin and fibronectin [39, 40] . Many bacteria interact with the plasminogen/plasmin system by secreting PAs or, more commonly, by expressing PlgRs on their surface. Binding of plasminogen to bacterial PlgR enhances plasminogen activation by host PAs, and the bacteria consequently turn themselves into proteolytic organisms using the host-derived system [24, 25] . The ability to degrade tissue barriers formed by the ECM, leading to tissue and structure damage, is one of the most important factors in bacterial invasiveness of the host body. Bacteria usually employ multifunctional, highly conserved proteins to capture plasminogen. Members of the glycolytic pathway, chaperones, and other metabolic enzymes have been identified as plasminogen-binding proteins from diverse bacteria [41] . Enolase, a key glycolytic enzyme, is one of the most well-known PlgRs [42, 43] . In addition, GAPDH is another widely studied PlgR. Its plasminogen binding function has been reported in many bacteria, such as streptococci [44, 45] , Escherichia coli [46] , Clostridium perfringens [47] , and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae [30] as well as certain parasites, such as Babesia microti [48] and Dirofilaria immitis [49] , and even mammalian cells [50] . Among Mycoplasma species, the GAPDH of M. pneumoniae is the most studied. Different reports have confirmed that M. pneumoniae GAPDH can bind to plasminogen [12, 16, 20, 32] . However, the activity of the converted plasmin, especially its ability to degrade the ECM, was not significant or consistent in most of the published studies [16, 20] . In the present study, we demonstrated that rGAPDH of M. hyorhinis could bind plasminogen, and the bound plasminogen could be activated by tPA to form the active serine protease plasmin and degrade specific substrates. The binding and activity were markedly inhibited by adding εACA enriched in lysine, indicating the critical role of lysine residues in the interaction between GAPDH and plasminogen. The activity of produced plasmin was further demonstrated using Matrigel degradation analysis. These results indicated the role of the surface located GAPDH as a PlgR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of reconstituted ECM degradation by plasmin in the presence of GAPDH of mycoplasma. Systemic infection is critical for M. hyorhinis to cause disease; therefore, the adhesion molecules that also participate in the plasminogen/plasmin system activation should have more potential as subunit vaccine antigens.\n"," According to current reports, M. hyorhinis has been detected in a variety of tumor tissues, such as gastric cancer and prostate cancer [5, 6] . It is likely that it would disseminate in the human body to form a systemic infection, as it does in pigs [1, 23, 35-38,] , and the exploitation of the plasminogen/plasmin system might also participate in its infection in humans. On the other hand, dysregulation of the plasminogen/ plasmin system is also involved in tumor growth and metastasis formation [51, 52] . Indeed, overexpression of PlgRs, including actin, enolase-1, cytokeratin 8, and annexin II-S100A10, has been associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy in patients with cancer [53] . A number of experiments have shown that M. hyorhinis infection can induce a variety of tumor cells to increase their migration and invasiveness in vitro [54] [55] [56] . Some explanations have been proposed, including the key function of P37 [57, 58] ; however, the precise mechanism by which P37 functions remains unknown. A preliminary test has been carried out, which showed that the amount of plasminogen bound to the surface of M. hyorhinis-infected NCI-H292 cells was higher than that of the uninfected cells [data not shown]. This suggested that M. hyorhinis might act as a bridge to enhance the ability of tumor cells to capture plasminogen to their surface, thereby affecting the subsequent tumor development process.\n"," In addition to binding plasminogen, GAPDH has a variety of other binding activities. The GAPDHs of Clostridium perfringens [47] and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae [30] can also bind to fibronectin. The interaction between M. pneumoniae GAPDH and different ECM components [16, 32] , as well as the interaction between Mycoplasma genitalium GAPDH and mucin [59] , have also been reported. Here, we demonstrated the interaction between rGAPDH of M. hyorhinis and fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV, and vitronectin. Speculatively, in the process of infection, M. hyorhinis first uses adhesion factors such as GAPDH to bind the ECM, facilitating adhesion and colonization. It then recruits plasminogen, and uses activated plasmin to degrade the ECM to help it spread through tissue barriers. The characteristic of one receptor binding to multiple host molecules could help to efficiently direct the plasmin activity to locations where proteolytic activity is required.\n"," GAPDH is a conserved house-keeping enzyme. Among the Mycoplasma species that infect swine, the amino acid sequence identity of the GAPDH protein of M. hyorhinis, M. hyopneumoniae, and Mycoplasma flocculare is above 73%, and the identity between M. hyorhinis and Mycoplasma hyosynoviae is 58.51%. The surface exposure of the GAPDH protein of M. hyopneumoniae, as well as its ability to bind actin, fibronectin, heparin and plasminogen, have been reported [18] . Recently, we demonstrated the hydrolytic activity of its bound plasminogen after activation (non-published results). We speculated that these functions of GAPDH might be universal in swine mycoplasmas.\n"," Present study demonstrated that GAPDH acts as a surface adhesin in M. hyorhinis adhesion to porcine PK-15 cell and human NCI-H292 cell. It also acts as a receptor in the interaction between M. hyorhinis and plasminogen. The activation of the rGAPDH-bound plasminogen has been demonstrated, which resulted in ECM degradation. The binding of rGAPDH to different ECM components has also been proved, and it could help to direct the plasmin activity to locations required. Possible lysine residues binding sites were raised in this study which was worthy to be studied further.\n","Score: 3.5936638891465544\n","\n","Title: Supplementary appendix Supplementary information Materials and methods\n","Body Text: density gradient (densities 1.089 and 1.040 g/ml) and centrifuged at 25×g for 20 min without brake.\n"," The cell layer at the interface of the two gradients was collected and washed four times with BSS to remove the Percoll.

[1] [2] [3] Among them, SARS-CoV was first reported in Guangdong, China in 2002. 4 SARS-CoV caused human-to-human transmission and resulted in the 2003 outbreak with about 10% case fatality rate (CFR), 1 while MERS-CoV was reported in Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 5 Even though with its limited human-tohuman transmission, MERS-CoV showed a CFR of about 34.4%. 2 The 2019-nCoV was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 from patients with pneumonia, 6 and it has exceeded both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in its rate of transmission among humans. 7 2019-nCoV was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), 8 while it was renamed HCoV-19, as a common virus name, by a group of virologists in China. 9 The disease and the virus causing it were named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) and the virus responsible for COVID-19 or the COVID-19 virus, respectively, by WHO. 3 As of March 5, 2020, a total of 95,333 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported, including 3,282 deaths, in China and at least 85 other countries and/or territories. 7 Currently, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown, and no effective prophylactics or therapeutics are available. This calls for the immediate development of vaccines and antiviral drugs for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.\n"," A coronavirus contains four structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. 2, 10, 11 Among them, S protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and it serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. 1, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The S protein mediates viral entry into host cells by first binding to a host receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit and then fusing the viral and host membranes through the S2 subunit. 16, 18, 19 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBDs recognize different receptors. SARS-CoV recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor, whereas MERS-CoV recognizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as its receptor. 20, 21 Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also recognizes ACE2 as its host receptor binding to viral S protein. 22 Therefore, it is critical to define the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 S protein as the most likely target for the development of virus attachment inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and vaccines.\n"," In this study, we identified the RBD fragment in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the recombinant RBD protein bound strongly to human ACE2 (hACE2) and bat ACE2 (bACE2) receptors. In addition, it blocked the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV into their respective hACE2-expressing cells, suggesting that it may serve as a viral attachment inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV RBDspecific polyclonal antibodies cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry into hACE2-expressing cells. We have also shown that SARS-CoV RBD-specific polyclonal antibodies could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccine for prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.\n"," By alignment of the RBD sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we identified the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD at residues 331 to 524 of S protein (Fig. 1a) . We then constructed a recombinant RBD protein containing codon-optimized RBD sequences with a Cterminal Fc of human IgG1 (hFc) using pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 expression vector, expressed the protein in mammalian cell 293T, and purified it from cell culture supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBD protein controls, SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein had high expression with strong purity (Fig. 1b) . Notably, only SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs were recognized by SARS-CoV RBD-specific, but not MERS-CoV RBD-specific, polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1c) , whereas only MERS-CoV RBD was recognized by MERS-CoV RBD-immunized polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1d ), suggesting the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein.\n"," Four experiments were performed to detect the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 receptor. First, we tested if stably transfected hACE2/293T cells expressed hACE2 by flow cytometry analysis. Since 293T cells alone did not express either hACE2 or hDPP4, they could not be recognized by anti-hACE2 or anti-hDPP4 antibodies ( Fig. 2a (left panel) ). Only hACE2/293T cells, but not hDPP4/293T cells, expressed hACE2, which was recognized by an anti-hACE2 antibody ( Fig. 2a (middle panel) ), whereas only hDPP4/293T cells, but not hACE2/293T cells, expressed hDPP4 and was, correspondingly, recognized by an anti-hDPP4 antibody ( Fig. 2a (right panel) ). These data confirmed the expression of hACE2 in hACE2/293T cells and the expression of hDPP4 in hDPP4/293T cells. Second, we used these hACE2/ 293T cells to detect the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein to cellassociated hACE2 by flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Similar to SARS-CoV RBD, SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to hACE2/293T cells expressing hACE2 (Fig. 2b (left and middle panels)), but not to hDPP4/293T cells expressing hDPP4 ( Fig. 2c (left and middle panels) ). Furthermore, the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2-expressing 293T cells was much stronger than the binding between SARS-CoV RBD and hACE2-expressing 293T cells (Fig. 2b (left and middle panels) ). MERS-CoV RBD did not bind to hACE2-expressing 293T cells ( Fig. 2b (right panel) ), but rather bound to hDPP4-expressing 293T cells (Fig. 2c (right panel) ). The results from immunofluorescence staining revealed positive signals for both hACE2 and hFc on hACE2/293T cells treated with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD, both of which contained a C-terminal hFc tag, whereas hACE2/293T cells treated with MERS-CoV RBD (containing a Cterminal hFc tag) showed positive signals for hACE2, but not for hFc, indicating that there is no binding of MERS-CoV RBD to the 4) . b, c Flow cytometry analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to cell-associated hACE2 receptor in hACE2/293T stable cell lines. SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein bound strongly to hACE2/293T cells (b (left panel, red line)), but not to hDPP4/293T cells (c (left panel, violet line)). SARS-CoV RBD protein bound to hACE2/293T cells (b (middle panel, red line)), but not to hDPP4/293T cells (c (middle panel, violet line)). MERS-CoV RBD protein did not bind to hACE2/293T cells (b (right panel, red line)), but rather bound to hDPP4/293T cells (c (right panel, violet line)). Human IgG Fc (hIgG-Fc, hereinafter hFc) protein-incubated cells (blue line) and mock-incubated cells (gray shading) were included as controls (b, c). Representative images and MFI ± s.e.m. were shown (n = 4). d Immunofluorescence detection of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to cell-associated hACE2 receptor in hACE2/293T cells. SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (green) and SARS-CoV RBD protein (green), each of which was fused with a C-terminal hFc, were stained with FITC-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody (1:500). hACE2 was stained with a goat-anti-hACE2 antibody (5 μg/ml) and Alexa-Fluor 647-labeled anti-goat antibody (red) (1:200). Fc-fused MERS-CoV RBD protein did not bind to hACE2, so only hACE2 (red), but not RBD (green), was detected in hACE2/293T cells. Nuclei were stained with 4' ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). Scale bar: 10 μm. Representative images are shown. e Detection of dose-dependent binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein to soluble hACE2 (sACE2) receptor by ELISA. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to soluble hDPP4 (sDPP4) receptor (f), and the binding of both SARS-CoV RBD and MERS-CoV RBD proteins to sACE2 (e), or sDPP4 (f), were tested. Control: hFc protein. Data are presented as mean A450 ± s.e.m. (n = 4). 50% effective dose (EC 50 ) was calculated for the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD (black) or SARS-CoV RBD (red) and hACE2 protein (e, sACE2), or the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and hDPP4 protein (sDPP4, green) (f). g-i Flow cytometry analysis of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein binding to hACE2/293T cells by sACE2. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to hACE2/293T cells (g, h, green line) was blocked by sACE2 (g, black line), but not by sDPP4 (h, red line). hFc protein-incubated cells (blue line) and mock-incubated cells (gray shading) were included as controls (g, h). Representative images are shown. i The blocking ability of sACE2 or sDPP4, as described above, was expressed as MFI ± s.e.m. (n = 4). Low MFI correlates with high blockage. Experiments were repeated twice and yielded similar results hACE2-expressing cells (Fig. 2d) . These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD can bind to cell-associated hACE2, but not to hDPP4. Third, we detected the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to soluble hACE2 protein (sACE2) by ELISA. The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to sACE2 in a dosedependent manner and that the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and sACE2 with 50% effective dose (EC 50 ) of 1.07 μg/ml was stronger than that between SARS-CoV RBD and sACE2 (EC 50 : 1.66 μg/ml). In contrast, MERS-CoV RBD did not bind to sACE2 (Fig. 2e) . While neither SARS-CoV-2 RBD nor SARS-CoV RBD bound to sDPP4, MERS-CoV RBD strongly bound to sDPP4 (EC 50 : 0.92 μg/ml) (Fig. 2f) . These data suggest that both SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD could bind to hACE2 in solution, but not to hDPP4 in solution. Fourth, flow cytometry analysis further indicated that the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and cell-associated hACE2 receptor could be significantly blocked by sACE2 protein (Fig. 2g , i), but not by sDPP4 protein (Fig. 2h, i) . Taken together, the above results confirm that the identified SARS-CoV-2 RBD could bind to both cell-associated and soluble hACE2 proteins.\n"," Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also originates from bats. [22] [23] [24] Next, we detected the binding affinity of the identified SARS-CoV-2 RBD to bat ACE2 (bACE2) and compared this binding with that of SARS-CoV RBD. We transiently transfected a bACE2expressing plasmid into 293T cells and included a hACE2expressing plasmid as a control, followed by detection of fluorescence intensity 48 h later. Results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound strongly to 293T-expressed bACE2 with intensity similar to that of its binding to 293T-expressed hACE2 (Fig. 3a, c) , and that this binding occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3e, f) . In addition, the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 293T-expressed bACE2 (EC 50 : 0.08 μg/ml) or hACE2 (EC 50 : 0.14 μg/ml) was significantly higher than that between SARS-CoV RBD and 293T-expressed bACE2 (EC 50 : 0.96 μg/ml) or hACE2 (EC 50 : 1.32 μg/ml) (Fig. 3b, d-f ). Nevertheless, MERS-CoV RBD bound neither bACE2-nor hACE2-expressing 293T cells (Fig. 3) . These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RBD can bind to both bACE2 and hACE2 with significantly stronger binding than that of SARS-CoV RBD to either bACE2 or hACE2, supporting the bat origin of SARS-CoV-2. These results may partially explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than SARS-CoV.\n"," We then evaluated the potential of the identified SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein as an inhibitor of viral entry. To accomplish this, we first generated a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 by cotransfection of a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and a plasmid expressing S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into 293T cells, followed by collection of pseudovirus-containing supernatants. We then incubated serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein with hACE2/293T target cells, followed by the addition of pseudovirus and detection of inhibitory activity of infection. With the capacity for only one-cycle infection, S protein-expressing pseudovirus cannot replicate in the target cells. 25, 26 Therefore, the inhibition of pseudovirus infection represents inhibition of viral entry, as mediated by viral S protein. As expected, SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into hACE2expressing 293T cells in a dose-dependent manner with 50% inhibition concentration (IC 50 ) as low as 1.35 µg/ml. Interestingly, it also blocked the entry of SARS-CoV pseudovirus into hACE2expressing 293T cells with IC 50 of 5.47 µg/ml (Fig. 4a) . Similarly, SARS-CoV RBD protein blocked the entry of both SARS-CoV pseudovirus and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into hACE2-expressing 293T cells with IC 50 of 4.1 and 11.63 µg/ml, respectively (Fig. 4b) .\n"," In addition, neither SARS-CoV-2 RBD nor SARS-CoV RBD blocked the entry of MERS-CoV pseudovirus into hDPP4-expressing 293T cells (Fig. 4c) . MERS-CoV RBD did not block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus or SARS-CoV pseudovirus into hACE2-expressing 293T cells, but it did block the entry of MERS-CoV pseudovirus into hDPP4-expressing 293T cells (IC 50 : 22.25 µg/ml) (Fig. 4a-c) .\n"," These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein could be developed as an effective therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.\n"," Since SARS-CoV-2 is more phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, 22 we further detected the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and crossneutralizing activity of SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. First, we performed an ELISA to detect the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV RBD-immunized mouse sera with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 RBD reacted strongly with anti-SARS-CoV RBD IgG with antibody titer of 1:2.4 × 10 4 (Fig. 4d) , but it did not react with anti-MERS-CoV RBD IgG (Fig. 4e) . As expected, SARS-CoV RBD reacted strongly with anti-SARS-CoV RBD IgG (antibody titer: 1:1.4 × 10 5 ) (Fig. 4d ), but not with anti-MERS-CoV RBD IgG (Fig. 4e) . MERS-CoV RBD did not react with anti-SARS-CoV RBD IgG (Fig. 4d) , but instead reacted with anti-MERS-CoV RBD IgG (antibody titer: 1:1.3 × 10 5 ) (Fig. 4e) . Second, we performed a pseudovirus neutralization assay to detect the cross-neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV RBD-immunized mouse sera against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Results revealed that SARS-CoV RBD-specific antisera could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection with a neutralizing antibody titer of 1:323, while these antisera could neutralize SARS-CoV pseudovirus infection with higher neutralizing antibody titer (1:1.2 × 10 4 ) (Fig. 4f) . MERS-CoV RBD-inducing mouse sera only neutralized MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection in hDPP4-expressing cells with a neutralizing antibody titer of 1:4 × 10 4 (Fig. 4g) , but failed to neutralize infection by either SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus or SARS-CoV pseudovirus (Fig. 4f) . These data suggest that SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection.\n"," In summary, we have characterized the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein which exhibits strong binding to its cell-associated and soluble ACE2 receptors with human and bat origin. This RBD protein also demonstrated significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 than SARS-CoV RBD. SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein could block S proteinmediated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and SARS-CoV pseudovirus entry into their respective ACE2 receptor-expressing target cells, suggesting the potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein as a viral attachment or entry inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV RBD-induced antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, indicating that SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies may be used for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and that either SARS-CoV RBD protein or SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein may be used as a candidate vaccine to induce cross-reactive or cross-neutralizing antibodies for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV infection. Taken together, this study provides an essential foundation for the design and development of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-based vaccines and therapeutics.\n"," The construction, expression, and purification of recombinant RBD proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV were performed as previously described with some modifications. 27, 28 Briefly, genes encoding residues 331-524 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, residues 318-510 of SARS-CoV S protein, or residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV S proteins, were amplified by PCR using codonoptimized SARS-CoV-2 S protein (GenBank accession number: QHR63250.1), SARS-CoV S protein (GenBank accession number: AY278488.2), or MERS-CoV S protein (GenBank accession number: AFS88936.1), as respective template, and fused into pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 expression vector (hereinafter named hFc; InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). The RBD proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells, secreted into cell culture supernatants, and purified by protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA).\n"," The purified RBD proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as previously described. 27, 29 Briefly, proteins were separated by 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% fat-free milk in PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST) for 2 h at 37°C and further incubated with SARS-CoV RBD-specific polyclonal antibody (mouse sera, 1:3,000), 30 or MERS-CoV RBD-specific antibody (mouse sera, 1:3,000), 31 overnight at 4°C. The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 1 h at room temperature and then visualized with ECL Western blot substrate reagents and Amersham Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare).\n"," Flow cytometry analysis Flow cytometry analysis was performed to detect the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein to hACE2 receptor in 293T cells stably expressing hACE2 (hACE2/293T). 26, 32 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBDs, as well as 293T cells stably expressing hDPP4 receptor (hDPP4/293T), were used as controls. Briefly, cells were incubated with respective RBD of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV containing a C-terminal hFc at 20 μg/ml for 30 min at room temperature, which was followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min and analyzed by flow cytometry. The blockage of RBDreceptor binding was performed by incubation of soluble human ACE2 (sACE2; 5 μg/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) receptor with respective RBD of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV (20 μg/ml), followed by the same procedure as that described above. hIgG-Fc protein (hFc: 20 μg/ml), or soluble human DPP4 (sDPP4; 5 μg/ml; R&D Systems) receptor, was included as control.\n"," Detection of hACE2 protein expression in hACE2/293T, or hDPP4 protein expression in hDPP4/293T, stable cell lines was performed by flow cytometry analysis, as described above, except that the cells were sequentially incubated with hACE2-or hDPP4specific goat antibody (0.5 μg/ml; R&D Systems) at room temperature for 20 min and FITC-labeled anti-goat IgG antibody (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for 1 h at 4°C.\n"," Flow cytometry analysis was also performed to detect the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2, or bat-ACE2 (bACE2), receptor in transiently transfected 293T cells. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with hACE2 or bACE2 plasmid using the calcium phosphate method, and 48 h later, they were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein at various concentrations for 30 min at room temperature. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBDs were included as controls. After staining with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific), the mixture was analyzed by flow cytometry as described above.\n"," Immunofluorescence staining This was performed to detect the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 receptor in hACE2/293T stable cell lines. 33 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBDs were used as controls. Briefly, cells were sequentially incubated with Fc-fused SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV RBD (20 μg/ml) and hACE2-specific goat antibody (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Fc) antibody (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific), or Alexa-Fluor 647labeled anti-goat antibody (1:200 dilution; Abcam) for 30 min at room temperature. The nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min and mounted in VectaMount Permanent Mounting Medium. The samples were imaged on a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880), and the images were prepared using the ZEN software.\n"," ELISA ELISA was performed to detect the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein to sACE2 receptor, as previously described. 27 ,32,34 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBDs, as well as sDPP4 protein, were used as controls. Briefly, ELISA plates were precoated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV RBD (1 μg/ml) overnight at 4°C and blocked with 2% fat-free milk in PBST for 2 h at 37°C. Serially diluted sACE2, or sDPP4, protein was added to the plates and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. After four washes, the bound protein was detected using hACE2-or hDPP4-specific goat antibody (0.5 μg/ml, R&D system) for 2 h at 37°C, followed by incubation with HRPconjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (1:5,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was visualized by addition of substrate 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and stopped by H 2 SO 4 (1 N). The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured by an ELISA plate reader (Tecan, San Jose, CA).\n"," The cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein to SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibody was performed by coating ELISA plates with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (1 μg/ml), as well as SARS-CoV RBD or MERS-CoV RBD (as controls, 1 μg/ml), followed by sequential incubation with serially diluted SARS-CoV RBD-or MERS-CoV RBD-immunized mouse sera and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) antibodies.\n"," Pseudovirus neutralization and inhibition assays SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was generated, as previously described, with some modifications. 25, 27, 29 Briefly, 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferaseexpressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and a plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 S protein using the calcium phosphate method.

It has been well recognised as a common opportunistic pathogen in the clinic Li et al., 2017a) . Recently, it has been reported that the prevalence of S. maltophilia infection in intensive care units has been increasing continuously (Chang et al., 2012) . Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is a unique protein on the surface or embedded in the cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is closely associated with the development of bacterial infection and the activation of host immune response (March et al., 2011; Li et al., 2019) . Previous studies have suggested that the pathogenicity of S. maltophilia may be associated with OmpA-medicated adhesion to the host cells and the consequent stimulation of host cell apoptosis (Gaddy et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010) . The impact of OmpA on host cell apoptosis varies greatly depending on the differences in the secondary structure of OmpA. Previous studies found that A. baumannii OmpA induces Hela cells autophagy by activating the MAPK/JNK signalling pathway . Similarly, researchers have reported that A. baumannii OmpA stimulates epithelial and dendritic cell apoptosis (Choi et al., 2005 (Choi et al., , 2008 Lee et al., 2010) and have found that Leptospirosis Loa22, a member of the OmpA family, triggers apoptosis of A549 cells (Wu et al., 2011) . In contrast to these findings, E. coli K1 OmpA inhibits host cell apoptosis (Sukumaran et al., 2004) . The role of mitochondria in apoptosis has been well-described. A key event in the mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis is the permeabilisation of the mitochondrial outer membrane. The outer mitochondrial membrane may be affected by adverse factors, leading to the leakage of mitochondrial membrane proteins such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor into the cytoplasm. The release of cytochrome c activates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3 and initiates apoptosis (Elmore, 2007; Pistritto et al., 2016) . Bcl-2 family proteins include pro-apoptotic proteins and pro-survival proteins that promote or prevent apoptosis by govering permeabilisation of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The pro-survival proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) prevent the translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondria while the pro-apopotic proteins (Bax and Bak) enhance cytochrome c release (Birkinshaw and Czabotar, 2017) . In addition, prosurvival proteins surpress the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the generation of Ca 2+ (Zhao et al., 2016) . Therefore, we investigated the role of mitochondrial pathways in S. maltophilia OmpA-induced apoptosis in this study.\n"," Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units and most commonly involve the lower airways, which are preceded by bacterial colonisation of the upper airways. Similar to other opportunistic pathogens, S. maltophilia invasion of the upper respiratory tract promotes bacterial colonisation. Upper respiratory tract colonisation not only causes disease, but also drives the evolution of these opportunistic pathogens (Siegel and Weiser, 2015) . Therefore, we employed human laryngeal epithelial HEp-2 cells to investigated the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by S. maltophilia OmpA. HEp-2 cell is derived from epithelial laryngeal carcinoma cells, which is widely used in studies evaluating cellular proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (Lopes et al., 2020) .\n"," The bacteria strain S. maltophilia K279a was used in this study due to the availability of the entire genome sequence, which is representative of this species.

The differences between the treatment groups were compared by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. The results were obtained from at least three independent experiments and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n"," We developed the His-tagged rOmpA in our previous study (Xu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019) . The recombinant plasmid expressing S. maltophilia K279a OmpA was transformed into E. coli BL21, which was cultured and induced by IPTG. rOmpA was purified with a HiTrap chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analysed by western blot. We found that purified rabbit anti-rOmpA serum reacted with both rOmpA and S. maltophilia K279a outer membrane proteins (Fig. 1) . Fluor 647 dye molecules was used to label rOmpA, which attaches to proteins at high molar ratios without significant self-quenching. BSA was used as the control and purified His-tagged rOmpW was used as the isotype control. The HEp-2 cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor ® 647 labelled rOmpA for 4 h.

Purified rabbit anti-rOmpA serum was used as the primary antibody and goat IRDye680RD-labelled anti-rabbit IgG antibody was used as the secondary antibody. Purified Histagged rOmpW was used as the isotype control.\n"," OmpA proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, and intracellular survival. Namba et al. (2008) reported that OmpA is involved in adhesion of Aeromonas veronii to host cells and Shin et al. (2005) found that E. coli OmpA adheres to human brain microvascular endothelial cells. To assess the adhesion of rOmpA to HEp-2 cells, we exposed HEp-2 cells to rOmpA labelled with Alexa Fluor ® 647 and analysed the fluorescence by flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Alexa Fluor ® 647 represented the adhesion to HEp-2 cells. We observed that the MFI of the 10 μg/ml and 30 μg/ml rOmpA groups were 2.37E4 and 5.17E4, respectively, compared with an MFI of 597 in the control group. The MFI of the 30 μg/ml rOmpA group was significantly higher than the control group, suggesting that rOmpA adhered to HEp-2 cells (Fig. 2) . Besides, we also found mitochondrial localisation of rOmpA in HEp-2 cells (Supplementary data Fig. S1 ).\n"," Apoptotic cells are characterised by reduced cell size, nuclear condensation, nucleolus fragmentation, increased chromatin density, concentrated cytoplasm, and increased organelle density (Henry et al., 2013; Atale et al., 2014) . We tested the impact of different concentration of rOmpA (10 μg/ml and 30 μg/ml) on HEp-2 cell apoptosis. We used 0.1 μM ST to promote HEp-2 cell apoptosis as a positive control, bacteria-free PBS as a negative control, and 30 μg/ml heat-inactivated rOmpA as another negative control to exclude the influence of LPS on the experiment. Cellular morphology was observed by confocal microscopy and nuclei were stained with DAPI. After 8 h of treatment, nucleus roundness and pyknosis became apparent in the 30 μg/ml rOmpA group and the 0.1 μM ST group. In comparison, HEp-2 cells exposed to 10 μg/ml rOmpA showed some degree of nucleolysis (Fig. 3A) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed that chromatin condensation appeared in the nucleus after 8 h of 0.1 μM ST or 30 μg/ml rOmpA treatment. These typical apoptotic characteristics supported that rOmpA induced HEp-2 cell apoptosis (Fig. 3B) . To further verify that rOmpA can induce HEp-2 cell apoptosis, the apoptotic and necrotic cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin V/PI staining. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is located in the inner cell membrane under physiological conditions. PS externalization occurs in early apoptotic cells, which results in a positive stain for annexin V whereas living cells remain annexin V negative. Although annexin V can be used to detect apoptosis, necrotic cells also become annexin V-positive as annexin V binds to internal PS. However, combination with PI double-labelling allows for further distinction between necrotic (annexin V+/ PI+) and early apoptotic (annexin V+/PI−) cells (Henry et al., 2013; Wallberg et al., 2016) . In this study, annexin V-APC and PI dye were used in flow cytometric analyses and detected rOmpA-induced HEp-2 cell apoptosis (Fig. 4) . Speci- Purified His-tagged recombinant rOmpW was used as the isotype control. The red line represents the control group and the blue line in each histogram respectively represents the positive depolarisation control group, the 0.1 μΜ ST group, the 10 μg/ml rOmpA group, the 30 μg/ml rOmpA group, the heated-inactivated rOmpA group, and the isotype control group. MFI lower than the control indicates mitochondrial membrane potential depolarisation. (B) Western blot of AIF and cytochrome c. Mitochondrial fractions and cytosolic fractions were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with anti-AIF and anti-cytochrome c antibody. The results are from one representative experiment of three independent experiments. fically, few apoptotic cells were detected in the control group and heat-inactivated rOmpA group, in which the proportions of early and late apoptotic cells were 0.623% and 1.92% in the control group and 0.753% and 2.33% in the heat-inactivated rOmpA group. The number of apoptotic cells was increased after exposure to 0.1 μM ST and 30 μg/ml rOmpA group with early and late apoptotic cells proportions of 6.02% and 56.2% in the 0.1 μM ST group and 10.2% and 46.3% in the 30 μg/ml rOmpA group. Furthermore, the proportions of early and late apoptotic cells were 1.98% and 4.4% in the 10 μg/ml rOmpA group (Fig. 4) . These data suggested that 30 μg/ml rOmpA induced HEp-2 cells apoptosis.\n"," Apoptotic pathways include internal mitochondrial apoptosis, death receptor-mediated external apoptosis, and lysosomal apoptosis. Previous studies on Acinetobacter baumannii OmpA-induced apoptosis showed that epithelial cell apoptosis was mediated by the mitochondrial pathway (Choi et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2010) . Activation of mitochondrial apoptosis is associated with upregulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak and downregulation of pro-survival proteins including Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 (Zhou et al., 2011; Birkinshaw and Czabotar, 2017 ). In the current study, HEp-2 cells treated with 0.1 μM ST and 30 μg/ml rOmpA showed significantly higher Bax protein levels than the control group. In contrast, Bax in the heat-inactivated rOmpA group did not significantly differ from the control group (Fig. 5) . Exposure to 10 μg/ml rOmpA also increased Bax protein levels. Contrary to Bax, Bcl-xL protein levels were reduced by rOmpA and ST treatment (Fig. 5 ). In addition, our data also demonstrated that rOmpA was unable to regulate the expression of Fas and FasL in HEp-2 cells (Supplementary data Fig. S2 ), indicating no activation of the death receptor pathway.\n"," Bcl-xL maintains normal mitochondrial permeability by in-hibiting mPTP. The opening of mPTP may destroy mitochondrial membrane integrity and thus directly collapse the normal mitochondrial membrane potential (Gyulkhandanyan et al., 2015) . In the current study, we detected the mitochondrial membrane potential by staining HEp-2 cells with TMRE. FCCP is a protonophore that depolarises mitochondria and was used as a positive control for loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and PBS was used as a negative control. Flow cytometry showed that the MFI of the positive control and the 30 μg/ml rOmpA group were 2.58E5 and 5.96E5 whereas the MFI of the control group was 9.58E5, indicating mitochondrial membrane depolarisation and opening of mPTP (Fig. 6A) , which has been reported to induce the release of cytochrome c and AIF (Zhang et al., 2017; Negara et al., 2018) and initiate apoptosis. Western blot showed that the 0.1 μΜ ST group had significantly higher cytoplasmic cytochrome c and AIF levels compared with the other groups (Fig. 6B) . The cytoplasmic cytochrome c and AIF levels were also significantly higher after treatment with 30 μg/ml rOmpA compared with controls whereas they did not differ significantly between the heat-inactivated rOmpA group and the control group (Fig. 6B) . In contrast to the impact of rOmpA on cytoplasmic cytochrome c and AIF levels, 0.1 μΜ ST and 30 μg/ml rOmpA significantly lowered mitochondrial cytochrome c and AIF compared with controls (Fig. 6B) . These data suggested that rOmpA induced the release of cytochrome c and AIF into the cytoplasm.\n"," Bax may cause transient mPTP opening, which promotes ROS accumulation and favors mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation. This subsequently elevates the generation of ROS and facilitates the release of cytochrome c (Birkinshaw and Czabotar, 2017) . Simultaneously, mitochondria are the major source of ROS, which contribute to apoptotic cell death (Sinha et al., 2013) . In this study, we evaluated ROS generation in rOmpA-treated HEp-2 cells by DCFH-DA. We found that ROS levels in the 0.1 μΜ ST group were significantly higher than that in the control group and the differences in ROS levels between the 30 μg/ml rOmpA group and the con- trol group were small but statistically significant. ROS levels in the 10 μg/ml rOmpA group and the heat-inactivated rOmpA group remained at baseline levels (Fig. 7A ). These data demonstrated that rOmpA induced the increase of intracellular ROS levels. Ca 2+ is one of the most versatile signals involved in the control of cellular processes and functions such as cell survival and death (Zhang et al., 2016) . Wang et al. (2013) found that ROS production and intracellular Ca 2+ accumulation both induced HepG2 cell apoptosis. We measured Ca 2+ levels using a Fluo-3/AM fluorescent probe and observed small but significant differences after exposing HEp-2 cells to 30 μg/ml rOmpA compared with the controls, indicating that rOmpA increased Ca 2+ in HEp-2 cells (Fig. 7B) .\n"," The openning of mPTP results in the release of cytochrome c and AIF from mitochondria to the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, dATP, Apaf-1, and procaspase-9 in the cytoplasm can form a large apoptotic body, which upon induction of apoptosis processes pro-caspase 9 into a large (37 kDa) and a small (10 kDa) subunit. Cleaved caspase-9 can further activate downstream procaspase-3 (Liu et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017b) , which is expressed in cells as an inactive precursor that is proteolytically generated during apoptosis. In our study, treatment with 0.1 μM ST and 30 μg/ml rOmpA showed significant caspase-9 cleavage in HEp-2 cells while exposure to 10 μg/ml rOmpA and heat-inactivated rOmpA did not result in caspase-9 cleavage. Cleaved caspase-3 in the 0.1 μM ST group was significantly elevated compared with the other groups and similarly, cleaved caspase-3 in the 30 μg/ml rOmpA group was significantly higher compared with the control group (Fig. 8) . Poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARP) are a group of proteins present in most eukaryotic cells. The posttranslational modification enzyme PARP-1 is an important substrate for caspase-3. When apoptosis occurs, PARP-1 is inhibited by caspase-3, leading to the cleavage of PARP (Wang et al., 2011; Galia et al., 2012) . In our study, we found an incease in the active forms of both molecules in the 0.1 μM ST group and the 30 μg/ml rOmpA group, resulting in the cleavage of PARP (Fig. 8) . In summary, rOmpA stimulated the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 apoptosis pathway in HEp-2 cells.\n"," Our study revealed a new understanding of the molecular mechanism of S. maltophilia OmpA on the induction of apoptosis in HEp-2 cells. OmpA is the main outer membrane protein of Gram-negative bacteria, which maintains the integrity of bacterial outer membrane structure and normal inheritance of bacterial morphology (Confer and Ayalew, 2013) . OmpA is also a bridge between bacteria and host, being of great significance during bacterial infections and the subsequent host immune resistance (Smith et al., 2007) . Choi et al. (2005) reported that OmpA directly adheres and invades the host cells and thus leads to cell apoptosis through the destruction of the nucleus and mitochondria. Acinetobacter baumannii OmpA adheres to HeLa cells and induces autophagy in HeLa cells and OmpA knockdown strains have decreased ability to replicate and adhere to host cells both in vitro and in vivo (Gaddy et al., 2009 ). In agreement with these studies, we found that rOmpA adhered to HEp-2 cells. Studies have found that bacterial outer membrane vesicles mediate delivery of OmpA to enter host cells, which are spontaneously released by Gram-negative bacteria (Gnopo et al., 2020; Mancini et al., 2020) . However, the mechanism by which S. maltophilia OmpA enters the host cell is unclear and is a target for future studies.\n"," The typical ultrastructural changes of apoptotic cells include the decrease or disappearance of villi on the cell surface, the shrinkage of the nuclear membrane, the decrease of nuclear volume, chromatin aggregation, and appearance of vacuoles in the cytoplasm (Atale et al., 2014) . To determine whether the purified rOmpA was biologically active, we first observed the morphological and nucleus changes of HEp-2 cells after stimulation with 30 μg/ml rOmpA and detected nucleus roundness, pyknosis and chromatin aggregation. These results were consistent with the characteristics of apoptosis and rOmpAinduced cell apoptosis was further confirmed by annexin V/PI. Taken together, these data indicated that 30 μg/ml rOmpA induced apoptosis of HEp-2 cells. The group of proteins known as Bcl-2 family members are the central players of apoptosis (Renault et al., 2016) . The proapoptotic protein Bax induces cell death via mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation that leads to the release of small proapoptotic molecules such as cytochrome c. However, Bax can be inhibited by the overexpression of the pro-survival proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Bcl-xL is an important member of the Bcl-2 family and its reduction further promotes mPTP opening and increased mitochondrial membrane permeability (Kim, 2005) . We found that 30 μg/ml rOmpA caused upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-xL. We also observed that the depolarisation of mitochondrial memb- Fig. 8 . Activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and cleavage of PARP. HEp-2 cells were treated for 8 h with rOmpA. The cell lysates were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-9 and anti-PARP antibody. The results are from one representative experiment of three independent experiments. rane potential in HEp-2 cells was stimulated by exposure to 30 μg/ml rOmpA. With the increase of mitochondrial membrane permeability, cytochrome c and AIF were released to the cytoplasm from mitochondria (Morris et al., 2018) . After released into the cytoplasm, cytochrome c binds to apoptotic protease activating facter-1 (Apaf-1) and procaspase-9, initiating apoptosis (Kang et al., 2018) . Rumbo et al. (2014) found that Acinetobacter baumannii OmpA localises to the mitochondria and induces apoptosis of epithelial cells by releasing cytochrome c and AIF. In our present stduy, the protein levels of cytoplasmic cytochrome c and AIF were opposite to those in mitochondria, indicating that cytochrome c and AIF were released into the cytosol as a consequence of mitochondrial disintegation, which was consistent with the features of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. It has been described that increased mitochondrial permeability dissipates the proton electrochemical gradient, leading to ATP depletion and further ROS production (Sinha et al., 2013) . Furthermore, ROS generation has a strong influence the mPTP opening (Zhang et al., 2016) . In our study, we demonstrated that rOmpA induced the production of ROS in HEp-2 cells. Intracellular calcium Ca 2+ is a critical second messenger and regulator of cell apoptosis (Meng et al., 2014) . The increase of Ca 2+ concentration favours ROS generation and promotes the opening of mPTP. We showed that 30 μg/ml rOmpA induced the production of ROS and increased the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration in HEp-2 cells. PARP-1 is a substrate for caspase-3 activation and PARP is normally cleaved by caspases during apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a cysteine protease with aspartic specificity and a well-characterised effector of apoptosis signalling (Cregan et al., 2004) . This study demonstrated that 30 μg/ml rOmpA induced cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP. These findings confirmed that rOmpA sequentially activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, which are main components of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In summary, the findings of the present study indicated that S. maltophilia OmpA was a virulence factor that adhered to epithelial cells and induced cell death by the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. OmpA regulated Bax and Bcl-xL protein expression and promoted the release of pro-apoptotic molecules such as cytochrome c and AIF. Apoptosis of epithelial cells may allow the bacteria to access the deeper tissues in the lung. We provide improved elucidation of the pathogenic role of S. maltophilia OmpA in apoptosis.\n","Score: 3.516094272221777\n","\n","Title: Nasal delivery of single-domain antibody improves symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an animal model\n","Body Text: Introduction Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. They are divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma and delta. Betacoronaviruses are significant interest because they are responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics in the past and now, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic. These viruses can cause mild to severe respiratory tract infections and death in some cases. All betacoronaviruses feature a spike protein on their surface that assists entry into cells. The spike (S) protein has two distinct subunits, S1 and S2, and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit interacts with the host cell receptor. The S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 (virus causing SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing bind to the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). After binding to ACE2 via the RBD, a protease on the host cell surface cleaves and activates the S protein, allowing the virus membrane to fuse with the host cell membrane. Blocking this viral fusion is thought to be a promising therapeutic strategy [1, 2] . Furthermore, because SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in the nasal mucosa or lungs that express ACE2 [3] , direct delivery of antiviral drugs to the respiratory system is expected to improve drug efficacy.\n"," Camelid single-domain antibodies are a unique class of antibodies that consist of a single heavy chain. Variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibodies (VHHs) binds viruses, such as influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [4] . These antibodies, which consist of single amino acid chains, bind specific antigens with high affinity and specificity. Unlike human monoclonal antibodies, VHHs can be easily modified and produced using bacteria. They are also stable against heat and pH, allowing them to be stored longer than human monoclonal antibodies and, therefore, stockpiled for epidemics. Being stable also means VHHs can be nebulized and administered via an inhaler directly to infected lungs. The first VHH undergoing clinical trials for direct delivery into the lung by nebulization to treat RSV was ALX-0171 [4] . In vitro studies show ALX-0171 binds to the F protein in RSV with higher affinity than the approved human monoclonal antibody prophylactic drug, Palivizumab [5] . Intranasal administration to cotton rats reduced RSV load in the nose and lung [5, 6] . Recently, a VHH or single-domain antibody against SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 has also been identified [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , and these VHHs inhibit ACE2 binding and block the infection. The VHH (termed VHH-72) neutralizes SARS-CoV-1; however, it must be fused with an Fc domain of a human antibody to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [7] . Fc-fusion enhanced the neutralizing effect of Ty1 [9] , Sb23 [10] , and H11-H4 [11] , but not that of n3088, n3130 [8] and Nb11-59 [12] . While effective in neutralizing the virus in vitro, exactly it remains unclear how these VHHs perform in vivo.\n"," Here, using the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein as an antigen, we screened an extensive DNA library and found a standalone VHH that is specific for SARS-CoV-2. This new VHH (termed K-874A) bound SARS-CoV-2 S protein with higher affinity than previous VHHs [7, 8] and does not require any modification with antibody fragments, making them a very attractive therapeutic candidate. We showed that K-874A effectively neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. When intranasally administered to SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters, K-874A prevented weight loss, reduced viral replication in the lungs and prevented cytokine induction that are characteristic of a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results demonstrated the K-874A may lead to develop therapeutic drug against SARS-CoV-2.\n"," We used VHH-cDNA display for in vitro selection of VHHs against the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein ( Fig 1A) . cDNA display yields functional VHHs, whose coding RNA is linked via a puromycin linker [13] [14] [15] . This procedure selects the coding sequences for high-affinity VHHs from a diverse (10 13−14 ) DNA library [16] . To select the VHH candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins, DNA libraries at Round 2 (R2) and Round 3 (R3) of in vitro selection were sequenced, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 VHH candidates were translated.\n"," From the frequency distribution of VHH clones in the selected library, clone K-874A appeared most frequently (39.5%) after three rounds of in vitro selection, indicating that K-874A has a high affinity for S1 proteins (Fig 1B) . Biolayer interferometry assay showed the binding affinity of K-874A to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein is 1.4 nM (K a (1/Ms) = 6.72E+04, K d (1/ s) = 9.42E-05) (Fig 1C) . When a direct antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed using FLAG-tagged K-874A and immobilized recombinant His-tagged S1 protein, we found that K-874A bound with high affinity to the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 but not to other coronaviruses, including human CoV (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43) and SARS-CoV-1, even when all S1-6xHis subunit were immobilized ( Fig 1D) . These results indicate that K-874A binds strongly and specifically to the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2.\n"," With its strong binding affinity and specificity to SARS-CoV-2, we investigated K-874A as a potential therapeutic drug for COVID-19. We infected African green monkey kidney (VeroE6) cells expressing transmembrane serine protease 2 (VeroE6/TMPRSS2) with SARS-CoV-2 (KUH003) and determined how well K-874A inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in the cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) calculated from RNA copies was 5.74±2.6 μg/mL (Fig 2A) .\n"," To determine whether K-874A VHH neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by preventing the virus from attaching to the host cell, we compared the early phases of infection in cells infected with K-874A-treated virus and untreated virus. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were incubated with K-874Atreated SARS-CoV-2 and untreated virus for 1 hr, and the number of RNA copies that were attached or incorporated into the cells were determined by qRT-PCR. K-874A treatment did not change the levels of virus attachment or early incorporation in the cells (Fig 2B) . At 6 hr post-infection, the number of viral RNA copies in cells infected with untreated virus were increased more than 400 times, but the numbers were remarkably inhibited in cells infected with K-874A treated virus ( Fig 2C) . Additionally, expression of the viral protein, NSP8, and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is generated during viral RNA replication, were suppressed in cells infected with K-874A-treated viruses (Fig 2D) . These results indicated that K-874A did not reduce viral attachment. against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein using VHH-cDNA display. In vitro transcription and translation of VHH-cDNA library form VHH linked to its mRNA with a puromycin linker. cDNA of linked mRNA was reverse-transcribed and VHH-cDNA complex was produced. High-affinity VHH-cDNA complex to immobilized S1 protein was isolated, and its cDNA was amplified. Three rounds of selection were performed, cDNA libraries from rounds 2 and 3 were sequenced, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 VHH candidates were translated. (B) Frequency distribution of amino acid sequences corresponding to VHH antibody candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunits in the selected VHH libraries.

Data are from a representative experiment of three independent experiments. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009542.g001\n"," VHH treatment to SARS-CoV-2-infected animal model Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by K-874A VHH. SARS-CoV-2 was pretreated with different concentrations of K-874A and inoculated into VeroE6/TRMPSS2 cells. Fold-reductions in viral RNA copies in culture supernatants were calculated by qRT-PCR. K-874A has an IC 50 of 5.74±2.6 μg/ml. Error bars indicate mean ± SD from three independent experiments. (B) The numbers of viral RNA copies in VeroE6/TMRPSS2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (untreated) and SARS-CoV-2 pretreated with K-874A VHH (K-874A-treated) were similar.

(D) Immunofluorescence images show viral protein, NSP8, and RNA replication are suppressed in Vero/TMPRSS2 cells infected with K-874A-treated SARS-CoV-2.

(E) Cell fusion induced by S protein transduction in HiBiT-and LgBiT-expressing VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Treatment with K-874A VHH suppressed cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner.

Immobilized S protein was detected by serially diluted K-874A (1 to 0.002 μg/well) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-VHH antibody (left), or by serially diluted ACE2 protein (20 to 0.0625 μg/ml) and anti-ACE2 antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (right). Binding of ACE2 to S protein was unaffected by K-874A (1 μg/well) treatment.\n"," https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009542.g002\n"," VHH treatment to SARS-CoV-2-infected animal model We further investigated whether K-874A acts by inhibiting the virus from fusing with the host cell. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells express the ACE2 receptor and the TMPRSS2 protease on its surface. To study viral fusion, we transduced the VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells with a lentivirus coding for the viral S protein into the cells. When the S protein from one VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cell binds to the ACE2 receptor on an adjacent VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cell, the TMPRSS2 protease cleaves and activates the S protein for fusion. To quantify this cell fusion, we used HiBiT technology, which involves the binding of HiBiT (a small 11-amino acid peptide) with a larger subunit, called LgBiT, to form a complex with luciferase activity. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells expressing HiBiT or LgBiT were produced and co-cultivated. The HiBiT-LgBiT complex and the resulting luciferase activity form only when the S protein from one cell binds to the ACE2 receptor on an adjacent cell and their membranes are fused. We found that treating VeroE6/ TMPRSS2 cells with K-874A suppressed cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2E) . Cells without S protein (S ) did not fuse, whereas those expressing S protein but not treated with K-874A (S+) did fuse. Optical micrographs confirmed these results ( Fig 2F) . Direct binding of K-874A or recombinant ACE2 to immobilized recombinant S protein in ELISA further showed that both K-874A (left panel in Fig 2G) and ACE2 (blue line on right panel in Fig 2G) bound to S protein in a dose-dependent manner. However, K-874A did not block ACE2-S protein interaction (red line on right panel in Fig 2G) . These findings suggest that K-874A does not prevent the virus from attaching to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface. Rather, K-874A prevents the virus from entering the cell by blocking the viral membrane from fusing with the host cell.\n"," To estimate the K-874A binding region on the S protein, we reconstructed the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the recombinant S protein trimer (S1 Fig) and its complex with K-874A complex (S2 Fig), and fitted each molecular model to the maps (S3G-S3I Fig) . As a result, we acquired two types of the complex structures, named type 1 and type 2 (S2 Fig). The ratio of type 1 and type 2 particles was approximately 9:1. The type 1 structure showed that K-874A was located in the vacant space between the NTD and RBD of the S protein (Figs 3A-3D, and S3B, S3E and S3H). In the prefusion state, the RBD moves upwards to bind ACE2 [17, 18] . However, the RBD in the type 1 structure did not rise up after binding K-874A and moved laterally to the outside of the S protein trimer (S5A Fig). The NTD moved down after binding of K-874A. Amino acid residues in CDR1, CDR2, and N-terminal of K-874A formed polar bonds with the NTD of the S protein, whereas amino acid residues of CDR2 and CDR3 bonded hydrophobically with the RBD (Fig 3B-3D ). In the type 2 structure, K-874A was bound only to the RBD and not to the NTD (S3C, S3F, S3I and S4 Figs). The S protein trimer was in the prefusion state with RBD moving upwards (S5B Fig). All amino acid residues that interact with ACE2 were placed in the upward state of RBD, even when the RBD was bound to K-874A, demonstrating that ACE2 binds to RBD even in the bound state of K-874A (Fig 3E and 3F ). These findings demonstrate that K-874A neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 via a different route that did not involve ACE2 binding.\n"," We evaluated the binding affinity and the neutralization effect of K-874A against variants prevalent to date. Calu3 cells were infected with each variant and incubated for an hour. Neutralized variants did not have the mutation in K-874A binding motif at amino acids 450-490 of the S protein; however, un-neutralized variants had some mutations. These finding suggested that it would be neutralized if K-874A is strongly bound to S protein and targeting to applicable motif of S proteins may lead to a highly effective VHH to neutralize these un-neutralized variants.\n"," Because SARS-CoV-2 targets lung tissues and induces severe respiratory disease, we evaluated K-874A VHH in a human lung-derived alveolar organoid that is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and releases high levels of progeny virus into the culture supernatant [19, 20] . To determine if K-874A blocks production of virus progeny in infected alveolar organoids, we incubated the organoid cells with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hr before treating the infected cells with K-874A-containing medium for 3 days. Untreated cells released >1x10 7 RNA copies/μL into the culture supernatant at day 3, and VHH treatment reduced the progeny production to 1x10 4 RNA copies/μL (Fig 4A) , indicating that K-874A reduced the production of virus progeny. To test the infectivity of virus progeny produced from K-874A-treated and untreated infected cells, we adjusted each viral progeny to 1x10 4 RNA copies and incubated with fresh VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Untreated virus progeny showed 565 TCID 50 /ml, and K-874A-treated virus progeny showed fewer than 10 TCID 50 /ml ( Fig 4B) . These data suggested that the K-874A-treated progeny have a lower infectivity. This is likely due to K-874A VHH binding to the S protein of the virus progeny, preventing them from infecting other cells.\n"," We further tested K-874A VHH as a potential therapeutic drug for COVID-19 in the Syrian hamster model. When infected with SARS-CoV-2, Syrian hamsters lose weight but spontaneously heal by 14 days post-infection [21] . To determine if K-874A improves the symptoms of COVID-19 infection, we infected 6-week-old male Syrian hamsters with SARS-CoV-2 (2 x 10 3 TCID 50 ) and administrated different regimens of K-874A intranasally. The animals were treated with a single dose of K-874A just before the infection or at 1 day after the infection, or multiple doses at 1 and 2 days after the infection ( Fig 4C) . Each dose of K-874A was 30 mg/kg, which was determined to be the maximum dose that can be administrated. All infected animals treated with K-874A did not lose weight, but infected control animals treated with bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (BSA/PBS) lost weight 3 days after the infection ( Fig 4D) . Further, all K-874A-treated hamsters, regardless of treatment regimen, had fewer viral RNA copies in their lung tissues than BSA/PBS-treated hamsters 4 days after the infection ( Fig 4E) . Because cytokines are upregulated after an infection [22, 23] , we compared the mRNA levels of several cytokines in the infected lung tissues of the untreated and K-874Atreated animals. Untreated animals showed elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-10 but not IL-1β and TNF-α, in their lungs 4 days after the infection. All K-874A-treated animals, regardless of the treatment regimen, displayed cytokine levels that were similar to uninfected animals ( Fig 4F) . When different doses (1. Their IL-6 and IL-10, but not IL-1β and TNF-α, levels were also higher than those receiving PLOS PATHOGENS VHH treatment to SARS-CoV-2-infected animal model Graph shows infected alveolar organoid treated with K-874A-containing medium for 3 days released fewer RNA copies (1x10 4 RNA copies/μL) into the culture supernatant than organoids that were not treated with K-874A (>1x10 5 RNA copies/μL).

Error bars indicate mean ± SEM. Black dotted line indicates detection limit. (N = 5, � P<0.05, Welch's t-test) (C) Time schedule for inoculation and K-874A administration to Syrian hamsters. All animals were infected with 2x10 3 \n"," Besides vaccines, therapeutic drugs are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 infections. VHH are promising drug candidates because they are more stable and cheaper to produce than human monoclonal antibodies. They are also amenable to nasal administration, allowing high concentrations of drugs to reach directly to infected lungs and remain effective for longer. Indeed, nasal administered VHH against RSV is effective for 3 days [6] . However, due to their low molecular weight, VHH monomers have very short half-lives in the blood stream [4] . VHHs under development as antivirals need to be multivalent or modified with human antibody fragments to enhance their antiviral effect or extend their half-life. A previous report showed VHH that bound to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 could neutralize the virus only when VHH was fused with an Fc domain of a human antibody [7] .\n"," Here, using in vitro selection, we identified a standalone anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 VHH that binds to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with a higher or equivalent affinity or neutralizing ability than previous VHHs or single domain antibody [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Furthermore, it displays excellent neutralizing ability in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells and human normal alveolar-derived cells. Although accurate comparison the affinity or neutralizing IC 50 between labs is difficult, the binding affinity of K-874A was 1.4 nM and IC 50 was 5.74±2.6 μg/ml in contrast to reported VHHs (e.g., VHH-72 (K D = 38.6 nM, IC 50 = 0.2 μg/ml) [7] , n3088 (K D = 3.7 nM, IC 50 = 3.3 μg/ml) [8] , Ty1 (K D = 5-10 nM, IC 50 = 0.77 μg/ml) [9] , Sb23 (K D = 10 nM, IC 50 = 0.6 μg/ ml) [10] , H11-H4 (K D = 5 nM, IC 50 = 61 nM) [11] , Nb11-59 (K D = 20 nM, IC 50 = <1 μg/ml) [12] ). Fc-fusion was necessary to achieve the IC 50 of these previous reported VHHs, except n3088 and Nb11-59, and these mainly targeted ACE2 binding.\n"," We found that this VHH neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by preventing the virus membrane from fusing with the host cell membrane. Cryo-EM analysis of the S protein-VHH complex revealed that the VHH binds between the RBD and NTD region on the S protein, rather than at the interface of the RBD and ACE2. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by NTD-binding human antibody was also reported [24] ; however, it was clearly different domain of previous reported VHHs (S10 Fig). Our cryo-EM data indicated that K-874A binding induced a conformational change of S protein (S5 Fig) , but more investigation is required to determine the neutralizing mechanism independent of RBD-ACE2 binding inhibition. In human lung-derived alveolar organoids, the VHH reduced the production of virus progeny. Moreover, virus progeny produced from VHH-treated infected cells had a lower infectivity than those from untreated infected cells, suggesting that the VHH prevents the virus from spreading to uninfected cells or persons. Intranasal administration of our VHH to SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters prevented weight loss, viral replication in the lungs and upregulation of cytokines typically caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. K-874A did not bind to S protein derived from variants that immediately before infection (K-874A/virus; red square) or 1 day after infection (+ K-874A (1); green triangle), or two doses at Day 1 and Day 2 after infection (+ K-874A (2); purple rhombus). Each dose was 3 mg K-874A per animal. \n"," VHH treatment to SARS-CoV-2-infected animal model cannot be neutralized, indicating that VHHs targeting the RBD-NTD region might effectively neutralize these variants. Furthermore, combinations of VHHs targeting different epitope (e.g., the NTD-RBD targeted VHH with RBD-targeting VHH) may lead to development of cocktail therapeutics. Since new variants will likely appear in the future, we need to develop neutralizing VHHs targeting the conserved region.\n"," Our VHH has several advantages. Inhaling a human monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 can inhibit virus replication in the lung and nasal turbinate [25] . This suggests that the therapeutic benefits of our VHH could also be delivered using a nebulizer. Nasal administration via a nebulizer is expected to lower the amount of VHH entering the blood stream, which could reduce the risk of immunoreaction against VHH on repeated use. In support of the use VHHs for therapeutics to patients, nebulization and humanization of VHH were successfully implemented without impairing the stability or the neutralizing ability [12] . Further, because our VHH displays striking antiviral effects without the additional Fc domain, its risk to Fcrelated antibody-dependent enhancement is likely to be low.\n"," Abnormal secretion of cytokines is a hallmark of serious cases of COVID-19 infections [26] . While it remains unknown why such cytokine storms occur, ACE2 may be an interferonstimulated gene that SARS-CoV-2 could exploit to enhance infection [3] . Because our VHH prevents viral fusion, we believe that it can reduce viral infection and, in turn, inhibit interferon upregulation. The efficacy of our VHH could also be improved if used in conjunction with antibodies that block ACE2-RBD binding. \n"," A cDNA display library (200 pmol-scale) used for the 1 st round of selection (R1) was synthesized from an initial VHH-encoding DNA library (predicted diversity, 1x10 13 ), provided by Epsilon Molecular Engineering Co.

The 3D map reconstructed from 14,235 particles was estimated to be 6.9Å, based on a gold standard FSC. The entire procedure and the processing data are summarized in S1  Fig and S1 Table.\n"," The SWISS-MODEL [36] server was used to generate homology models of K-874A and S protein monomer of SARS-CoV-2 (SPN-C52H9) using the atomic models of VHH-72 (PDB ID: 6WAQ) and 2019-nCoV S protein (PDB ID: 6VSB) as templates, respectively. The amino acid sequence comparisons between SPN-C52H9 and 6VSB and between K-874A and VHH-72 are shown in S6 and S7 Figs. Multiple-sequence alignments of these proteins were performed using the PROMALS3D program [37] . The homology models were manually modified in the individual maps using COOT [38] and refined using PHENIX [39] . Type 1 and Type 2 structures consisting of the K-874A S protein trimer showed almost similar interactions with the same amino acid residues between K-874A and RBD, although the models were built independently.

In the type 1 structure (approximately 90% of the S protein and K-874A complex), the K-874A bound moved the RBD sideways and the NTD down. In the case of type 2 structure (approximately 10% of the S protein and K-874A complex), the K-874A bound to the upward state of the RBD and the NTD did not interact directly with K-874 but moved slightly aside. \n","Score: 3.5078875765136233\n","\n","Title: Efficacy and immunogenicity of recombinant swinepox virus expressing the A epitope of the TGEV S protein\n","Body Text: Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a member of Coronaviridae, which is the etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis. Although the virus is capable of infecting swine of all ages, suckling piglets are the most susceptible and have a mortality rate up to 100% [1] . TGEV is a pleomorphic enveloped virus containing a positive-stranded RNA genome and four structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, the integral membrane (M) protein, the minor envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Among which, the spike (s) protein, one of the key structural membrane proteins of coronaviruses, is an attractive target for generating neutralizing antibodies against the virus due to the critical role it plays in the host cell invasion [2, 3] . Precisely, the S protein mediates the attachment of virus particles to targets via binding of itself to the specific receptors. At the N terminus of the S protein, there are four antigenic sites, A, B, C, and D, which have been shown to be involved in the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 1 ) [4] . Previous studies have determined that the A site (which is fully dependent on glycosylation for proper folding) is predominantly responsible for stimulating neutralizing host antibodies [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .\n"," SPV is a natural mild attenuated virus and has been widely applied as a vaccine. Given that Poxvirus-vectors can prevent a great deal of important diseases in both humans and animals it is not surprising that many of these vectors been licensed and used extensively [11] [12] [13] . Additionally, SPV is a safe vaccine vector as there is no risk of cross-species infection [14] . Therefore, both for biological and clinical practicality, SPV is regarded as an appropriate and promising veterinary vaccine for swine, owing to its ability to effectively express foreign genes, its large packaging capacity for recombinant DNA, its low cost of delivery and its specific host restriction [15] . The potential value of SPV as a live vector vaccine is being studied extensively. Because SPV is able to pack large amounts of recombinant DNA and to induce appropriate immune responses in vivo, it is a promising candidate for the development of a recombinant vaccine [16, 17] . As of yet, pigs are the only known hosts of swinepox virus and therefore may be useful in developing a safe vaccine for clinical application [18, 19] .\n"," In this study, we constructed a recombinant swinepox virus expressing S-A (A epitope of the S protein) of TGEV and characterized recombinant virus replication and expression of the S protein in PK-15 cells. We further investigated the potential of this approach for use in the vaccination of pigs against TGE. Type Culture Collection. Swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, China strain, SHXB) was purchased from the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the titer was determined as 1 × 10 8 PFU/ml ST cell. TGEV convalescent positive serum was purchased from the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the neutralizing antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:10,000.\n"," The pUSZ11 swinepox virus vector was generated previously [20] . Two primers, SA1 (5 -GCGTCGACATGGGTCTTGGTATGA-AGCGTAG-3 ) and SA2 (5 -CGGGATCCTTA TAGCGTCCTGT-TAGTTTGTC-3 ) were used to amplify the S-A gene (516 bp, KM980444) from the TGEV genome, which was inserted into the pUSZ11 plasmid to construct pUSZ11-SA subsequently. The recombinant swinepox virus, rSPV-SA, was generated by homologous recombination of wtSPV with pUSZ11-S-A as previously described [21] . PCR and indirect immunofluorescence were employed to analyze the S-A gene expression and the expression of S protein.\n"," The replication capacity and genetic stability of rSPV-SA were also evaluated by.\n"," The generation and screening of the recombinant swinepox virus assays were performed as described previously [20] . A subconfluent culture of PK-15 cells was infected with wtSPV (0.02 moi) for 2 h, and subsequently transfected with 10 g of the pUSZ11-SA plasmid using Exfect TM Transfection Reagent (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd). After 72 h, PK-15 cells were harvested and lysed by five rounds of freezing and thawing. Subsequently, the lysate was used to infect PK-15 cells grown in a 12-well plate for further purification of recombinant viruses. 1.5 ml of medium with 1% LMP agarose (DingGuo, beijing, china) was added to each well and incubation was continued for five days until plaques became visible under a light microscope. After 1-2 days, a second overlay medium containing X-gal was added. The plaques were resuspended in 0.3 ml of medium with 2% FBS. Plaque isolation was repeated for 5-6 rounds until all plaques in a given well were stained blue. The recombinant SPV bearing S-A of TGEV was designated as rSPV-SA.\n"," The rSPV-SA genomic DNA from the PK-15 cells infected with rSPV-SA was extracted by SDS-protease K-phenol. We utilized wtSPV genomic DNA from PK15 cells infected with wtSPV as a negative control. PCR was performed for 5 min at 94 • C; followed by 32 cycles of 1 min at 94 • C, 1 min at 50 • C, and 1 min at 72 • C. Amplifications were performed with DNA polymerase (Promega, Shanghai, China) using primers SA1 (5 -GCGTCGACATGGGTCTTGGTATGAAGCGTAG-3 ) and SA2 (5 -CGGGATCCTTATAGCGTCCTGTTAGTTTGTC-3 ).\n"," Indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) were performed as described previously [21] . PK-15 cells were grown on a 24-well plate and infected with the wtSPV and rSPV-SA at 1 × 10 8 PFU/ml per well. PBS-treated cells were used as a negative control. At 60 h post-infection, cells were washed three times in PBST and fixed with cold methanol for 10 min at −20 • C. Cells were then washed three times with PBST and blocked by PBST with 10% BSA. Preparations were incubated for 1 h at 37 • C with TGEV convalescent positive serum (1:1000 in dilution buffer, PBST with 1% BSA). After three washes with PBST, cells were treated with the rhodamineconjugated secondary antibody (Staphylococcal protein A-Rhod, Boshide, Wuhan, China) at a 1:5000 dilution (diluted in PBS) for 30 min at 37 • C. After a final wash with PBS, all wells were examined by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Germany).\n"," Nine six-week-old BALB/C mice were randomly divided into three groups (3 mice per group), and immunized three times at 0, 14, and 28 days with rSPV-SA (1 × 10 8 PFU/ml in 0.2 ml of PBS) or wtSPV (1 × 10 8 PFU/ml in 0.2 ml of PBS), the control group injected with PBS.\n"," Eight one-month-old swine (Large White) were randomly divided into four groups (2 pigs per group) and were immunized twice at 0 and 28 days with infectious rSPV-SA (1 × 10 8 PFU/ml in 2 ml of PBS), inactivated-TGEV (1 × 10 8 PFU/ml in 2 ml of PBS), wtSPV (1 × 10 8 PFU/ml in 2 ml of PBS) or PBS, each time via three routes: oral, nasal, and intraperitoneal. Serum was collected 14 days after the last immunization.\n"," Twelve one-day-old pigs were randomly divided into four groups for passive immunization experiments (3 pigs per group). High titers of antibodies were collected from piglets following the first immunization. Mice and swine serum were incubated at 56 • C 30 min to complement inactivated.\n"," All experimental protocols involving mice or swine were approved by the Laboratory Animal Monitoring Committee of Jiangsu Province.\n"," PK-15 cell monolayers were infected with wtSPV and rSPV-SA (moi of 5) and incubated for 72 h at 37 • C. Extracts, representing approximately 1 × 10 5 cells, were electrophoresed through an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel and the separated proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane. After a 2 h transfer, the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) overnight at 4 • C. The membrane was incubated with swine convalescent serum (1:1000 dilution) containing TGEV for 2 h at 37 • C and washed three times with PBST. Immunodetection was performed with staphy-lococcal protein A-HRP at 37 • C. Following the secondary antibody probing, the membrane was washed four times with PBST. The membrane was then developed with 3,3 -diaminoben-zidine substrate until optimal color development was observed.\n"," Serum was collected from mice and pigs, and detected the TGEV-specific antibodies by indirect ELISA. The purified TGEV was resuspended in 100 l PBS (pH 7.2), and used the best titer of virus for coating 96-well plates, which was determined by titration. Samples were then incubated overnight at 4 • C. This incubation was followed by three PBST washes, and blocking with 5% skim milk (in PBST) at 37 • C for 2 h. Serum samples were serially diluted and incubated at 37 • C for 1 h. The samples were set up at the same time and divided into three groups: the TGEV positive serum, the negative control serum (SPV positive serum) and the blank control (without serum). After three PBST washes, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-SPA IgG (1:10,000 diluted in PBST, Signalway Antibody) was added to each test well. The plates were then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min and then washed three times with PBST. The TMB microwell peroxidase substrate system (TIANGEN) was used to develop the reaction. Samples were developed for 20 min and the reaction terminated with 2.0 M sulphuric acid. All assays were performed in duplicate. A microplate reader (Bio-Rad) was used to measure the reaction product at an absorbance of 450 nm [22] .\n"," Evaluation of cellular immunity was performed by detecting levels of IFN-␥ and IL-4. Three mice were sacrificed at 30 days after the first inoculation with wtSPV (1 × 10 8 PFU/ml in 0.2 ml), PBS or rSPV-SA (1 × 10 8 PFU/ml in 0.2 ml). The mouse spleen was removed aseptically. Splenocytes were isolated, counted, and diluted to a density of 2 × 10 7 cells/100 l. The evenly separated cells were aliquot into 96-well plates (100 l/well). Then, 100 l/well of DMEM with 200 TCID 50 /100 l TGEV was added to each well. After a 60 h incubation, the supernatants were collected and the mRNA of IFN-␥ and IL-4 were probed by RT-qPCR relative to ␤-actin as described previously [23, 24] .\n"," An assay for neutralizing antibodies was performed as described previously [18, 19] . To explore whether mice or swine generated TGEV neutralizing antibodies, serum from the PBS, wtSPV, inactivated-TGEV and rSPV-SA treated mice and pig were collected at 0, 14, 21, 35, 42 days post-primary immunization (1:100-1:12,800 dilution in a 100 l volume). And sera were mixed with equal volume of 100 TCID 50 /ml TGEV and incubated at 37 • C. After 1.5 h incubation, we utilized sera treated viruses to infect ST cells in 96-well plates and overlaid cells with agar at 37 • C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Cells were monitored daily for three days to detect TGEV-specific CPE.\n"," The virulent TGEV strain SHXB (1 × 10 8 PFU/ml in 1 ml) was mixed with 3 ml of the porcine antiserum induced by recombinants rSPV-SA, inactivated TGEV or PBS, incubated at 37 • C for 60 min, and administered using a gastric tube to 2-day-old swine born from TGEV-seronegative sow. Inoculated animals were fed three times per day with formula for newborns that contained 3 ml of the antiserum. At three days following viral infection, small intestine tissue was collected from newborn pigs sectioned for histology. Microstructure characteristics were analyzed under the microscope (OLYMPUS, CX21FS1, Philippines) [25] .\n"," All data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.\n"," To analyse the recombinant virus and confirm the presence of the SA gene, two specific primers were designed to amplify the inserted SA gene. The gene encoding the neutralizing antigen epitopes of TGEV is a 0.5 kb fragment and the specific fragments was detected in SPV-SA as shown in Fig. 2A . The recombinant SPV-SA was also confirmed by observing blue foci in plaque assays. rSPV-SA and wtSPV were determined to be approximately 1 × 10 8 PFU/ml in 1 ml for both. As shown in Fig. 2B , the IFA demonstrated that the expression of the A epitope of the S protein was present in infected cells. Western blot analysis showed a specific band of target protein with a size of 19 kDa in the cell lysates infected with rSPV-SA (Fig. 2E) . The 19 kDa molecular weight is consistent with the predicted size of the SA protein of TGEV. According to these data, we suggested that the A epitope of the S protein was expressed efficiently by the rSPV-SA virus (Fig. 2) .\n"," To monitor the S-specific antibody titers of mice vaccinated with rSPV-SA, an ELISA was used. After an initial boost 7 days postvaccination, the S-A-specific antibody titers increased gradually in mice (Fig. 3A) . The antibody titers in rSPV-SA-immunized mice were higher at all-time points post-vaccination (P < 0.01, n = 5) compared to wtSPV or PBS-treated mice. The P/N value of the positive group was greater than 2.1. Persistent high levels of neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 4A) were detected in the rSPV-SA group with a mean titer of 1:1000 at 42 days post-inoculation.\n"," In mice vaccinated with wtSPV and rSPV-SA at 30 days postinoculation (Fig. 3B) , the qPCR results showed a distinct variation of IL-4 and IFN-␥ between wtSPV and rSPV-SA treatment groups. The relative quantity normalized by beta-actin of IL-4 mRNA in rSPV-SA was 1.47 times higher compared to wtSPV. The IFN-␥ mRNA levels increased 1.45 fold in rSPV-SA when compared to wtSPV. The concentrations of IL-4 and IFN-␥ in rSPV-SA-vaccinated mice were significantly higher than the control groups. These results indicate that rSPV-SA induces Th1-type and Th2-type cytokine responses during cellular immunity.\n"," During the vaccination procedure, several poxes of 2 mmϕ could be observed around the injection position at five days post-inoculation in both rSPV-SA and wtSPV treatment groups, respectively, which was not observed in the inactivated-TGEV and PBS treatment groups. This symptom could be disappeared spontaneously in the following 5 days. No pigs developed further symptoms such as fever or severe inflammation, and the spiritual condition and appetite of both treatment groups was considered as good. These two group pigs recovered in 14 days. All group pigs maintained rectal temperatures of 38.7-39.3 • C. From this experiment, we reveal that vaccination with rSPV-SA and wtSPV is well tolerated by pigs.\n"," rSPV-SA induced a moderate level of TGEV-specific IgG as shown in Fig. 5 . Persistent high levels of TGEV-specific neutralizing antibodies are shown in Fig. 4b . The second boost led to of the levels of TGEV-specific neutralizing antibodies. Persistent high levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in the rSPV-SA group at a mean titer of 1:1400 in swine (P < 0.05, n = 5).\n"," All newborn piglets in different groups were fed with the mixture of TGEV and the corresponding sera from pigs vaccinated with PBS, wtSPV, inactivated-TGEV, or rSPV-SA. Both PBS and wtSPV treatment groups developed a very severe diarrhea symptom, significantly losing of weight and appetite, and the mortality rate was up to 100% in 3 days. Meanwhile, in the inactivated-TGEV and rSPV-SA treatment groups, there was no obvious clinical symptoms and 0% morality rate observed (Fig. 6 . and Table 1 ). After the sacrificing of all the piglets, the small intestine tissue from different groups were used for the pathological examination. Histological samples from PBS and wtSPV treatment groups showed prominent histopathological changes in the small intestine characterized by serious fracture of the small intestine mucosa, epithelial expansion, vacuolar degeneration, necrosis, shedding, and lamina propria congestive edema and hemorrhage. And such pathological changes were not observed during the examination of the samples from inactivated-TGEV and rSPV-SA treatment groups. All the results indicate that rSPV-SA inoculation provides complete protection passive immunity against TGEV challenge in pigs (Fig. 7) .\n"," In the present study, we have engineered the swinepox virus to express the A epitope of the TGEV S protein. Our data showed that this recombinant virus was not only able to induce a strong immune response against the A antigen of TGEV in mice and pigs, but also had safety degree and protection efficacy against the virulent homologous TGEV infection in pigs. The traditional way to protect swine from TGEV infection is to immunize pregnant sows with inactivated or attenuated vaccine, resulting in the production of Secretory IgA in the colostrum. Despite the protection that Secretory IgA offers piglets, this method does not provide protection after the cessation of breastfeeding. Furthermore, inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines still maintain the ability of developing the viral toxicity [26] . Currently, there are various potential vaccines against TGEV but many present certain challenges, such as difficulties in the vaccination process, high production cost, low immunogenicity, biological risk and carcinogenicity.\n"," The results from our experiments indicate that the rSPV-SA vaccine is a very promising candidate in the safety and immunogenicity respect. However, it should be noticed that, as an alive viral vector vaccine, it is possible that the SPV per se would interfere the vaccination. To evaluate this possibility, 2000 randomly sampled pig sera were tested via the agarose gel diffusion assay, and the results showed the SPV positive rate was around 1%. Moreover, there was no report of SPV epidemic in these recent years. Thus, together with gel diffusion assay, the interfering from SPV per se could be considered as minimum.\n"," For the first time, we generated a recombinant SPV that expresses the neutralizing epitopes (A epitope in Protein S) of TGEV, and we verified that the S-A was expressed efficiently in our system. The antigen induced neutralizing antibodies against TGEV in ST cells, and potentiated strong TH1-type and TH2-type cytokine responses in our mouse model. These results suggest that rSPV-SA induces humoral and cellular immune responses effectively and efficiently. Given the Th1 cell secretion of IL-2, IFN-␥, IFN-␣, and TFN-␤, it is apparent that Th1 cells play an important role in antiintracellular pathogenic infection. Because Th2 cells in our study secreted IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10, it is likely that these cells were able to effectively stimulate B cell proliferation and hence, IgG and IgE antibody production (relevant to humoral immunity). We defined IFN-␥ and IL-4 to be representative of the Th1-type and Th2-type cytokine secretory capacity, respectively. Our results indicate that in our hands, both Th1-type and Th2-type cytokine levels increased dramatically.\n"," Due to the immature immune system, the maternal antibodies from breast milk account for the immune defensive ability of piglets. Based on the feasibility and relevant published papers [25] , we decided to mimic the breast milk from female pig by mixing the anti-serum generated by vaccinating the 30 days old piglets with SPV-SA and the normal cow milk, and use it for passive immunity protection test on the 1days old piglets. In the study, the recombinant SPV vectors were capable of protecting neonatal piglets against mortality and severe disease after a challenge with virus. The rSPV-SA vector induced high titers of antibodies in swine. However it is worth noting that rSPV-SA may enhance the anti-TGEV antibody titer in swine as well as the anti-SPV antibody, which will likely affect immune efficiency. With respect to clinical value, it is imperative to study this multivalent vaccine.\n"," To summarize, we first report that SPV can be used as a live vector vaccine when it expresses the S-A protein of TGEV. We determined that not only B-cells, but also T-cells were induced successfully. Thus, rSPV-SA provides thorough protection against virulent TGEV challenge in swine. Lastly, our data indicate that rSPV-SA is a promising vaccine to prevent TGEV infection.\n","Score: 3.4900107591953646\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof Arginine Methylation of SARS-Cov-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Regulates RNA Binding, its Ability to Suppress Stress Granule Formation and Viral Replication Arginine Methylation of SARS-Cov-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Regulates RNA Binding, its Ability to Suppress Stress Granule Formation and Viral Replication Running title: PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 N protein\n","Body Text: The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus which belongs to the family coronaviridae of genus betacoronavirus and has a positive sense strand RNA genome of ~30 kb [1] . It contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) and encodes four structural proteins, namely spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as well as nine accessory proteins [1] . ORF1a and ORF1b are further processed to generate 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16). Among the viral proteins, N protein is the most abundant in the virions and is expressed at the highest levels in infected cells [2] . Thus, its abundance, essential roles during infection, and immunogenic nature, makes the SARS-CoV-2 N protein a valuable target for developing new strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic [3] [4] [5] .\n"," N protein regulates different steps of the coronavirus life cycle [2] . The primary role of betacoronavirus N protein is the packaging of the viral genome into helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes [6] . It is also involved in RNA synthesis with components of the replicase at early stages of infection [7, 8] . Betacoronavirus N protein has two conserved and independently folded structural domains, called the N-terminal RNA-binding domain and C-terminal dimerization domain (NTD, CTD) [4, 9, 10] , separated by flexible intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at the N-terminus, central serine/arginine-rich (SR) linker region, and C-terminal tail, respectively. The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD RNA binding domain depicts a U-shaped β-platform containing five short β-strands and an extended hairpin, forming a palm and finger-like structure with a highly positively charged cleft [4, 11] .\n"," After viral infection, host cells generate stress granules (SG) as an anti-viral response to inhibit protein synthesis and induce innate immune signaling [12, 13] . SARS-CoV N protein plays an important role in host-virus interaction and localizes to cytoplasmic SGs [14] . The SG nucleating factor G3BP1 [15, 16] and other SG components were identified in the SARS-CoV-2 N protein interactome [5, 17] , suggesting SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV regulates SGs mainly through N protein. The SARS-CoV-2 N protein is able to form condensates with RNA in vitro [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , in the cytoplasm of cells [21, 25] and partially co-localizes within arsenite-induced SGs [26] . Several studies have shown that N protein sequesters G3BP1 and disassembles SGs [22, [26] [27] [28] , likely as a means to suppress the host immune response to favor virus replication. Recent studies show that IDR1 and NTD regulate N protein condensates affecting nucleic acid annealing and potentially implicated in viral packaging and assembly [21, 22, 25] . The SR linker region is phosphorylated by SRPK [29] , GSK-3 [30] and Cdk1-GSK3 [18] , influencing N protein condensates [18, 22] . Besides phosphorylation, post-translational modifications that regulate N function are not known.\n"," We identify that SARS-CoV-2 N protein contains five undefined and uncharacterized RGG/RG motifs. RGG/RG motifs are prevalent in RBPs and play key roles in mediating protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions [31, 32] . The arginine residues located within the RGG/RG motifs are the preferred sites of methylation by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) [33] . In mammals, there are nine PRMTs (PRMT1-9) that are classified into three types based on the methylmarks they produce: N G -monomethylarginine (MMA), p 4 asymmetric N G , N G -dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric N G , N´G dimethylarginine (SDMA) [33] . Methylarginines are bound by Tudor domains which are methylarginine readers [34] . Arginine methylation regulates proteinprotein interactions and protein-nucleic acid interactions to influence basic cellular processes, including transcription, RNA processing including pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, and mRNA translation, signaling transduction and liquid-liquid phase separation [35, 36] . Unlike lysine demethylation, dedicated arginine demethylases have not been identified [36] . Many specific small molecule inhibitors of PRMTs have been generated for cancer therapeutics [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] and a few have entered clinical trials (for review see [36] ).\n"," Arginine methylation is known to methylate host and viral proteins necessary for viral replication. For example, the arginine methylation of HIV Tat protein decreases its transactivation function [43] . The inhibition of PRMT5 prevents host hnRNPA1 RGG/RG motif methylation and inhibits HIV-1 and HTLV-1 IRES function [44] . Moreover, PRMT5 methylates hepatitis B virus core (HBc) protein within its C-terminal arginine-rich domain to regulate its cellular localization [45] . Arginine methylation of prototype foamy virus Gag in its glycine arginine rich box by PRMT1 regulates its nucleolar localization during replication [46] .\n"," In the present study, we report that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 N protein within its RGG/RG motifs to regulate the RNA binding activity of the N protein towards its 5'-UTR genomic RNA. Moreover, arginine methylation modulates the role of N protein to inhibit SG formation. Our findings show for the first time that inhibition of type I PRMTs decreased SARS-CoV N methylation within virions and that arginine methylation is required for viral production.\n"," We noted that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein harbors two RGG ( Figure 1A ) and three RG motifs like SARS-CoV, but unlike MERS-CoV. As RGG/RG motifs are preferred sites of PRMT1, PRMT5 and PRMT6 [31] , we tested whether they could be methylated. We first expressed and purified glutathione Stransferase (GST)-fusion proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein fragments (GST-N 1-150, GST-N 150-262 and GST-N 263-419, Figure 1A ) and performed in vitro arginine methylation assays. Both the Nterminal fragment (amino acid residues 1-150) and the central region (amino acid residues 150-262) were arginine methylated by PRMT1 ( Figure 1B ). By contrast, the N protein fragments were not methylated by PRMT5 or PRMT6 ( Figure 1C and 1D). We then substituted arginines in the RGG/RG motifs to lysines to identify the methylated sites and maintain the charge. Mutation of arginine 68 (R68K) in the N-terminal fragment had no significant effect on arginine methylation, while mutation of arginine 95 (R95K) completely abolished PRMT1 methylation ( Figure 1E ), suggesting that R95 was the methylated residue in the GST-N 1-150 fragment. Similarly, mutation analysis identified R177 as the methylated residue in the central fragment ( Figure 1F ). Taken together, R95 and R177 within the RGG/RG motifs of the SARS-CoV-2 N were methylated in vitro by PRMT1.\n"," We then determined whether the SARS-CoV-2 N protein was methylated in cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing Flag-epitope N protein (Flag-N). The cells were lysed and the N protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies and its methylation detected by western blotting using the ASYM26 antibody which specifically recognizes asymmetrically dimethylated arginine (ADMA) residues within RGG/RG motifs. Importantly, the asymmetrical dimethylarginine methylation of the Flag-N protein (N-me2) was significantly reduced by treatment of the cells with the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 ( Figure 1G ) and transfection with siPRMT1 ( Figure 1H ).\n"," We next monitored patient data to identify modulation of PRMT1 expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples from 19 clinically well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 patients and five healthy controls was performed [47] . Importantly, analysis of their data showed that PRMT1 was significantly upregulated in infected patients ( Figure S1 ). These data suggest PRMT1 may play a role during the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.\n"," We then performed mass spectrometry analysis to identify SARS-CoV-2 Ninteracting proteins in the absence or presence of MS023. Flag-tagged SARS-CoV-2 N protein was expressed in HEK293 cells and a pull-down performed using anti-Flag affinity resin. Co-purified cellular proteins were subsequently analyzed by affinity-purification liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (AP-LC-MS/MS). We identified 119 cellular proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 N protein (peptide count > 2, fold change >2 between Flag-N and empty vector-transfected, 0.1% FDR, Figure 2A and B, Supplementary Dataset 1). Importantly, we identified several protein components of stress granule (SG) such as G3BP1 and G3BP2 (Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3-domainbinding protein 1 and 2) [48] , and CAPRIN1 (Figure 2A ), in line with previous published AP-MS/MS studies [5, 17] . Moreover, our J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f p 6 mass spectrometry analysis identified SRSF protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) and GSK-3, known to phosphorylate N protein and regulate its localization to SGs [18, 22, 29] . We also identified TRIM25 as a top hit in the N protein interactome. As a K63-linked ubiquitin ligase, TRIM25 mediates retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) ubiquitination and activates TLR/RLR signaling pathway in response to RNA virus infection. It is known that SARS-CoV N protein interacts with TRIM25 and inhibits TRIM25/RIG-I association [49] , suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 N protein may play a similar role in antagonizing the host immune response.\n"," We then performed biological process (Gene Ontology) analysis using the identified interaction partners to assess major cellular pathways. The top 10 pathways enriched consisted of RNA metabolic processes ( Figure  S2 ). Interestingly, many SARS-CoV-2 Ninteracting proteins (27 of 119, Figure 2B ) contained multiple RGG/RG motifs including DEAD/DExH family of RNA helicases DDX21, DDX54, DHX30, DHX57, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins hnRNPA1, A3, D, DL, G (RBMX), R, U, UL1 and UL2 ( Table 1 ). Many of these N-interacting proteins, such as G3BP1 [50] , FAM98A [51] , FXR1 [52] , hnRNPA1 [53] , hnRNPUL1 [54] , SYNCRIP [55] , ILF3 [56] , and SERBP1 [57] are known PRMT1 substrates. N protein-interactome changed significantly by two proteins with MS023 treatment. Interaction between N protein and HMGB2 was lost and interaction with PRMT1 was gained with MS023 treatment ( Figure 2C ). HMGB2 is a paralog of HMBG1 shown to play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 replication [58] . Interestingly, the AP-MS/MS analysis identified eleven PRMT1 peptides covering 30% of the protein sequence in the Flag-N immunoprecipitation from MS023-treated cells and none in non-treated cells ( Figure  2C ). These data are consistent with MS023 being non-competitive with type I PRMT substrates [37] . To confirm these interactions, HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-N and treated with DMSO control or MS023. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitations performed with anti-Flag antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-PRMT1, -G3BP1 or -SARS-CoV2 N protein antibodies. Indeed, Flag-N immunoprecipitations showed increased PRMT1 association with MS023 treatment and G3BP1 was observed in immunoprecipitations from treated and non-treated cells ( Figure 2D , compare lanes 5 and 6). These data confirm interactions between the N protein and G3BP1 and PRMT1.\n"," Stress granules are frequently observed upon infection with DNA or RNA viruses, serving an antiviral function [12, 13] . Recent studies reveal that SARS-CoV-2 N protein is associated with SGs and regulates their dynamics [22, [26] [27] [28] . To investigate whether arginine methylation regulates the property of SARS-CoV-2 N protein to suppress SG formation and dynamics, we monitored SG formation using anti-G3BP1 antibodies in the hepatoma Huh-7, a cell line frequently used in the study of SARS-CoV-2. Huh-7 cells transfected with an empty plasmid (pcDNA) or a plasmid expressing Flag-N protein were treated with a milddose of oxidative stress (0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 1h) or a harsh-dose (1 mM sodium arsenite for 2h). 3A), as reported recently [22, [26] [27] [28] . Interestingly, at the mild-doses of 0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 1 h, 25.89±2.56% of Flag-N protein transfected cells had G3BP1 SGs compared to 70.08±1.93% in the pcDNA transfected cells ( Figure 3B ), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 N protein suppresses G3BP1 SG formation. As regulating SGs formation is an important function for viral replication and host cell immune response [13] , we focused our study on how arginine methylation was implicated in N protein mediated SG suppression. Thus, all subsequent studies were performed with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 1 h to study N protein inhibition of G3BP1 SGs. Huh-7 cells transfected with Flag-N protein were treated with type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 or control DMSO before induction of SGs with sodium arsenite. Methyltransferase inhibition using MS023 significantly increased the presence of Flag-N expressing cells with G3BP1 SGs (45.48±4.79% versus 30.99±3.92% ), while no significant change was observed in the non-transfected cells with over >70% of the cells with SGs ( Figure 3C ). PRMT1 inhibition in HeLa cells is known to increase the number of SGs per cell via RGG/RG motif methylation of G3BP1 [50] and UBAP2L [59] . To demonstrate the role of arginine methylation suppression of G3BP1 SGs was due to N protein methylation, per se, we transfected Huh-7 cells with wild type and R-K Flag-N proteins and monitored SGs. Cells with N protein with R95K or R95K/R177K substitution showed increased SG formation in comparison to those transfected with Flag-N or Flag-N R177K ( Figure 4A , R95K 35.82±3.03%, R177K 26.74±2.52%, R95K/R177K 36.62±2.78% versus wild type N 25.30±2.62%). These findings show that the methylation of N protein at R95, but not R177, is required for the SARS-CoV-2 N to suppress G3BP1-positive SGs.\n"," We next examined whether the ectopic expression of a methylarginine reader could also interfere with N protein-mediated of G3BP1 SGs. The Tudor domain is a known reader of methylated arginine residues [34] . We first examined whether Flag-N protein associated with ectopically expressed Tudor domain-containing proteins SMN and TDRD3 by coimmunoprecipitation assays. Indeed, a strong interaction between Flag-N protein and TDRD3 was observed, whereas the interaction with SMN was weaker, as visualized by immunoblotting ( Figure 4B ). Next, we tested whether TDRD3 influenced N protein-mediated SG regulation, as it is known that TDRD3 localizes to SGs [60, 61] . We co-transfected increasing amounts of expression plasmid encoding TDRD3 together with Flag-N protein and visualized the presence of arsenite-induced G3BP1 SGs. We observed an increase in G3BP1 SGs with increase expression of TDRD3 with N protein ( Figure 4C ). These findings suggest that an increasing the methylreader TDRD3 expression could be a means to quench the effects of N protein on SG regulation.\n"," N is an RNA binding protein that binds the 5'-UTR of its viral genomic RNA for viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) formation and packaging into virions [62, 63] . The SARS-CoV-2 N protein R95 and R177 are located in the NTD domain and at NTD-SR linker boundary, respectively. Actually, R95 and R177 are within the RNA binding site of the NTD with R177 being predicted to be implicated in N protein RNA binding [4, 11, 64] . Therefore, we reasoned that these arginines and their methylation were likely involved in the RNA binding activity of N protein. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with Flag-N and an expression vector J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f p 8 transcribing ~400 bp of the 5'-UTR RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (p5'-UTR:CoV-2; Figure 5A ). Initially, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) to monitor N protein RNA binding activity. We observed a >5-fold enrichment with anti-Flag antibodies in the DMSO treated cells versus MS023 treated cells ( Figure 5A ). These data suggest that inhibition of type I PRMTs prevent the binding of Flag-N to the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Next, we wished to confirm that this N protein/RNA interaction was direct by performing a photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) assay [65] . Cells transfected with Flag-N or Flag-N harboring R95K, R177K, R95K/R177K and p5'-UTR:CoV-2 were labeled with 4thiouridine and UV cross-linked. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies following a 'Clipping' step with RNase A. RNA was purified and analyzed by RT-qPCR with two sets of primers against the 5'-UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (position #1 and #2). Using this strategy, we showed that Flag-N directly binds to the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA ( Figure 5B ). Importantly, both the single R95K and R177K or the double R95K/R177K substitution of N protein abolished RNA binding activity ( Figure 5B ). Immunoblotting was performed to confirm an equal expression of wild type N protein and the R-K proteins immunoprecipitated of the four replicates ( Figure 5C ). Taken together, these results suggest that arginine methylation of both R95 and R177 of the N protein is a requirement for association with its viral RNA in cellulo.\n"," We then studied the effect of type I PRMT inhibitor MS0233 on SARS-CoV-2 replication. First, we performed MS023 toxicity assays with VeroE6 cells, a cell line highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We confirmed that cell proliferation was not affected at concentrations of MS023 up to 30 µM in complete medium ( Figure 6A ). Next in a certified SARS-CoV-2 BL3 laboratory, we then treated VeroE6 cells with 10 µM or 20 µM MS023, versus DMSO control, for 24 h and proceeded with SARS-CoV-2 infection at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI=0.1). The infected cells were kept in MS023 containing medium for another two days. Supernatant from each, infected well was collected and the virus inactivated with TRIzol to assay SARS-CoV-2 titer by Taqman real-time PCR assay. We observed a significant reduction of viral titer when the cells were incubated with 20 µM MS023 and an intermediate viral titer was observed with 10 µM MS023 ( Figure 6B ).\n"," From the TRIzol organic phase, we extracted the viral proteins and separated them by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-SARS-CoV-2 S, and N protein or anti-methylarginine ASYM26 antibodies. We observed a slight decrease (~20-30%) in the total amounts of S and N proteins with MS023 treatment ( Figure 6C ), consistent with overall decrease in virions of ( Figure 6B) . Notably, the anti-ASYM26 antibodies revealed a ~50% reduction in N protein arginine methylation, when normalized to N protein levels ( Figure  6C , middle panel). In contrast, we could not detect methylation of S with ASYM26 antibody ( Figure 6C ), likely due to the lack of RGG/RG motifs in S protein sequence. These findings show that the SARS-CoV-2 production is reduced in the presence of type I PRMT inhibitors and that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is arginine methylated within the virions.\n"," In the present manuscript, we identify SARS-CoV-2 N protein to be arginine methylated within virions. We show that methylation of the N protein is mediated by PRMT1 at R95 within the NTD and R177 at the NTD/SR linker boundary. Both residues are within RGG/RG motifs conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Amino acid substitutions R95K or R177K inhibited N protein RNA binding in cellulo to SARS-CoV-2 5'-UTR genomic RNA using a CLIP assay in HEK293 cells. The ectopic expression of N protein in Huh-7 cells was localized to cytoplasmic granules and inhibition of G3BP1 stress granule (SG) formation was observed. Notably, arginine methylation of N protein at R95 by PRMT1 was necessary for this function. The N protein interactome was defined to contain many known PRMT1 substrates with RGG/RG motifs. Treatment with the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 did not influence the overall N interactome, but PRMT1 was identified as a new interactor, consistent with a substrate-enzyme interaction in the presence of the non-competitive inhibitor MS023 [37] . Importantly, inhibition of arginine methylation with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in VeroE6 cells. Our findings define arginine methylation as new mode of interfering with N protein regulation of SGs and define PRMT1 as a requirement for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. As type I PRMT inhibitors are in clinical trials for cancer treatment [41] , these compounds may also be useful to target SARS-CoV-2 replication.\n"," Host proteins and enzymes are needed for the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and many of these were identified using CRISPR screens [58, [66] [67] [68] [69] . Factors required for early viral entry and fusion, and components of the endosome and cholesterol pathways were identified [66] [67] [68] . Few components, however, were identified that target the later phases of the viral life cycle, such as vRNP formation, phase separation for genome packaging, encapsidation and assembly of virions. A recent study identified ~50 host RBPs binding SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and the knockdown of some of these RBPs inhibited viral replication [70] . As SARS-CoV-2 N protein and cellular RBPs are substrates of PRMT1 [31] , our findings suggest that type I PRMT inhibitors or increasing methylarginine readers may regulate N function in vRNP packaging and assembly into virions. Notably, the increased expression of PRMT1 in nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [47] is consistent with PRMT1 being a host factor required for the virus.\n"," SARS-CoV-2 viral protein extracts immunoblotted with ASYM26 revealed the arginine methylation of the N protein. It is known that the N protein is highly immunogenic and anti-N antibodies are amongst the first to appear in infected individuals [71] . It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 N protein is fully methylated in infected cells, thus epitopes from the methylated RGG/RG peptides of N protein likely contribute to its elevated immunogenicity. Notably, R95-and R177-derived SARS-CoV-2 N peptides are predicted to be B cell epitopes [72, 73] . Moreover, R95-and R177-peptides from the N protein were used to design SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in India [72] , and we propose that the incorporation of asymmetrical dimethylarginines would increase their immunogenicity. Although our mass spectrometry significantly covered 74% of the N protein, the R95 was not covered and R177 was covered, but the peptides were unmethylated. Interestingly, the only variant in N protein is R203K;G204R in the B.1.17 strain and T205I in B.1.351 strain, suggesting the RGT sequence is an important regulatory site.\n"," The absence of methylation of the S protein observed using anti-ASYM26 is likely due to the lack of RGG/RG motifs. However, the S protein harbors an RRXR sequence within its furin cleavage site, a potential methylation sequence for PRMT7 [74] . Thus, mass spectrometry analysis and various anti-methylarginine antibodies targeting MMA and SDMA will be needed to further define the sites of arginine methylation within the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins.\n"," Coronaviruses, like other viruses, have devised strategies to destabilize and inhibit SG formation to ensure optimal viral replication. The infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) uses endoribonuclease Nsp15 for SG interference [75] . For MERS-CoV, it is the 4a accessory protein that inhibits SG formation [76, 77] . The N protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were shown to localize to SGs [14, 22, [26] [27] [28] . Thus, targeting the N protein function in G3BP1 SG regulation represents a new and valid strategy to fight COVID-19. It is known that the SR linker region when phosphorylated renders the N protein condensate more liquid-like and inhibition of N protein phosphorylation favors its translocation to SGs [14, 18, 25, 29, 30, 78, 79] . We now show that arginine methylation of N protein is a post-translational modification that tunes N protein regulation of G3BP1 SGs. Information about how SGs are formed and regulated is emerging and represents a combination of multivalent interactions of protein-protein, protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions [80] . How does arginine methylation of N protein regulate SG formation? Both R95K and R177K were defective in RNA binding to the SARS-CoV-2 5'-UTR RNA, and yet only R95K within the NTD was required for SG regulation. Our observation is in agreement with a recent report that residues 1-175 of N protein are sufficient to disrupt SGs [26] .\n"," Consistent with R95 and R177 being part of the U-shaped β-platform of the RNA binding domain [4, 11] , we show that both residues are needed to bind the 5'-UTR where the putative viral packaging signal of the genomic RNA resides. It is possible that N protein R177 is not needed to associate non-specifically with host mRNAs and hence its substitution to lysine does not influence SGs. Thus, we propose that RGG/RG motif methylation of the N protein affects SGs by modulating interaction with methylreaders and RNA.\n"," The N interactome was not significantly altered in the presence of MS023, but there was an increase in PRMT1 association. We noted that increasing the concentration of a methylarginine reader TDRD3 blocked N protein from suppressing SG formation. Therefore, we propose that MS023 besides inhibiting the activity of PRMT1, also inactivates N protein by increasing its interaction with PRMT1, therefore allowing PRMT1 to become an enzyme-inactive RGG/RG motif reader. A role for arginine methylation of the RGG/RG motif in RBP phase separation is known [32, 36] . For example, the RGG/RG motif protein FUS, dysregulated in ALS, undergoes liquidliquid phase separation in the absence of PRMT1 [81, 82] . Thus, arginine methylation is a key regulator of RNP condensation. As type I PRMT GSK3368715 inhibitor is in phase I clinical trials for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [41] , our data suggest that these inhibitors may be an effective strategy to interfere with N protein condensation and influence late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.\n"," Arginine methylation influences nearby phosphorylation sites often being antagonistic [36] . For example, arginine methylation of the FOXO1 transcription factor at R248 and R250 by PRMT1 prevents AKT phosphorylation at S253, blocking nuclear exclusion of FOXO1 [83] .\n"," Arginine methylation of cytoplasmic tail of the epidermal growth factor receptor at R1175 by PRMT5 enhances its transautophosphorylation at Y1173 [84] . N protein RNA binding activity is known to be regulated by phosphorylation. In vitro studies showed that hypophosphorylation of the N protein facilitated interaction with RNA [22] . We show that methylation of N protein R95 and R177 is needed for RNA binding. As S176, S180, S183, and S184 are reported to be phosphorylated by SRPK1 [29] and GSK3-Cdk1 [18, 30, 78] , it is likely that there will be an interplay between phosphorylation and methylation especially near R177 for binding to the 5'-UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. It is likely that optimal binding of N protein to the 5'-UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA will require a balance of methylarginines and phosphoserines. This interplay may also influence interactions with methylreaders including TDRD3 and phosphoreaders such as 14-3-3 proteins, the latter shown to bind the N protein [85] .\n"," In sum, our findings suggest that arginine methylation is required for N protein function, and PRMT1 is an essential regulator implicated in SARS-CoV2 life cycle. As PRMT inhibitors are in clinical trials [36] , they may have applications for COVID-19, in addition to them being promising cancer drug candidates.\n"," Immunoblotting was performed using the following antibodies: mouse anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (F1804, Sigma Aldrich, 1:2000); rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 N antibody (9103, Prosci, 1:2000); rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody (PA5-81795, Invitrogen, 1:1000); rabbit anti-TDRD3 antibody (Bethyl Laboratory, 1:1000); mouse anti-SMN antibody (610646, BD Biosciences, 1:2000); rabbit anti-G3BP1 antibody (1F1, Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, 1:1000, a kind gift from Dr. Imed Gallouzi at McGill University) [86] ; rabbit anti-ASYM26 (13-0011, Epicypher, 1:1000).

Huh-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Non-Essential Amino Acid (NEAA, Gibco) and grown at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with 20 nM siRNA oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 and Huh-7 cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs by standard calcium phosphate precipitation and Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen), respectively.\n"," The N-terminal Flag-tagged SARS-CoV-2 N plasmid was constructed by inserting a Flag-coding sequence into the pcDNA3.1 (+) vector at the Hind III and Bam HI sites to generate pcDNA3.1-Flag and then the PCR-amplified cDNA of SARS-CoV-2 N coding region at Bam HI and Xho I sites of pcDNA3.1-Flag vector. The PCR template DNA is a plasmid with insertion of synthesized DNA expressing SARS-CoV-2 N protein provided by Dr. Shan Cen based on the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (GenBank: MN_908947). The plasmids for expressing GST fusion proteins of SARS-CoV-2 N truncated fragments were constructed by inserting PCRamplified SARS-CoV-2 N cDNA fragments in pGEX-6P1 vector at Bam HI and Sal I sites. The GST-RGG construct was generated by inserting a DNA fragment expressing the mouse RBMX C-terminal RGG/RG motif in pGEX-6P1 vector at Bam HI and Sal I sites. The mutants with replacement of the arginine residues with lysine at the RGG/RG motif were constructed by a two-step PCR strategy. p5'-UTR:CoV-2 was constructed using synthesized DNA fragment with the 1-400 bp of 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA (NC_045512) and the DNA fragment was insert into pcDNA3.1 vector at Bam HΙ and Xba Ι sites. The myc-tagged SMN and TDRD3 plasmids were generated in previous studies [87, 88] . All siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon. siRNA sequences are as follows: siPRMT1, 5'-CGT CAA AGC CAA CAA GTT AUU-3'. The siRNA 5′-CGU ACG CGG AAU ACU UCG AdTdT-3′, targeting the firefly luciferase (GL2) was used as control. 20 nM siRNA was used for transfection.\n"," Expression of GST fusion proteins in bacteria was induced with 1mM isopropyl-β-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at room temperature for 16 h. All steps of the purification after growth of bacteria were performed at 4°C. Cells were lysed by sonication in PBS buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h. The resin was washed four times with PBS buffer and then twice with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4 buffer. Protein was eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer. Approximately 10 µg of each GST fusion protein was incubated with 1 µl of (methyl-3 H) S-adenosyl-L-methionine solution (15Ci/mmol stock solution, 0.55 µM final concentration, Perkin-Elmer) and 1-2 µg of PRMTs in methylation buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT) for 1 to 4 h at 25°C or 37°C.

Cell lysates were cleared with high-speed centrifugation to remove cell debris, then the supernatant was incubated with anti-Flag M2 beads for 1.5 h at 4ºC. Samples were washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer for 3 times and eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer for western blot analysis. For LC-MS/MS, the beads were further washed with PBS buffer twice. The beads together with the bound proteins were subjected to LC-MS/MS.\n"," For FLAG-N proteomic analysis, peptides were reconstituted in water containing 0.2% formic acid and analyzed by nanoflow-LC-MS/MS using an Orbitrap Fusion Mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Proxeon Easy-nLC 1000. Samples were injected on a 150 µm, ~ 20 cm nano-LC column (Jupiter C18, 3 µm, 300 Å, Phenomenex). The separation was performed with a linear gradient from 5 to 30% ACN and 0.2% formic acid over 56 min at 600nL/min. Full MS scans were acquired from m/z 350 to m/z 1200 at resolution 120,000 at m/z 200, with a target automatic gain control (AGC) of 5E5 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms.

Precursor and fragment tolerances were set at 10 ppm and 0.01 Da respectively. Carbamidomethylation (C) was selected as fixed modification. Phosphorylation (STY), deamidation (NQ) and oxidation (M) were selected as variable modifications.\n"," Prior to performing viral infections, the MS023 inhibitor was examined for toxicity to the VeroE6 cells. VeroE6 cells (2,500 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plate and cultured at a condition similar to that in the viral infection analysis. The type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 was dissolved in DMSO and diluted in complete DMEM containing 10% FBS. The medium was p 14 added to cells with a final concentration of 2 to 30 µM MS023 and 0.2% DMSO as indicated. Twenty-four hours later, the cell culture medium was replaced with 2% FBS/DMEM medium containing the same concentration of MS023 and DMSO in the corresponding wells. After 48 h of further incubation, the cell viability was analyzed using the MTT assay kit (Abcam, ab211091) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the media was carefully removed, and both 50 µl of serum-free medium and 50 µl of MTT reagent were added to each well. Following 3 h of incubation at 37°C, the MTT reagent was removed and 150 µl of MTT solvent was added to each well and the plate was incubated at room temperature on an orbital shaker for 30 min prior to reading absorbance at OD 590 nm. The absorbance of MS023-treated wells was divided by the absorbance of the DMSO-treated wells to normalize cell survival.\n"," Within the certified BL3 containment facility of the McGill University Health Centre, VeroE6 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (10 5 /well in 0.5 ml) and incubated in complete DMEM containing 10% FBS in the presence of PRMT1 inhibitor MS023 or DMSO control for 24 h prior to infection. The cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate RIM-1 (GenBank accession number: MW599736) at multiplicity of infection (MOI=0.1) at 37°C for 2h. The virus inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed once with 2% FBS/DMEM medium and then incubated for an additional 48 h in 1 ml of 2% FBS/DMEM containing the PRMT inhibitor at indicated concentrations or same amount of DMSO as control at 37°C. After the infection was complete, 250 µl cell supernatant was lysed in 0.75 ml TRIzol LS (Invitrogen) and transported out of the BL3 facility. The viral RNA was then extracted from the TRIzol using chloroform extraction following manufacturer's instructions. One step RT-qPCR was performed using TaqMan™ Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix following the manufacturer's instructions. Viral gRNA was detected using primers (Fw: 5'-ATG AGC TTA GTC CTG TTG-3', Rv: 5'-CTC CCT TTG TTG TGT TGT-3'), and probe (5'Hex-AGA TGT CTT GTG CTG CCG GTA-BHQ-1-3'), specifically targeting RdRp gene as described [89] . In addition, viral proteins were extracted from the organic phase of TRIzol solution according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, after removing the aqueous phase, 0.3 ml 100% ethanol was added to the organic phase. Genomic RNA (gRNA) from infected cells was pelleted by centrifugation at 2000g for 5 min. 0.75 ml supernatant was moved to a new tube and mixed with 1.5 ml isopropanol.

A common characteristic shared by reoviruses as well as many other dsRNA viruses is that their inner capsid contains several copies of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) and mRNA-capping enzymes, and the process of reoviral positive-strand (+) RNA (mRNA) transcription from minus-strand (À) RNA, followed by mRNA capping, takes place within the reoviral inner capsid (1, 2) . The nascently synthesized and capped (+)RNA is then released into the cytoplasm of infected cells for protein translation. After that, reoviral (+)RNAs are encapsidated into newly assembled inner capsids, and are used by RdRPs as templates to synthesize genomic dsRNA segments within reoviral inner capsids (1, 3, 4) . Thus, unlike most single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, reoviruses use their inner capsids as the machinery for viral RNA (vRNA) synthesis and the shield for evading host antiviral defenses (1, 2, 4) .\n"," Cypovirus (cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus, CPV), which contains 10 genomic dsRNA segments, is one of the 15 genera within the family Reoviridae and is further classified into 16 types (cypovirus 1-16) based on the electrophoretic migration profiles of their genome segments (5) (http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp?version= 2012). And the CPV particles are embedded in polyhedra for surviving unfavorable external environment (6) .\n"," *To whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel: +86 27 68756654; Fax: +86 27 68754941; Email: zhouxi@whu.edu.cn Unlike other multishelled reoviruses, cypovirus is the simplest genus of the family Reoviridae because it has only a single-layered capsid (7) , and this characteristic makes it an ideal and simplified model for studying the mRNA/dsRNA synthesis and mRNA-capping mechanisms of reoviruses and probably other dsRNA viruses (8) . For this reason, extensive molecular and structural studies have focused on CPVs in recent years (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate the segmented dsRNA genome replication of CPVs and other reoviruses is still limited.\n"," The CPV capsid comprises three major capsid proteins: VP1, VP3 and VP5 (12) . Previous studies have shown that each CPV capsid contains 120 copies of VP1, 60 copies of VP3 and 120 copies of VP5. VP1 is the shell protein that forms the CPV capsid shell; VP3 is the mRNA-capping enzyme; and VP5 serves as the clamp protein to enhance the stability of the CPV capsid shell (10, 12) . In addition, one cypoviral RdRP, VP2, is located at the inner surface of the CPV capsid shell at each 5-fold axis (3, 7) . Moreover, Cheng and colleagues recently found that during cypoviral mRNA transcription, both VP1 and VP3 undergo conformational changes, resulting in an enlarged capsid chamber and a wider channel in the capsid for mRNA transport and capping (8) . For VP5, no structural change has been detected (8) , and it was not known whether VP5 contains any activity other than stabilizing capsid shell.\n"," For RNA viruses including reoviruses, vRNA molecules require proper secondary and tertiary structures to form diverse cis-acting elements within their 5 0untranslated region, 3 0 -untranslated region or protein coding region, which are important for vRNA functions such as translation, replication and encapsidation (13) (14) (15) . Moreover, the interactions (also termed 'cyclization') between the 5 0 -and 3 0 -termini of vRNAs have been recognized as an important prelude for efficient vRNA replication of many (+)RNA viruses like flaviviruses, (À)RNA viruses like hantaviruses and dsRNA viruses like reoviruses (16) (17) (18) . For reoviruses, the 5 0 -3 0 cyclization of reoviral (+)RNA forms a panhandle-like structure (19, 20) . This 5 0 -3 0 panhandle is required for efficient dsRNA replication, probably by allowing reoviral RdRP to recognize the 3 0 -terminal of the (+)RNA template to initiate (À)RNA synthesis (18) . On the other hand, like other 5 0 -3 0 cyclized vRNAs (21) , the panhandle should be disrupted when RNA replication proceeds on the cyclized template (18) .\n"," The formation and dissociation of RNA tertiary structures should be highly regulated for RNAs to function properly in various processes. However, correct folding or unfolding of RNAs is always challenging, since it is believed that RNAs would be easily trapped in local intermediate structures that are thermodynamically stable (15, 22) . In response, cells or viruses encode various RNA remodeling proteins, generally including adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent RNA helicases and ATPindependent RNA chaperones, which are proposed to help overcome the thermodynamic barriers of kinetically trapped RNA molecules. RNA helicases are thought to be involved in most ATP-dependent structural rearrangements of RNAs (23) . On the other hand, RNA chaperones are a heterogeneous group of proteins that are able to destabilize or unwind RNA helices and accelerate the formation of correctly folded RNA structures by helping misfolded RNAs escape kinetic traps. For the viruses having vRNA cyclization, both hantavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein and flavivirus core (capsid) protein are RNA chaperones, and hantavirus N has also been reported to unwind the 5 0 -3 0 panhandle structure in vitro (21) . However, no capsid protein of CPVs or other reoviruses has been found to be an RNA chaperone.\n"," The type 5 Helicoverpa armigera cypovirus (HaCPV-5) was initially isolated by our laboratory in 2006 from a mixture of HaCPVs and can quickly cause lethal disease in H. armigera, which is one of the most serious agricultural pests in China (24) . Thus far, the RNA genome of HaCPV-5 has been completely sequenced (24, 25) . HaCPV-5 RNA segment 8 contains a single open reading frame that encodes a 44-kDa protein, and further sequence and structural analysis using bioinformatic tools has revealed that this 44-kDa protein is the VP5 capsid protein (11, 12, 26) . In this study, we expressed HaCPV-5 VP5 in a eukaryotic expression system and determined that this CPV VP5 possesses an RNA chaperone-like activity to ATP-independently destabilize RNA helices and accelerate strand annealing. Our further characterization of VP5 revealed that its helix-destabilizing activity is RNA specific, lacks directionality and could be inhibited by divalent metallic ions, such as Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Ca 2+ or Zn 2+ , to various degrees. Moreover, we found that HaCPV-5 VP5 could facilitate the transcription initiation of an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through a CPV panhandle-structured RNA template, thereby strongly suggesting a direct role of the RNA chaperone activity of VP5 in the initiation of cypoviral dsRNA replication.\n"," Standard procedures were used for extraction of viral genome RNA and reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (25) . A cDNA fragment of HaCPV-5 RNA segment 8 open reading frame (VP5) (Accession No. DQ178180) was inserted into the vector pFastBac TM HTB-MBP that was originated from pFastBac TM HTB (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in which the maltose binding protein (MBP) was N-terminally fused by us as previously described (27, 28) .

The complexes were then analyzed via 10% SDS-PAGE and western blots. To detect which form of MBP-VP5 binds RNA, MBP-VP5 were first cross-linked with the HEX-labeled RNA1 probe using a 254-nm ultraviolet (UV) light for 10 min, and the light source was 5 cm away from the samples. After that, the samples were subjected to chemical cross-linking as described above. The complexes were then analyzed via 10% SDS-PAGE and scanned by a Typhoon 9200 imager (GE Healthcare).\n"," The standard helix destabilizing assay was performed as previously described (28, 32) with minor modifications. In brief, 10 pmol of protein and 0.1 pmol of helix substrate were added to a mixture containing a final concentration of 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) and 5 U RNasin (Promega) and incubated at 37 C for 60 min unless otherwise indicated. The reactions were terminated by adding 5 U proteinase K and 2.5 ml 5Â loading buffer [100 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 50% glycerol and bromophenol blue].

For the hybridization of the HEX-labeled 46-nt and unlabeled 146-nt RNA strands, their sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2 . Then mixtures were also resolved on 12% native-PAGE gels ( Figure 9 ) or 8% native-PAGE gels ( Figure 10 ), following by scanning with a Typhoon 9200 imager (GE Healthcare).\n"," The RT assay was previously described by Mir et al. (21) with some modifications. Briefly, the structured RNA mimicking cypovirus panhandle was generated using 36 nt from the 5 0 -end and 30 nt from the 3 0 -end of HaCPV-5 RNA segment 8. The sequences of the panhandle and DNA primer were indicated in Figure 12A . The mixture of 0.1 pmol panhandle, 5 pmol DNA primer and 0.5 mM deoxynucleoside triphosohates (dNTPs) with digoxigenin (DIG)-dUTP was incubated with indicated amount of MBP-VP5 or MBP alone without heating and cooling, while for the positive control, the mixture was heated at 68 C for 3 min and placed on ice to allow the annealing of the primer to the panhandle. After incubation, 4 ml of the RT buffer, 1 ml of 0.1 M DTT, 5 U RNasin and 0.5 ml M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) were supplemented and reacted at 25 C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by heating at 80 C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed on 6% urea page and northern blot. The northern blot was performed as previously described (29) .\n"," Among HaCPV-5 RNA segments, segment 8 encodes a 44-kDa protein that is homologous with VP5 proteins of other CPVs based on amino acid sequences ( Figure 1A ) but shares no sequence homology with any other non-VP5 CPV proteins (data not shown). To further compare this protein with other CPV VP5 proteins, we modeled its 3D structure by submitting its amino acid sequence to the HMMSTR/Rosetta server (26) and found that its modeled structure is highly similar to that of BmCPV-1 VP5 ( Figure 1D ), which has been solved and extensively studied (33) . Altogether, these results show that this protein is the VP5 capsid protein of HaCPV-5.\n"," To determine the potential function of HaCPV-5 VP5, we expressed this protein as an N-terminal maltose binding fusion protein (MBP-VP5) in a eukaryotic (baculovirus) expression system and then purified the protein ( Figure 1B and C). Because many capsid proteins of RNA viruses have RNA binding activity (21, 34, 35) , we sought to determine whether VP5 could also bind to RNA. To this end, a gel mobility shift assay with a HEX-labeled 24-nt ssRNA (RNA1) was conducted. MBP-VP5 did bind to RNA1 (Figure 2A, lane 3) , showing that VP5 has ssRNA binding activity. Moreover, to determine whether VP5 also has dsRNA binding activity, we constructed the RNA helix by annealing HEX-labeled RNA1 with a nonlabeled RNA (RNA2) that is complementary to RNA1 and found that VP5 efficiently shifted the RNA helix ( Figure 2A , lane 6). After determining that MBP-VP5 can bind to both ssRNA and dsRNA, it is intriguing for us to examine whether this protein has a higher affinity for ssRNA or for dsRNA. To this end, RNA probe competition assays were performed. Briefly, 0.1 pmol HEX-labeled ssRNA probe and 2 pmol MBP-VP5 were incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled ssRNA (RNA10) or dsRNA (RNA10/RNA2). As shown in Figure 2B , only the ssRNA competitor efficiently competed with HEXlabeled RNA1, while dsRNA had a minimal competing effect, indicating that MBP-VP5 has a higher affinity for ssRNA.\n"," Moreover, we incubated 0.01 mM of HEX-labeled RNA1 with increasing concentrations of MBP-VP5 (0.05-0.48 mM), and our result showed that MBP-VP5 binds to ssRNA in a dose-response manner ( Figure 2C ). The RNA binding data were then quantified, and a Hill transformation was applied to determine whether the binding of MBP-VP5 to ssRNA is cooperative [a >1 Hill coefficient indicates positive cooperativity (36, 37) ]. As shown in Figure 2D , MBP-VP5 at low concentrations (0.05-0.16 mM) had a Hill coefficient value of $1.499, whereas high protein concentrations (0.2-0.48 mM) had a higher Hill coefficient value of $4.972. These results indicate that VP5 binds to ssRNA in a cooperative manner. Taken together, these results show that HaCPV-5 VP5 has both ssRNA and dsRNA binding capacity, has higher affinity for ssRNA and binds ssRNA in a cooperative manner. Besides, we also examined if MBP-VP5 can bind to DNA, and our results showed that this protein also has ssDNA and dsDNA binding activities (Supplementary Figure S1) .\n"," After determining the RNA binding activity of VP5, we ought to examine the form of MBP-VP5 in solution. To this end, the in vitro chemical cross-linking assay was performed, followed by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. Our result showed that MBP-VP5 has both monomeric and dimeric forms in solution ( Figure 3A) . Moreover, this result was further confirmed by the gel filtration assay (Supplementary Figure S2) . Then, it is intriguing to determine which form of MBP-VP5 binds to RNA. To this end, MBP-VP5 was incubated with HEX-labeled RNA1 probe and then subjected to UV The 3D structure of HaCPV-5 VP5 was modeled by the HMMSTR/ Rosetta server, and drawn by PyMOL as described in 'Materials and Methods' section. The three mutation sites as well as N-and C-termini were labeled as indicated. (E and F) The surface representations of modeled VP5, which indicate the orientation of VP5 on the CPV particle (E), or in the asymmetric unit formed by VP1, VP3 and VP5 (F).

The maps of CPV particle and the asymmetric unit are drawn by PyMOL based on the atomic cryoEM structure of BmCPV capsid (PDB number 3IZX) by replacing BmCPV VP5 with HaCPV-5 VP5.\n"," cross-linking. The purpose of this step is to label the VP5 proteins that are binding to RNA. After that, the samples were subjected to chemical cross-linking with 0.01% [vol/ vol] glutaraldehyde, and analyzed via SDS-PAGE and scanned by a Typhoon 9200 to visualize the presence of HEX-labeled RNA. Our results showed that both monomeric and dimeric forms of MBP-VP5 can bind to ssRNA in vitro ( Figure 3B ), indicating that the RNA binding activity of VP5 is independent of its monomeric or dimeric form.\n"," The finding that HaCPV-5 VP5 contains both ssRNA and dsRNA binding activities led us to question whether this protein also has nucleic acid helix-destabilizing activity like flavivirus core (capsid) and hantavirus N do (21, 35) . For this purpose, the HEX-labeled RNA1 and a long nonlabeled 54-nt RNA (RNA3) were annealed to generate a standard RNA helix substrate with both 5 0 (15 bases) and 3 0 (15 bases) single-stranded tails ( Figure 4A ). The helix-destabilizing assay was performed by incubating the standard RNA helix substrate with purified MBP-VP5 in the standard destabilizing reaction mixture and then evaluating the substrate via gel electrophoresis. The HEX-labeled RNA strand was released from the RNA helix substrate in the presence of MBP-VP5 ( Figure 4A, lane 4) , whereas the RNA helix was stable when MBP alone was added to the reaction mixture (lane 3). The boiled helix substrates were used as the positive controls for helix destabilization in this (lane 1) and the subsequent assays. These results indicate that VP5 has RNA helix-destabilizing activity.\n"," Because some viral proteins with RNA helixdestabilizing activities can also unwind DNA helices or RNA-DNA hybrids, we sought to determine whether VP5 can destabilize nucleic acid helices containing DNA. To this end, we constructed three different helix Figure 4C ) by annealing HEXlabeled DNA1 and the long nonlabeled RNA3; and R*/ D ( Figure 4D ) by annealing HEX-labeled RNA1 and nonlabeled DNA2. Each substrate was incubated with MBP-VP5 under the conditions described in Figure 4A . MBP-VP5 was unable to destabilize any of these DNAcontaining helices ( Figure 4B-D) , showing that the helixdestabilizing activity of VP5 is RNA specific. Interestingly, we previously found that VP5 can bind both RNA and DNA (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S1 ), suggesting that the protein binding to nucleic acids is the prerequisite but not the only determinant for helix destabilization.\n"," To further confirm the helix-destabilizing activity of VP5, we generated point mutations (T23A, F25A and Q273A) at the highly conserved residues within the consensus regions of CPV VP5 ( Figure 5A ). These mutants were expressed in a eukaryotic expression system as MBP-fusion proteins, purified ( Figure 5B ) and then assessed for their helixdestabilizing activities. Our results showed that the F25A or Q273A mutation dramatically reduced the destabilization of the standard RNA helix substrate ( Figure 5C, lanes  4 and 6) , whereas the T23A mutation almost abolished the unwinding activity of VP5 ( Figure 5C, lane 5) . Moreover, we examined the RNA binding activities of these mutants, and found that these mutations resulted in the loss or dramatic decrease of RNA binding ( Figure 5D ). Based on the modeled surface representation of these mutant residues on VP5 ( Figure 1D -F), T23 is located on the surface of VP5, while F25 and Q273 residues are located within the protein, suggesting that the strategies of these mutations to inhibit RNA binding and helix destabilizing activities of VP5 are different.\n"," To characterize the helix-destabilizing activity of VP5, we designed three different RNA helix substrates: one containing a 3 0 single-stranded tail (15 bases), one containing 5 0 single-stranded tail (15 bases) and one with blunt ends ( Figure 6A -C, left panels). Each substrate was incubated with MBP-VP5 in the standard destabilizing reaction mixture. Our results showed that both the 3 0 -tailed and 5 0 -tailed RNA helices could be efficiently unwound by MBP-VP5 ( Figure 6A and B) , whereas the blunt-ended RNA helix could not be unwound ( Figure 6C ). These experiments were independently repeated several times by us. Overall, these results show that HaCPV-5 VP5 destabilizes RNA helices in both 3 0 -to-5 0 and 5 0 -to-3 0 directions.\n"," Next, we sought to determine the impact of the length of the single-stranded tail on its helix-destabilizing activity. To this end, a series of RNA helix substrates with different lengths (3-23 nt) of 3 0 single-stranded tails were generated ( Figure 7A ), and unwinding assays were performed by incubating 10 pmol MBP-VP5 with 0.1 pmol indicated helix substrates for 60 min ( Figure 7B ) or for 5 different time points (0, 5, 10, 20 and 25 min) ( Figure 7C ). Our results showed that all these single-stranded 3 0 -tails could similarly support the helix destabilization by VP5 and the length of 3 0 -tail had no much effect on the helix destabilization. This phenomenon is consistent with our previous observation of Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus (EoV) nonstructural protein 2C, which also displays RNA chaperone activity (32) .\n"," Previously, we established the RNA helix-destabilizing activity of HaCPV-5 VP5 in the absence of ATP. Thus, we sought to determine whether the presence of ATP has any effect on the unwinding activity of VP5. For this purpose, the standard RNA helix substrate with both 3 0 and 5 0 tails ( Figure 8A ) was incubated with MBP-VP5 in the presence of increasing concentrations (0.25-10 mM) of ATP for 10 min ( Figure 8B ) or 60 min ( Figure 8C ). In either condition, the presence of ATP had no positive effect on the unwinding activity of VP5 ( Figure 8B and C); in contrast, higher ATP concentrations (>0.25 mM) actually inhibited RNA helix destabilization in a dose-response manner ( Figure 8B , lanes 3-8; 8C, lanes 4-9). These experiments were independently repeated several times, and the gradual inhibitory effect of increasing concentrations of ATP was plotted ( Figure 8B and C, right panels).\n"," After determining that ATP has an inhibitory effect on helix destabilization by VP5, we sought to determine whether other nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) or dNTPs have similar or different effects. To this end, the destabilizing activity of VP5 was assessed in the presence of ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP, dATP, dGTP, dCTP or dTTP at a final concentration of 0.5 mM. As shown in Figure 8D , ATP, dATP, GTP or dGTP had an obvious inhibitory effect on the destabilizing activity of VP5, but other NTPs or dNTPs had negligible inhibitory effect. Altogether, these data further confirm the ATP independence of VP5 helixdestabilizing activity, thereby excluding the possibility that VP5 may contain ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity.\n"," To characterize the activity of VP5 in destabilizing RNA secondary structures, we adapted a canonical assay, which was initially developed by DeStefano and colleagues for measuring the helix-destabilizing and annealing acceleration activities of vRNA chaperones (38) (39) (40) , for this cypoviral VP5. For this purpose, two 42-nt complementary RNA strands that form defined stem-loop structures were used ( Figure 9A ), and one strand was 5 0 HEX labeled ( Figure 9A, right) . HEX-labeled (0.1 pmol) and nonlabeled (0.1 pmol) strands were mixed and incubated with MBP alone or MBP-VP5 in the standard destabilizing mixture, and then the hybridization of the two complementary strands was measured via gel electrophoresis ( Figure 9B-D) . In the presence of MBP alone, little spontaneous hybridization was detected according to increased reaction time ( Figure 9B, lanes 3-8) , whereas the presence of 10 pmol VP5 promoted the hybridization of the two RNA strands ( Figure 9C, lanes 3-8) . Moreover, when we increased the amounts of MBP-VP5 to 40 pmol, a more dramatic stimulation of the RNA strand annealing was observed ( Figure 9D, lanes  3-8) . These data show that VP5 contains the helixdestabilizing activity that can unwind RNA secondary structures and stimulate the formation of more stable RNA hybrids.\n"," To further determine the strand-annealing stimulation activity of VP5, we generated a shorter HEX-labeled RNA strand (46 nt in length) and a longer nonlabeled complementary RNA strand (146 nt in length; Figure 10A ). Equal amounts (0.1 pmol) of these two strands were incubated for 15 min in the presence of MBP alone or MBP-VP5. Gel electrophoresis was conducted to detect the annealing of the two complementary RNA strands. The annealing of the RNA strands in the presence of MBP alone was almost undetectable ( Figure 10B, lane 3) , whereas the presence of 5 pmol MBP-VP5 dramatically stimulated strand annealing ( Figure 10B, lane 4) . Moreover, nucleic acid chaperone normally functions well when its amount is in large excess over that of its substrate (21) . To determine whether this notion also applies to VP5, we incubated increasing amounts (5-40 pmol) of MBP-VP5 with the two RNA strands (0.1 pmol each). As shown in Figure 10B (lanes 4-8) , increasing the amount of MBP-VP5 led to stronger stimulating effects on strand annealing in a dose-response manner. Taken together, our data show that HaCPV-5 VP5 contains RNA chaperone-like activity that can destabilize RNA helices and stimulate RNA strand annealing. concentrations. Our results showed that the destabilizing activity was optimal at 0 mM for Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ ( Figure 11B and C) , and the increase of Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ concentrations from 0 to 20 mM led to a gradual decrease in the helix-destabilizing activity of MBP-VP5. Interestingly, this observation also excludes the possibility that the inhibitory effect of higher ATP concentrations (>0.25 mM) on VP5-mediated helix destabilization (Figure 8 ) was due to the chelation of Mg 2+ , which could be caused by adding large quantities of ATP or other NTPs (32, 41) , since lower Mg 2+ concentrations actually enhance helix destabilization. For Ca 2+ , the helix-destabilizing activity of MBP-VP5 was optimal at 1.25 mM, and the increase of Ca 2+ concentrations from 1.25 to 20 mM also led to a gradual decrease in the RNA helix destabilization ( Figure 11D ). Our results showed that the inhibitory effect of Zn 2+ on helix destabilization was more dramatic than that of the other three divalent ions, and the helix-destabilizing activity of VP5 was almost abolished when the concentration of Zn 2+ reached 5 mM ( Figure 11E) . Moreover, all these divalent metallic ions conferred inhibitory effects in a doseresponse manner.\n"," Furthermore, we sought to determine the optimal pH value for the helix-destabilizing activity of VP5. VP5 prefers a neutral or mildly basic pH, as the reaction conditions were optimal at pH 7.0-7.5 ( Figure 11F) .\n"," Last, we assessed the effects of the molar ratio of VP5 versus RNA duplex substrate as well as the incubation time on the destabilizing activity of VP5. At a molar ratio of 100:1, the helix-unwinding efficiency of VP5 reached $80%, and VP5 completely unwound the RNA duplex substrates at a ratio of 200:1 (for 30 min incubation; Figure 11G) . A subsequent experiment showed that the helix-destabilizing activity of VP5 (at the molar ratio of 100:1) was dependent on the incubation time ( Figure 11H ).\n"," After determining the RNA chaperone activity of VP5, we sought to determine its potential role in CPV RNA replication. Since the destabilization of the 5 0 -3 0 panhandle structure of CPV (+)RNA should occur before or when the (À)RNA synthesis proceeds on the cyclized (+)RNA template (18) , it is plausible that VP5 functions to unwind the reoviral 5 0 -3 0 panhandle to allow replication initiation at the accessible 3 0 -end by an RdRP. To assess this possibility, we adapted a canonical assay, which was developed by Panganiban and colleagues for assessing the ability of hantavirus N protein to facilitate RNA replication initiation through the hantaviral panhandle structure (21), for VP5. We used this assay to determine whether VP5 can enhance in vitro primer-dependent replication initiation by an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) through the cypoviral panhandle structure. To this end, a structured RNA mimicking the cypoviral panhandle structure was constructed using 36 nt from the 5 0 -end and 30 nt from the 3 0 -end of HaCPV-5 RNA segment 8, and then used as the template for RT ( Figure 12A , upper panel). Moreover, because RT reactions normally involve thermal cycles at 68 C to denature and anneal the RNA template with a primer, the RT reactions were carried out at 25 C in the presence or absence of MBP-VP5 to assess the potential role of the VP5's RNA chaperone activity to unwind panhandle structure of the RNA template. Here, DIG-labeled dUTP was supplemented into the reaction mixture for visualizing the RT products. As shown in Figure 12B , the presence of VP5 dramatically stimulated the synthesis of RT products (lane 2), as did the thermal annealing treatment at 68 C (lane 1); on the other hand, the reaction product was barely detectable in the absence of VP5 ( Figure 12B, lanes 3 and 4) .\n"," To further confirm the capacity of VP5 to facilitate RT through the panhandle structure, we conducted the reactions at varying molar ratios of VP5 to the panhandlestructured template. Our data showed that the stimulating effect of VP5 on the RTs was optimal at molar ratios of 10:1-50:1 ( Figure 12C, lanes 3 and 4) .\n"," Taken together, these results strongly suggest that VP5 has a direct role in CPV dsRNA synthesis by destabilizing the 5 0 -3 0 panhandle structure to promote the accessibility of the 3 0 -end of the (+)RNA template for replication initiation.\n"," As one of the three major CPV capsid proteins, VP5 is also named as clamp protein or large protrusion protein.\n"," Previous studies have demonstrated that 120 copies of VP5 are located on the surface of the CPV capsid, exist in two conformations and function as molecular clamps to interact with and tie together neighboring VP1 shell proteins, thus enhancing the stability of the CPV capsid (8, 33) . Moreover, the structural homologs of CPV VP5 are commonly present in the inner capsids of other turreted reoviruses, including orthoreovirus s2 and aquareovirus VP6, which also function as molecular clamps to stabilize inner capsids (12, 33, 42) . However, whether VP5, a major component of CPV dsRNA replication machinery, and other reoviral clamp proteins contain activities other than structural stabilization was not known. In this report, we show that the VP5 protein from HaCPV-5 is a novel RNA chaperone that destabilizes RNA helices and stimulates strand annealing in an ATP-independent manner, implying a direct role of VP5 in the replication of CPV dsRNA.\n"," It is believed that the vRNA molecules of many RNA viruses could be kinetically trapped in incorrect/inactive intermediate structures, thereby probably requiring RNA chaperones to facilitate proper RNA folding and efficient vRNA replication/translation (14, 43, 44) . So far, HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC), Vif and Tat, flavivirus core, hantavirus N, poliovirus 3AB, coronavirus nucleocapsid (N), tombusvirus p33, hepatitis D virus small delta antigen and EoV 2C have been determined to contain RNA chaperone activities (14, 32) . The list of virus-encoded RNA chaperones is still growing, and our current study adds HaCPV-5 VP5 as a new member of it.\n"," In the family Reoviridae, CPV VP5 may not be the only RNA chaperone, as rotavirus nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2), which is a multifunctional enzyme involved in rotaviral dsRNA replication, was previously shown to contain ATP-independent nucleic acid helix-destabilizing activity (45) . As observed with CPV VP5, the helixdestabilizing activity of rotavirus NSP2 has no nucleotide sequence specificity and lacks unwinding directionality. It is generally believed that the helix-destabilizing activity of RNA chaperones normally requires a large excess of protein over RNA helix substrates (32, 39) , and this notion also applies to both CPV VP5 and rotavirus NSP2. The optimal unwinding activity of VP5 was observed at the protein-to-nucleic acid molar ratio of $100:1-200:1, whereas the optimal activity of rotavirus NSP2 was detected at much higher molar ratios of $1000:1-2000:1 (45) .\n"," On the other hand, some features of rotavirus NSP2 and CPV VP5 are different. For instance, VP5 binds to both RNA and DNA and exhibits RNA-specific destabilizing activity (Figure 4) , whereas NSP2 is an ssRNA binding protein and can unwind both RNA-RNA and DNA-RNA helix substrates (45, 46) . The difference between VP5 and NSP2 implies that these two proteins may not use the same mechanism to destabilize RNA helices. Moreover, because no previous study has determined whether rotavirus NSP2 possesses strand annealing acceleration activity, an important characteristic of RNA chaperones, further characterization of NSP2 is needed to determine whether this protein can be recognized as an RNA or nucleic acid chaperone. Both CPV VP5 and rotavirus NSP2 are components of reoviral RNA replication machinery: the former is a major CPV capsid protein, and the latter is associated with the rotaviral RdRP (12, 47) . There is no homology between rotavirus NSP2 and any CPV structural or nonstructural proteins; on the other hand, CPV VP5 has no sequence similarity with any rotavirus proteins. Moreover, as a 'nonturreted' reovirus, rotavirus does not encode clamp proteins (48) . These observations led us to question whether CPV or rotavirus contains extra RNA chaperone or helix-destabilizing protein, except VP5 or NSP2, respectively. However, since it is not uncommon for a virus (e.g. HIV-1) to encode multiple RNA chaperones, the possibility that a reovirus contains more than one RNA chaperones cannot be ruled out, and it would be interesting for us or others to investigate this issue in the future.\n"," During the RNA replication of reoviruses, (+)-vRNAs (mRNAs) are encapsidated into the nascently assembled inner capsids and are then used by reoviral RdRPs as replication templates to synthesize genomic dsRNA segments within the inner capsids (1, 2, 4) . As seen with (À)-vRNA of hantavirus, reoviral (+)-vRNA can be cyclized, and its 5 0 -and 3 0 -ends undergo base pairing to form a panhandle-like structure (49) . Previous studies revealed that the panhandle structure of cyclized reoviral (+)-vRNA is required for efficient dsRNA synthesis probably by recruiting RdRPs to the 3 0 -end of the (+)-vRNA template (18) . Moreover, like other 5 0 -3 0 cyclized vRNAs, before or when RNA replication initiates, the vRNA panhandle structure should be dissociated to make the 3 0 -end of the template accessible by RdRPs (18) . Considering that hantavirus N, a nucleocapsid protein and RNA chaperone, can efficiently unwind the 5 0 -3 0 panhandle of cyclized hantaviral (À)-vRNA and subsequently promote transcription/replication initiation (21, 50) , we propose that the RNA chaperone activity of CPV VP5 is directly involved in the initiation of CPV dsRNA replication by destabilizing cypoviral panhandle structure in a similar manner. In accordance with this speculation, we found that when an RNA structure mimicking the cypoviral panhandle was used as a template, HaCPV-5 VP5 effectively promoted primerdependent transcription initiation by an alternative polymerase (i.e. reverse transcriptase) ( Figure 12) .\n"," As a heterogeneous group of proteins that share no consensus sequences or motifs, RNA or nucleic acid chaperones are poorly understood in regard to the mechanism(s) governing their ATP-independent helix-destabilizing and annealing stimulation activities. To explain the RNA chaperone activities, an 'entropy transfer' model has been proposed. According to this model, RNA chaperones contain intrinsically disordered (unstructured), highly flexible regions that can transfer their disorder or entropy to misfolded RNA molecules on binding to RNA. Such an entropy transfer can destabilize kinetically trapped misfolded RNA molecules, leading to the rearrangement of RNA folding in an ATP-independent manner (13, 14) . So far, many virus-encoded RNA chaperones, including HIV-1 NC, Vif and Tat, hantavirus N, flavivirus core, coronavirus N and tombusvirus p33, have been predicted to contain intrinsically disordered regions (14, 51) . However, since the regions responsible for chaperoning activities have not been accurately mapped in many RNA chaperones, the relationship between intrinsic disorder and RNA chaperone activities is difficult to formally determine (43, 52) . Furthermore, alternative models, such as transient ionic or electrostatic interactions, have also been proposed to explain the RNA chaperone activity (22) . Our disorder prediction of CPV VP5 using PONDR VL-XT (51, 53, 54) indicates that VP5 proteins from three different types of cypoviruses-CPV-5, CPV-1 and CPV-18-contain similar distribution patterns of potentially disordered regions (data not shown), thereby suggesting that the 'entropy transfer' applies to HaCPV-5 VP5, and VP5 proteins of other CPVs may also contain RNA chaperone activity.\n"," As a single-shelled member of the family Reoviridae, CPV is well recognized as an ideal and simplified model for studying the mechanisms of vRNA replication and mRNA capping of the Reoviridae and probably other dsRNA Viridae. In this study, we found that a CPV capsid clamp protein VP5 possesses a novel RNA chaperone activity, which is thought to be directly involved in the initiation of CPV dsRNA replication. These findings show that CPV capsid proteins not only include RNA polymerase and mRNA capping enzyme, but also RNA chaperone that is important for vRNA replication and/or translation. This study should extend our understanding of RNA replication of CPV, Reoviridae and dsRNA Viridae, and also enrich our knowledge about virus-encoded RNA chaperones. Furthermore, since the (+)-vRNA cyclization and panhandle structures commonly exist in the family Reoviridae, encoding an RNA chaperone or other RNA remodeling protein, like helicase, might be a common strategy for all reoviruses. Future studies by our group and others should reveal whether rotavirus NSP2, the clamp proteins of other turreted reoviruses, as well as other reoviral structural or nonstructural proteins can also function in 5 0 -3 0 panhandle unwinding and RNA replication initiation.\n","Score: 3.438624435336738\n","\n","Title: Generation of MERS-CoV Pseudotyped Viral Particles for the Evaluation of Neutralizing Antibodies in Mammalian Sera\n","Body Text: Pseudotype viruses (also known as pseudoviruses, pseudoparticles, or pseudotype viral particles) were discovered in 1911 [1] . They are chimeric viral particles expressing recombinant glycoproteins from one virus on the surface of another replication-deficient virus (viral vector), generating a single round chimeric viral particles. Pseudotype viral particles have been developed for many viruses especially those requiring high containment facilities such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola, and highly pathogenic influenza A viruses without the need to handle wild-type viruses [2] . Pseudotype-based assays allow for accurate, specific, and sensitive detection of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and screening for viral entry inhibitors.\n"," The most efficient and common viral vectors for the production of pseudotype viral particles are lentiviruses. Lentiviral vectors are retroviruses, which are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses, derived, for example, from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). They have been used to develop pseudotype viral particles for many pathogenic viruses [3] [4] [5] [6] . These replication-deficient vectors offer a number of advantages including that they do not replicate in mammalian cells, they infect dividing and nondividing cells, they can incorporate large transgenes derived from other pathogenic viruses as large as 9 kb, and they induce no or weak immune response [7] [8] [9] . Several studies have utilized lentiviral vectors to generate MERS-CoV pseudotype viral particles (MERSpp) to evaluate nAbs in humans and animals. Here, we describe detailed protocol for the generation and utilization of MERSpp. This protocol is based on lentiviral system and use of luciferase enzyme as the main readout reporter of the system. \n"," Proper antiseptic techniques should be used, and all equipment and solutions to be used with cells must be sterile.

Alternatively, aspirate off medium and add 30 μL of 1Â passive lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-phosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mM DTT, 2 mM 1,2-diaminocyclohexaneN,N,N 0 ,N 0 -tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) to each well. Then, freeze and thaw the cells once on dry ice. After thawing, leave the plate at room temperature for 30 min before reading luciferase activity on Luminometer supplied with two injectors for both luciferase buffer (15 mM MgSO4, 15 mM KPO4 (pH 7.8), 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT in d H 2 O; 20 mL is needed per plate to add 100 μL per well) and luciferase substrates (D-luciferin potassium salt dissolve in H 2 O at 0.3 mg/mL, 10 mL is needed per plate to add 50 μL per well). Measure light produced from the reaction~8 s after adding the substrate using an integration time of 5-30 s.\n"," 15. Alternatively, the HIV-1 p24 content in the generated pseudotyped viruses could be quantified by HIV-1 p24 CA capture ELISA kit and pseudotyped viruses equivalent to~500 ηg of p24 could be used in neutralization assay.\n"," 16. Use heat-inactivated serum samples at 56 C for 30 min.\n","Score: 3.4274531717995664\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<Figure size 640x480 with 1

Charadriformes, are thought to be the principal natural reservoir of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses [1, 2] , as well as the source of influenza A viruses infecting all other animals [3] . Indeed, LPAI includes nearly all influenza subtypes, and wild bird migration can bring viruses to new areas and species [1, 4] . The LPAI A(H7N9) virus was first identified in humans in China in early 2013 [5] . As at 15 October 2015, 678 confirmed human infections have been documented, with a case fatality rate of ca 40% [6] . The virus most probably originated in wild bird populations [7, 8] , was introduced into domestic ducks and chickens and has since become well established in poultry populations in south-eastern China [6] . Transmission to humans occurs primarily at live bird markets (LBMs), where direct contact between humans and infected poultry leads to spillover transmission [9] .\n"," Human influenza A(H7N9) infections have been well documented by the Chinese government and public health authorities. Outbreaks of human influenza A(H7N9) cases peak in winter months [10] and geographical diffusion from the eastern to the southern region of China has been observed [11] . As is true for most LPAI viruses, influenza A(H7N9) does not produce significant illness in domestic poultry, implying that poultry can be infected asymptomatically [6] . Consequently, poultry infections are likely to be under-reported even though LBMs are being closely and actively monitored [12, 13] . This limited, partial observation of influenza A(H7N9) infection in poultry poses a challenge to the study and quantification of the transmission potential of H7N9 viruses in poultry populations, as well as spillover transmission from poultry to humans. However, owing to the transmission link between influenza A(H7N9) infection in poultry and human infection through LBMs [9] , and because human influenza A(H7N9) cases have been well documented, these human cases serve as a sentinel proxy for infection rates among domestic poultry.\n"," Mathematical approaches can be used to infer critical epidemiological processes and parameters. Traditional methods of epidemic curve fitting regard the increase in cumulative cases as an exponential with set doubling times [14] . This approach uses surveillance data during the early exponential growth period of an outbreak to provide retrospective estimates of R0 [15, 16] . However, these estimates rely on specific assumptions, such as the initial susceptibility of the population and the infectious period. In contrast, a Bayesian approach [17] can provide continuous estimation of all system parameters without specific assumptions and is therefore more suitable for nonlinear epidemic modelling. In previous work, we used Bayesian inference methods to infer disease transmission dynamics, estimate critical epidemiological parameters, and generate forecasts of seasonal and pandemic human influenza (i.e. H1N1, H3N2, B) in both temperate [18] [19] [20] and subtropical regions [21] .\n"," Here we used human case data and a combined framework of mathematical model and Bayesian inference to simulate influenza A(H7N9) virus transmission among poultry and generate retrospective forecasts of influenza A(H7N9) incidence for both poultry and humans in the eastern and southern regions of China ( Figure 1 ).\n"," Specifically, human influenza A(H7N9) case data in the period from 2013 to 2015 were used in conjunction with a model-inference framework that combines a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model of influenza A(H7N9) virus transmission among poultry and the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) to simulate influenza A(H7N9) virus transmission among poultry, estimate critical epidemiological parameters,\n"," Spatial distribution of human influenza A(H7N9) cases and classification of study regions, China, 19 February 2013-19 September 2015 (n = 526) \n"," The human influenza A(H7N9) cases (black dots indicate case locations) in the study area are grouped into the eastern region (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui provinces: pink) and the southern region (Guangdong, Fujian and Hunan provinces: blue). These cases are shown in the whole map of China and the enlarged map of the study area. Also shown is the South Sea but with no human cases. and generate forecasts of influenza A(H7N9) infections for both humans and poultry. From 19 February 2013 until 19 September 2015, a total of 526 human influenza A(H7N9) cases were extracted from official reports of the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) in China. Associated record attributes included location, observation and reporting date, and descriptive information including age, sex and contact history.\n"," These records were processed into biweekly counts during the 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons and aggregated into two spatial regions, the southern region (Guangdong, Fujian and Hunan provinces) and the eastern region (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui provinces). This spatial grouping was based on the geographical location, common sources for poultry and virus spatial transmission patterns among the provinces. Specifically, provinces in the same region are geographically conjoined, and influenza A(H7N9) virus appeared to diffuse from the eastern region, where chicken farming and consumption occur locally, to the southern region where chickens are imported from northern China (e.g. Hebei and Shandong provinces).\n"," The epidemical model used for this study simulates the transmission of influenza A(H7N9) among poultry as well as spillover transmission from poultry to humans. The model is described by the following equations:\n"," where S is the number of susceptible poultry, Ic and Ih are the number of infectious poultry and humans, respectively, N is chicken population size, β is the contact rate among poultry, D is the mean infectious period, and γ is the scaling factor linking the number of infected poultry with human infections. The basic reproductive rate, R0, is calculated from the infection rate and mean infectious period as R0 = β D, while the effective reproductive rate is also determined from susceptibility as Re = R0 S / N. This modelling framework was implemented with the assumption of homogenous mixing among chicken and human populations, indicating that spillover transmission from poultry to human was constant through time and that no transmission among humans occurred. In essence, we used human influenza A(H7N9) case data as a proxy for infection among poultry. We took this approach because infections among poultry are likely to be greatly under-reported and human influenza A(H7N9) incidence data are much more reliable.\n"," The EAKF is a sequential Monte Carlo, or data assimilation, method that is used to iteratively update the model state variables and parameters with each new observation [22] . This update follows Bayes' rule:\n"," where Zt is the system state, including model variables and parameters S, Ic, Ih, D, R0, and yt is the observation at time t. Formula 4 shows that the updated (i.e. posterior) probability distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood of the occurrence of new observations given the current system state and the prior probability distribution of the system state. The EAKF uses an assumption of normality for the likelihood and prior distribution. In doing so, only the first two statistical moments are needed to characterise the distributions on the right hand side of Formula 4.\n"," The EAKF was selected for iterative Bayesian inference in this work because it was already being used for state space estimation in the geosciences (e.g. climate and weather simulation and prediction) and also in conjunction with influenza state space models to generate seasonal influenza forecasts [18, 19, 21] .\n"," All simulations of influenza A(H7N9) transmission and incidence among poultry and spillover transmission to humans with the model-inference system (i.e. the SIR dynamic model and EAKF inference) were run using a 300-member ensemble of simulations. These simulations were run simultaneously and linked through the EAKF. Before integration with the model equations, each simulation (i.e. ensemble member) was randomly assigned an initial combination of state variables and parameters from specified uniform distributions (see below). These comprised the initial conditions, or 'initial prior', for each simulation before integration. Each initialised ensemble member was then integrated through time using the equations of the model; as each simulation has a different initial array of state variables and parameters, the trajectory of each simulation differs. The ensemble was integrated until the time point of the first observation at which the run was halted and the EAKF algorithm and observation were used to update the ensemble mean and variance of the observed state variable (here incidence) according to Formula 4, as well as all the unobserved variables and parameters [19, 22] . The conditions upon halting before the EAKF update are termed the 'prior'; the conditions after the EAKF update are termed the 'posterior'. The mean prior and posterior are averages across the ensemble; for example, the mean prior and posterior of susceptibility (S) is simply the ensemble average value of S before and after EAKF updating at a particular point in time.\n"," The use of an ensemble of simulations provided an easy means of estimating credible intervals and uncertainties, both for parameter estimates and forecasts. Indeed, for the EAKF, the prior and posterior moments (i.e. mean and variance) can be calculated directly from the average prior and posterior estimates of all the 300 ensemble members. Time series of 300-member ensemble mean posterior (red) and prior (blue) for key epidemiological variables (susceptibility (S) and the number of infections in chicken (Ic)), and for parameters (the infectious period (D), chicken-to-chicken contact rate (β) and the effective and basic reproductive rate (Re and R0)), during different seasons and regions. In each season, variables and parameters were adjusted from the beginning of the season to the two-week period with the last recorded case. Both the prior and posterior mean estimates are shown; EAKF adjustment at a given time is the difference of the mean posterior minus the mean prior.\n"," The described cycle of integration and adjustment was repeated for each successive observation, i.e. after updating, the posterior was integrated through time until the next observation, at which point it became the prior. Then the EAKF and observation were used to generate a new posterior. Through this iterative updating process, the estimates of the state variables and parameters converge to a combination capable of simulating the outbreak as observed up to that point. The intention was that by optimising the model to simulate conditions as observed from the past to present, a better forecast of the future can be generated using that optimised ensemble of simulation.\n"," The state variable-parameter vector of the SIR-EAKF framework included optimisation of three variables (S, Ic and Ih) and two parameters (D and R0). At the beginning of each outbreak, we initialised each simulation (i.e. each ensemble member) using a random selection from uniform ranges of the parameters and variables (2 < D < 10 days, 0.01 < R0 < 2.0, 0.5 < S0 < 0.6, 0 < Ic0 < 250). These initial uniform ranges were based on prior modelling efforts simulating and forecasting human seasonal influenza [18, 20] . In addition, as the transmission potential of influenza A(H7N9) virus among poultry is not well described, a broad initial prior range for R0 was used; however, note that the EAKF in the presence of observations can adjust the model parameters and variables to values outside these initial ranges. A Latin hypercube sampling approach was used to generate a near-random initial prior sample across this multidimensional distribution of parameter and variable values.\n"," Multiplicative inflation was used to increase the ensemble variance of all model variables and parameters by 2% before EAKF adjustment. Inflation is commonly applied to ensemble Kalman filters in order to avoid 'filter divergence', the situation in which the variance across the ensemble of simulations has contracted so much that the EAKF updating algorithm \n"," Top panels: Accuracy was measured as the percentage of ensembles predicting (A) the week with the most human influenza A(H7N9) cases within one week of the observed peak week and (B) the peak magnitude of human influenza A(H7N9) cases within 25% of the observed peak magnitude. It is presented as a function of the forecast week relative to observed (blue) and predicted (green) peak timing.\n"," Bottom panels: Forecasts initiated (C) 4 weeks, (D) 2 weeks and (E) 0 weeks ahead of the observed peak week for the southern region during the 2013/14 season. The SIR model was recursively optimised up to the week of forecast initiation using observations (black x) and the EAKF; the red x are future observations which were not used in the model optimisation. The black and green lines are the mean trajectory of the ensemble and areas shaded grey and green are the 5th and 95th percentiles of the ensemble posterior for simulation and forecast periods, respectively. effectively ignores the observations and model simulations diverge from the truth [22] . The 300-member ensemble simulations were repeated 10 times each season to account for stochastic effects due to the random selection of initial conditions. The average of the 10 repeated runs, each made up of a 300-member ensemble simulation, was used to derive mean posterior estimates of the model parameters.\n"," Several epidemiological parameters are critical for characterising the transmission potential of infectious diseases. The basic reproductive number R0, defined as the number of secondary infections an infectious host would produce in a completely susceptible population, signals the potential of an infectious agent to start an outbreak as well as the transmissibility of a virus in the absence of intervention. The effective reproductive number Re quantifies the transmission force during the actual outbreak and can be used to monitor the impact of control strategies. An Re > 1 indicates epidemic growth, while an Re < 1 indicates that sustained transmission cannot persist and that an outbreak will subside.\n"," Epidemiological parameters, namely β, D, R0 and Re, were estimated for each of three seasons and two regions from the start of the season to the last twoweek period with a recorded case. In a given season, the posterior mean and interquartile range of Ic, Ih, β, D, R0 and Re were estimated at the time of maximal epidemic forcing or the time point of highest transmission potential, i.e. the two-week period with the highest effective reproductive number. The level of initial susceptibility, however, was defined as and estimated for the two-week period with maximal susceptibility. We have previously presented parameter estimates at these key time points in studies of seasonal influenza [18, 20] . The prior and posterior means during each outbreak for each variable and parameter were also recorded ( Figure 2 ).\n"," Parameter estimate changes during the entirety of an outbreak were used to inspect filter adjustment. Such parameter changes over time may reflect changes in the estimation or actual changes to the parameter values. For the former, the observations contain noise and the estimation of the parameters by the EAKF is neither perfect nor instantaneous; consequently, the parameter estimates move through time. For the latter, actual shifts in parameter value can occur, e.g. representing changing contact rates and control measures, as the pathogen moves through different subpopulations and/or geographical areas.\n"," The parameter estimates were inferred using a scaling γ, representing a rate of spillover transmission from chicken to human, equal to 300. This value was selected following tests with γ ranging from 100 to 1,000 in increments of 100. For each value of γ, mean human case forecast error was used to calculate total outbreak root mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation, as well as attack rate error, peak weak error and peak magnitude error between observations and the predicted estimates. A ranking approach was used to identify the scaling with the lowest error. Specifically, for each metric (RMSE, correlation, attack rate error, peak weak error and peak magnitude error), the scaling levels were ranked. The scaling with the highest overall rank, i.e. γ = 300, was selected and used in all simulations and forecasts presented here.\n"," Retrospective forecasts were run for the seasons 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15 for the eastern region and for the last two seasons for the southern region. The model-inference system was again implemented IQR: interquartile range. The posterior means and IQR of the number of chicken infections (I c ), chicken-to-chicken contact rate (β), the infectious period (D) and the basic reproductive rate (R 0 ) were estimated at maximal epidemic forcing (maximal R e ). The level of initial susceptibility (S) was defined and estimated in the two-week period with maximal susceptibility.\n"," using 300-member ensembles and reinitialised with randomly selected variable and parameter combinations at the beginning of each season. All simulations and forecasts were repeated 10 times for each outbreak and were initialised with a random selection of parameter and variable values, as described above. Forecasts were generated beginning with the two-week period of the first recorded case and repeated every 2 weeks following the generation of a new posterior. Specifically, for the eastern region, separate ensemble forecasts were run from the 4th to 9th, 2nd to 17th and 3rd to 9th two-week period for the 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons, respectively; for the southern region, forecasts were generated from the 3rd to 19th and 5th to 12th two-week period for the last two seasons.\n"," To evaluate the accuracy of our SIR-EAKF system, we determined two measurements: the peak week and peak magnitude, or the percentage of ensemble mean trajectories predicting human influenza A(H7N9) case peak timing within ± 1 week of the observed peak week, and peak magnitude within ± 25% of the observed peak magnitude. These two indices were then plotted as a function of the relative forecast week, i.e. the week of forecast generation minus either the observed or predicted peak week, to show the relationship between predictive skill and lead time.\n"," The combined SIR-EAKF system was coded in R. These codes are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n"," The mean posterior estimates of human influenza A(H7N9) incidence produced by the model-inference system matched the observed influenza A(H7N9) human case counts well (Figure 3 ).\n"," These simulations captured the timing and magnitude of the epidemic. Mean posterior estimates of R0 ranged from 1.327 to 1.941 (Table 1) The susceptibility of the chicken population was high in earlier outbreaks and dropped to around 65% in more recent outbreaks. For the effective transmission number Re, which quantifies the transmission force during the outbreak, the mean posterior estimates were greater than 1 during four of the five outbreaks analysed here, indicating a clear transmission potential among LBM poultry. The Re estimate was highest during the initial outbreak in 2012/13 when the two associated parameters, R0 and susceptibility, were also highest. The scaling factor γ, selected by the rank correlation approach (see Methods) mapped the observed human cases to simulated poultry infections and indicated that the daily poultry-to-human spillover transmission rate was low, around 3.3 × 10-3 per infected LBM chicken.\n"," Estimates of all parameters remained stable during the seasons 2013/14 and 2014/15 in the southern region where outbreaks were of similar severity in both epidemic waves. However, there was an apparent decrease in R0, Re, β and susceptibility from the first to the third outbreak in the eastern region, which was in accordance with the change of outbreak severity in this region.\n"," The accuracy of the forecast for peak timing and magnitude increased as the week of forecast initiation got closer to the observed and predicted peak ( Figure 4 ). Accuracy was measured as the percentage of ensembles predicting the week with the most human cases of influenza A(H7N9) within ± 1 week of the observed peak week and the peak magnitude of human H7N9 influenza cases within ± 25% of observed peak magnitude. The values are the same as those in Figure 4 and presented as a function of the forecast lead time from 10 weeks before to 10 weeks after the observed and predicted peak timing.\n"," Specifically, the percentage of forecasts predicting the peak week within ± 1 week increased sharply from 6 weeks ahead of the observed peak week and reached 90% when a forecast was generated at the observed peak. For peak magnitude, the percentage of forecasts predicting the peak magnitude within ± 25% of the observed magnitude increased from 8 weeks before the observed peak, and almost all forecasts were accurate when predicting at the observed peak. However, as knowledge of the observed peak was unavailable for real-time forecasting, we also present overall accuracy as a function of predicted lead time. Here, the accuracy was 43% and 63% at 2 weeks lead time and 61% and 98% at 0 weeks lead time for peak timing and magnitude, respectively ( Table 2 ). Example forecasts are also presented in Figure 4 .\n"," Our findings indicate that data assimilation methods and a simple epidemic model can be combined to infer the transmission dynamics of H7N9 influenza in both chicken and human populations using only human infection data. Moreover, the model-inference system can produce accurate predictions of the peak timing and magnitude of human infections.\n"," The estimated potential of chicken-to-human spillover transmission was low, even with the high transmission rate among poultry. Specifically, estimates of R0 were greater than 1 and the mean contact rate among poultry was 0.326 across all seasons and regions, whereas the daily chicken-to-human infection rate reflected by the linkage parameter γ indicated that the mean number of human infections per infectious chicken was 3.3 × 10-3. Our estimates of R0, among poultry were similar to those of past pandemic influenza viruses in humans (e.g. 1.2-2.3 for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) [23] , which implies that influenza A(H7N9) has the potential to cause pandemics in chicken populations. This result is similar to earlier findings [24] ; however, our estimates for three other parameters, the mean infectious period, the basic reproductive rate and the chicken-to-human infection rate, were smaller, which may be due to the finer spatial and longer temporal scales used in this study, as well as the difference in modelling approach. Specifically, our study used a dynamic model, Bayesian inference framework and regional bi-weekly counts of human infections, covering three epidemic waves. Our findings thus represent more detailed, localised and long-term patterns of transmission dynamic than earlier work using least-square methods in conjunction with daily human infection data at the beginning of the outbreak at a national scale [24] .\n"," The dynamic patterns of influenza A(H7N9) differed in the two regions studied here, although with the limited number of outbreaks available for validation, these differences must be interpreted with caution. The transmission potential among chicken flocks and initial susceptibility decreased across three seasons in the eastern region, but remained stable in the southern region. These differences were dynamically consistent with observed outbreak severity in both regions and may have been caused by a difference in control methods implemented by the government. In the eastern region, approaches such as closing of LBMs [25, 26] and halting live poultry trade were implemented during the early stages of the outbreaks. This probably reduced chicken-to-human exposure and chicken-tochicken mixing and consequently may have attenuated the severity of the outbreak. On the other hand, for southern provinces such as Guangdong (where LBM closure was implemented later, in the second half of February 2014), co-circulation of a diverse array of avian influenza subtypes as well as multiple strains of H7N9 and H9N2 influenza viruses has been documented. This abundance of viruses creates an environment primed for influenza reassortment, resulting in diversified and more adaptive genotypes and a higher risk of infections in both poultry and humans [27, 28] and may therefore keep susceptibility high and stable across seasons.\n"," The mean estimate of D, the mean infectious period, for the 2012/13 outbreak in the eastern provinces was lower (3.95) than for the later outbreaks, which ranged from 5.29 to 5.94. Given the limited number of total outbreaks investigated, the exact causes for this difference are difficult to pinpoint; however, factors could include actual changes to the virus between the first and later outbreaks, errors in the observed number of cases or errors in the estimation process. That the 2013/14 and 2014/15 outbreaks yielded consistent estimates, including similar values for D and β, and decreasing maximal S over time suggests that these findings are credible.\n"," Our inference and forecasting framework was implemented with a simple SIR model and the assumption of homogeneous mixing among human and chicken populations, i.e. a constant chicken-to-human transmission rate. Our model only simulated chicken-to-chicken and chicken-to-human transmission (Formulas 1-3) and did not consider environmental transmission. Given the limited data on infection and transmission among poultry, inferred distinctions of alternate transmission modes, i.e. chicken-to-chicken vs environment-to-chicken, are likely to be poorly constrained. Further, prior attempts to simulate these different pathways suggest that the rates of chicken-to-environment shedding are low [29] . Loss of immunity was not modelled either, as birds are either slaughtered or, when infection is suspected, culled, as required by the Chinese government [30] .\n"," Despite these shortcomings, the combined modelinference system matched the observations well, and provided sensible estimates of key epidemiological parameters, including rates of chicken-to-human spillover infection. The analyses revealed the transmission potential of H7N9 influenza among poultry, the stability and changes of that transmission potential over time, and that real-time forecasting of influenza A(H7N9) incidence in both human and poultry is possible. In the future, such methods could be applied in real time to newly emerged avian influenza subtypes.\n","Score: 7.171260899491886\n","\n","Title: Influenza-and Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Morbidity and Mortality in the Nursing Home Population\n","Body Text: utbreaks of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated illness are common in nursing home settings. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] In temperate climates like the United States, these two viruses are usually confined to winter and typically cause seasonal outbreaks of respiratory illness. [9] [10] [11] Nursing home residents are confined in close contact with one another and staff, presenting easy opportunity for viral spread. In addition, the high prevalence of comorbid conditions increases the risk of serious morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and RSV infections.\n"," The effect of influenza and RSV in the nursing home population is incompletely described despite the fact that institutional outbreaks of influenza and RSV are well documented. Winter outbreaks result in attack rates of 10% to 40% for both viruses, RSV case-fatality rates of 2% to 20%, and influenza case-fatality rates of up to 55%. 2, 5, 8, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] One prospective study in a single nursing home over the 1989-90 winter season identified RSV as the most common viral cause of acute respiratory illness in residents. It was documented in 27% of respiratory illnesses and was more common than influenza. 18 To date, studies of nursing home patients have included only a small number of homes, usually over fewer than three winter seasons. Thus, such information about the effects of influenza and RSV may not be typical of morbidity in most nursing home residents during most years.\n"," This study describes the first population-based study of the effect of influenza and RSV specifically in the nursing home population. A retrospective cohort study of all per-sons residing in Tennessee nursing homes enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program was performed to determine rates of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, antibiotic use, and deaths during 4 consecutive years, August 1995 through July 1999. The rates of these events due to influenza and RSV were estimated using active viral surveillance to determine times these viruses were circulating in Tennessee. Tennessee Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that insures approximately 80% of persons residing in the 381 nursing homes in the state. Computerized medical data on this large population allowed quantifying the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and RSV in the statewide nursing home population.\n"," Linked Tennessee Medicaid files were used to define the cohort and identify outcomes of interest as previously described. 19 The enrollment file included age, sex, race, dates of enrollment, and date of death. The nursing home file included name and location of nursing home, defined as urban (Tennessee's four largest cities), other standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA), or rural (non-SMSA), and dates of nursing home use. Pharmacy files provided records of all filled prescriptions. Inpatient files provided dates of all hospitalizations and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition with Clinical Modifications (ICD-9-CM)-coded discharge diagnoses.\n"," The study population included all persons enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program for at least 1 year from August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1999, who were nursing home residents. Persons younger than 65 were excluded because this population was small (16% of eligible persontime) and demographically different (54% male, 39% in mental health facilities, 65% with no comorbid condition) from older residents. Persons entered the study on the first day after August 1, 1995, on which they were enrolled in Medicaid for at least 1 year and a nursing home resident. Persons were followed until loss of enrollment, movement out of the nursing home, or death or until July 31, 1999.\n"," The exposure, or season of viral activity, was defined based on active viral surveillance in middle Tennessee. Two sources of viral surveillance were used: all positive antigen tests and cultures for influenza, RSV, or parainfluenza viruses from the Vanderbilt University Hospital laboratory were identified, and a cohort of about 150 children, aged 5 and younger, were followed annually in the Vanderbilt Vaccine Clinic and cultured for these three viruses whenever they developed fever or respiratory symptoms. This hospital serves as a referral hospital for middle Tennessee for adults and children. By protocol, all children hospitalized for respiratory symptoms are cultured for RSV; cultures for other viruses are not consistently collected. Thus these data may not accurately reflect the actual level of individual viral activity.\n"," Influenza season began the first day of 2 consecutive weeks with at least two influenza isolates per week and ended the last day of the 2 consecutive weeks with at least two influenza isolates per week. RSV season was similarly defined but excluded those dates classified as influenza season. In each of the 4 years, the dates of influenza season were completely encompassed by RSV season. Thus, all person time and events in the study occurred in one of three exposure periods: RSV season, when only RSV was circulating; influenza season, when both influenza and RSV were circulating; and non-winter-viral season, when neither RSV nor influenza was circulating.\n"," All person-time and events after a medical encounter with diagnostic or procedure codes or filled prescriptions indicating selected comorbid conditions were classified as high risk, including (1) asthma or chronic lung disease (ICD-9-CM codes 277.0, 770.7, 491-496) or prescriptions filled for ␤ -agonists, theophylline, inhaled corticosteroids, ipratropium, cromolyn sodium, or leukotriene inhibitors; (2) diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM codes 250) or prescriptions filled for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents; (3) chronic heart disease (ICD-9-CM codes 393-398, 402-404, 410-414, 415-417, 425, 428, 429, 745-747, except 747.5-747.9); (4) cancer/immunosuppressed (ICD-9-CM codes 140-208.9, except 173) or prescriptions filled for chemotherapeutic agents or 60 days of oral corticosteroids; (5) chronic renal or liver disease (ICD-9-CM codes 581-583, 585, 587, 571, 303 or dialysis procedure codes); and (6) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (ICD-9-CM code 042) or prescriptions filled for HIV medications. These comorbid conditions were chosen based on the current recommendations for influenza immunization. All other person-time and events were classified as not high risk.\n"," Study outcomes were cardiopulmonary hospitalizations (ICD-9-CM-coded discharge diagnoses of pneumonia (480-486), influenza (487), acute respiratory conditions (460-466), other respiratory conditions (490-519), heart failure or myocarditis (422, 427, 428)); the number of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions filled; and death. Mortality data were obtained from linkage of Medicaid files to State of Tennessee death certificates for those deaths that occurred between 1995 and 1998. Mortality data for deaths in 1999 were not yet available from Tennessee and thus were obtained from the Medicaid database. During 3 years, 1995-98, when death certificates were available, Medicaid files captured 96% of the deaths that were linked to Tennessee death certificates each of the 3 years.\n"," The total person-time and number of hospitalizations due to cardiopulmonary events were tabulated during influenza, RSV, and nonwinter seasons. All person-time was grouped into strata based on risk status (no high-risk and high-risk condition). Within each risk group, rates of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations were calculated by dividing the risk-group-specific sum of all hospitalizations due to cardiopulmonary events by the risk-group-specific total person-years during influenza, RSV, and non-winter-viral seasons. These and all other rates were expressed per 1,000 person-years and were adjusted for the proportion of the year in each of the three specific seasons. Differences in hospitalization rates during influenza and RSV seasons were calculated as measures of influenza-attributable risk. Similarly, the RSV-attributable risk was calculated as the difference between these rates during the RSV and non-winterviral seasons. Standardized rate differences were calculated as the weighted average of the strata-specific differences in rates. Confidence intervals were computed based on large sample properties. 20 Similar analyses were performed for antibiotic courses and death rates.\n"," Residents in Tennessee's 381 nursing homes contributed 81,885 person-years of follow-up during the 4 study years. Twenty-three percent of total person-years occurred during influenza seasons when RSV was also circulating, 26% occurred during RSV seasons when only RSV was circulating, and 51% occurred during the remaining non-winterviral seasons. Demographic characteristics of residents reflected a typical nursing home population; 73% were in intermediate care facilities, and 48% were in homes in rural locations ( Table 1 ). The residents were predominantly women (79%) and white (83%), and 63% had at least one high-risk condition. There were 402 cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, 2,416 courses of antibiotics, and 296 deaths per 1,000 person-years.\n"," The two viral surveillance systems detected 1,105 RSV culture or antigen-positive tests and 235 influenza culture or antigen-positive tests and 77 parainfluenza-positive cultures during the 4 study years. The onset of RSV season ranged from mid-September to early November and averaged 26 weeks in length. The onset of influenza season ranged from late November to early January and averaged 12 weeks in length. Influenza A H3N2 viruses circulated in all 4 years; in addition, influenza A H1N1 virus circulated in the first year, and influenza B viruses were detected in every year except 1997-98. There was a mean of 4.8 positive influenza tests per week during the influenza season. Only four ( Ͻ 2%) positive tests occurred outside this time. The average number of positive RSV tests was slightly higher in influenza season (11.2 per week) than in RSV season (9.6 per week). There were few positive RSV tests in non-winter-viral season (0.3 per week). Values are weighted averages of annual excess events for a population of 1,000 persons within the specified age and risk group. The influenza excess events were calculated by multiplying the event rate difference between influenza and RSV by the proportion of overall study days in influenza season. The RSV excess events were calculated by multiplying the event rate difference between RSV and non-winter-viral season by the proportion of overall study days in RSV or influenza season (RSV circulated during both of these seasons). The weighted average difference in rates between influenza and RSV season and RSV season and non-winter-viral season were calculated with stratumspecific person-years in all seasons as weights; strata were defined by study year, race, sex, and nursing home location. † Percentage values are calculated by dividing the annual excess events attributable to influenza or RSV by the age and risk-group specific total event rate.\n"," Cardiopulmonary hospitalization rates were consistently higher in influenza seasons than in non-winter-viral season and, except for the first year, higher in RSV seasons (Figure 1A) . For the 4 years combined (Table 2) , residents without and with identified high-risk conditions both experienced similar seasonal increases in hospitalizations, with the peak during the portion of the year when both influenza and RSV were present. Influenza was associated with an estimated seven and 28 cardiopulmonary hospitalizations per 1,000 person-years in those without and with high-risk conditions, respectively. RSV was associated with an annual excess of six and 11 hospitalizations per 1,000 person-years in these two strata. Together, influenza and RSV were responsible for 15% of hospitalizations in residents with no other defined high-risk conditions and 7% in those in the high-risk group.\n"," There was a consistent winter excess of antibiotic courses in both risk groups; the greatest antibiotic prescribing rate occurred when both influenza and RSV were circulating ( Figure 1B , Table 3 ). The estimated numbers of excess antibiotic prescriptions during influenza season were 99 and 147 per 1,000 person-years, for those without and with high-risk conditions, respectively. RSV season was associated with an annual excess of 62 and 76 courses of antibiotics in those without and with high-risk conditions. In both risk groups, 8% to 9% of all antibiotic courses were attributable to these two viruses.\n"," Seasonal death rates in the influenza and RSV seasons were consistently higher than death rates in non-winterviral seasons and consistently peaked during influenza seasons ( Figure 1C) . It was estimated that influenza caused six and 15 deaths per 1,000 residents without and with high-risk conditions, respectively (Table 4 ). Estimated mortality due to RSV was higher, 16 and 17 deaths per 1,000 in those without and with identified high-risk conditions, respectively. In addition, these two winter viruses accounted for 14% and 9% of all deaths in nursing home residents in the two risk groups.\n"," This is the first population-based study to quantify the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza virus or RSV in a statewide nursing home population. Previous population-based studies did not specifically examine the nursing home population, and earlier studies based entirely on nursing homes evaluated only one or a few homes. Morbidity and mortality from influenza and RSV vary from year to year, from community to community, and from institution to institution, and an accurate estimate of disease burden requires temporal, geographic, and institutional breadth. These data, which included all nursing homes, more accurately reflect average risk over time; in any given year, a single nursing home could experience a large outbreak or no illness at all due to either of these viruses. Cardiopulmonary hospitalizations are high in nursing home residents. Among the majority of residents who had at least one high-risk condition, there was one hospitaliza- Values are weighted averages of annual excess events for a population of 1,000 persons within the specified age and risk group.

Although rates of cardiopulmonary hospitalizations were more than six times higher in residents with high-risk conditions, the percentage of hospitalizations attributable to winter viruses was similar in both risk groups, at 5% to 15%. The absolute hospitalization rates and the approximately equal etiological contribution of RSV and influenza validate what others have found in national studies of the general population, using hospital discharge data, and prospective studies in single nursing homes or communities. 7, 17, 18, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Recent surveillance data in communities confirm that influenza and RSV cause substantial morbidity in all age groups, with the contribution of each varying from year to year. 11 Nursing home residents were prescribed an average of 2.4 antibiotic courses per year. Influenza and RSV are important contributors to the large number of prescriptions filled, with the two viruses responsible for more than 8% of all courses of antibiotics in both risk groups. Perhaps most remarkably, between 9% and 14% of all deaths in persons residing in nursing homes were associated with the circulation of these two viruses. The etiological role of each virus in these deaths was virtually identical.\n"," Another notable finding in this study was the overwhelming hospitalization, antibiotic use, and death rates of persons with chronic medical problems. Others have reported that persons with chronic illnesses are at significantly greater risk for influenza infection and its complications. 30, 31 This study substantiates the finding and demonstrates the increase in hospitalization, antibiotic use, and death rates in high-risk elderly during RSV season as well.\n"," Regional viral surveillance was used for the middle Tennessee region, primarily in children, to define influenza and RSV seasons for all nursing homes in the state. Thus, these definitions are only approximate estimates of when the viruses were circulating in the state, but strong correlations between the timing of national and regional influenza viral activity and morbidity and mortality are well recognized. 10, 30 National data indicate that RSV typically peaks in winter months, with widespread activity for up to 6 months, and that there are distinct regional patterns. 32 Thus, use of regional viral surveillance data in a largely pediatric population to define statewide viral activity is reasonable but likely results in some misclassification of seasons.\n"," It was also assumed that influenza and RSV caused all excess cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, antibiotic courses, and deaths occurring during their respective seasons. This assumption requires that other viruses that cause respiratory illnesses, such as parainfluenza, coronavirus, and rhinovirus, were evenly divided throughout the three defined seasons and thus would not contribute to the seasonal differences in rates. This assumption is reasonable because influenza and RSV are the two main respiratory viruses with strong seasonal variations. 9 In addition, the surveillance data indicated that parainfluenza was most active in non-winter-viral months, which would result in an underestimation of the \"excess\" winter events when using non-winter viral as the baseline. Neither coronavirus nor rhinovirus was included in the surveillance, and a differential distribution of these viruses could result in an over-or underestimation of the effects of influenza and RSV. Other winter factors, such as cold temperature and increased time indoors, would presumably not be important because nursing home residents encounter little seasonal environmental change.\n"," The winter-viral-associated increase in hospitalization, antibiotic use, and death rates found in this study are particularly troublesome in light of the high rate of influenza vaccination in the nursing home population. During the time period of this study, estimates of influenza vaccination rates in nursing home residents were 64% to 83%. 33, 34 Although continuing to improve vaccination rates may be helpful, future research efforts should focus on additional methods of reducing influenza disease such as increasing staff vaccination rates, improving detection and treatment of influenza outbreaks, and appropriate use of prophylactic measures.\n"," In adults, RSV is difficult to diagnose, and treatment is largely supportive. There is currently no RSV vaccine licensed, although several RSV candidate vaccines are in human trials. Efforts at RSV prevention and detection are hindered by a low degree of suspicion for this illness in elderly adults. This lack of awareness may prove to be the greatest challenge to decreasing the effect of this illness.\n"," The findings of this study have strong implications for future research efforts. The data reflect the need for continued study of influenza vaccine coverage, efficacy, and effectiveness and development and testing of candidate RSV vaccines in adults and children. Also, additional studies are needed to assess the role of education and other methods of prevention and treatment of illness due to both of these winter viruses in the nursing home population.\n","Score: 7.0960704644996815\n","\n","Title: Socioeconomic and environmental patterns behind H1N1 spreading in Sweden\n","Body Text: A novel pandemic emerged in Mexico during the spring of 2009, caused by a recombined influenza strain derived from circulating swine influenza strains. It spread quickly to other continents and struck Europe with a spring and summer wave, affecting several countries. The rate of transmission subsided as the summer progressed but accelerated again during the autumn season, this time in all European countries. The spread followed a west to east progression, a typical pattern for seasonal influenza 1 .\n"," The first cases in Sweden appeared late in April, and local transmission followed mainly in the major cities. In late September and early October, a nationwide outbreak started, peaking in November. From mid-May, the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control required mandatory reporting of individual cases, which later changed to hospitalized patients supplemented by laboratory notification of positive samples 2 . WHO declared the end of the pandemic on 10 August 2010. However, the mandatory reporting of the H1N1 pandemic strain continued in Sweden during the following five seasons, providing a detailed and thorough collection of epidemic data on a fine spatial resolution.\n"," The spatial component of many infectious diseases is crucial for the understanding of epidemic transmission. Recent years have seen a surge in mathematical modeling to describe the geographic transmission of infectious diseases [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Specifically, with the increasing availability of geo-tagged epidemiological data, the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza has been studied using spatially explicit models. For example, studies in the US have revealed how important human mobility patterns are for explaining influenza epidemic transmission [8] [9] [10] [11] . A previous geographic study of the pandemic spread over Sweden indicated a progression from the north to the south during 2009 12 . Morris et al. 13 investigated the relationship between the spatio-temporal spreading of seasonal influenza and demographic, geographic and climatic factors. However, their study focused on Norway and only conducted a joint analysis of the other Nordic countries on the county level.\n"," Meteorological factors associated with the rate of influenza transmission among individuals include precipitation, humidity, temperature, and sun radiation 12, [14] [15] [16] . However, uncertainties in the data remain, and meteorological drivers may play more significant roles in some geographic regions than others. The role of population size and density in cities is also known to affect the dynamics of influenza transmission and the weight of environmental factors 8, 16 . Apart from the importance of schoolchildren for influenza transmission 17 , socioeconomic factors important for influenza spread remain sparsely studied 18 .\n"," Our analysis covers Sweden on the geographical level of its 290 municipalities. Almost all the data sources are domestic and are available either on the municipality level (only the cities of Stockholm and Göteborg comprise more than one municipality) or the DeSo (demographic statistical areas) 25 level, a subdivision of the municipality level. The only exception is the weather-station based meteorological data, which we have converted from specific geographic coordinates to the municipality level. Because Sweden covers a large geographical area with significant variance in features, climate, and population, the selected indicators may vary significantly.\n"," Maps and geographical data. We Travel data. Travel patterns in the Swedish population have been recorded since the mid-1990s by interviewing representative selections of several thousand 6-84-year-old inhabitants. As part of this study, we obtained complete questionnaire data for the years 2011-2016 27 . The data contains posts on individuals' daily commuting habits with partial and whole trips and the geographic origin and target at the DeSo level. Since DeSos are subdivisions of municipalities, we converted them to the municipality level.\n"," Since this study considers the years from 2009 to 2015, we have used the 2011-2016 period to define the travel patterns for all parts of the analysis, including the years 2009 and 2010. We assume travel patterns did not change significantly between the years 2009 and 2011. Furthermore, while the sample size of the survey is adequate to calculate general statistics, it is too sparse to construct a travel network with temporal dynamics, even on a yearly level. Instead, we constructed an aggregated static network containing all feasible routes of infection. To partially compensate for the survey's inadequacies, we made sure that the travel network represents all air and rail travel routes and connects all neighboring municipalities.\n"," In order to include a variable representing travel frequency between the municipalities, we implemented the radiation model of Simini et al. 28 . This model uses the population size of areas and the distance between them to estimate the population movement between these areas. Epidemiological data. Our data set consists of all laboratory-verified cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 between May 2009 and December 2015, extracted from the SmiNet register of notifiable diseases, held by the Public Health Agency of Sweden. While the number of flu cases is regularly under-reported, the SmiNet database contains 16000 records, a reasonably large sample compared to other notifiable diseases. Due to confidentiality reasons, cases are anonymized, and addresses are aggregated at the DeSo level together with the date of diagnosis, age, and gender. To make sure the addresses represent the habitation at the time of diagnosis, Statistics Sweden (SCB) cross-referenced the register with a historical address register before anonymization. We obtained ethical approval for the data acquisition.\n"," Consequently, the epidemiological data contains the number of daily reported cases at the DeSo level, which we converted to the municipality level. Socioeconomic data. One of our main goals is to establish a relationship between socioeconomic factors and epidemic spreading. Since this study only considers Sweden, high-quality data is readily available from Sta- Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of indicators 1, 2, 3 and the population sizes of the municipalities of Sweden. Both population density and population size have been used before to model epidemic spreading 16 . In a geographical setting, population density is preferred due to its independence from inequalities in the size of geographical areas. In contrast, using population size can be misleading if differences are more than minimal. However, the fine geographical resolution of the municipalities of Sweden and the lack of huge population centers (except Stockholm and Göteborg) allow us to use population size as a variable. We experimented with both density and size in our study. We found that density only has a small contribution to the timing of the epidemic events, while population size is a significant factor. Therefore, we chose to include population size.\n"," Meteorological data. Even though the exact mechanisms are unknown, the relationship between environmental temperature and humidity and seasonal influenza is well established in the literature [14] [15] [16] 30 . As such, it is one of the key factors used in this study. Due to Sweden's geographical position and the Gulf Stream effect, the country's climate ranges from an oceanic climate in the far south to a subarctic climate in the far north, while central Sweden has a humid continental climate.\n"," We obtained detailed meteorological data from the European Climate Assessment Dataset 31 . This database contains daily meteorological station observations covering Europe. Of the elements available in the database, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ we included mean temperature and relative humidity converted to absolute humidity as factors in this study. We show the averaged mean temperatures and absolute humidity of a few select municipalities on Fig. 1C ,D.\n"," The GIIM method uses a network to represent the geographical areas involved in the outbreak. The nodes of the network are the geographical areas themselves, while the links represent possible routes of infection. In the GIIM model, attributes (or weights) can be assigned to both the nodes and the edges of the network; these are important parts of the model and usually represent factors or determinants potentially related to disease spreading. The last and most important input of the model is a set of reference observations from an actual outbreak, which take the form of a time series of values on the same geographical resolution as the nodes of the network. The goal of GIIM is to identify the transmission risks on the links of the network defined as a function of known attributes, and return the parameters of this function. The parameters are estimated with an iterative refinement approach. Starting from an initially random set of parameters, the method constructs a simulated outbreak and calculates a set of observations. These simulated observations are then compared to the reference observations and an error value is computed. Depending on the size of the error, the method either stops and returns set of edge infection probabilities, or it updates the set of parameters using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. In latter case, the process is repeated until the error between the simulated and reference observations is minimal. Fig. 3 shows a flowchart of the method.\n"," The GIIM method has been successfully applied to real-world problems 32 , including the modeling of the geographical spread and transmission of Zika in the Americas 23 . GIIM brings a novel approach to epidemic modeling because instead of merely simulating an outbreak, the method estimates an infection process's parameters and properties using observations from an actual outbreak. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Inputs. The GIIM method requires three inputs: an underlying network structure, attributes assigned to the nodes and edges of the network, and a set of observations on a real-life transmission process. The underlying network structure in this study represents the municipalities of Sweden. We denote graph G as G(V, E), where V G is a set containing all the vertices of the graph, while E G contains all the edges of the graph. We denote the edges of G as e uv ∈ E G with u as the origin and v as the destination of the edge, where u and v are nodes of the network and edge e uv links node u to v. The nodes of the network represent the 290 municipalities of Sweden, and we define the edges of the network based on the travel survey introduced in the data section. We created a directed edge between two municipalities A and B if at least one individual traveled from A to B. To ensure that we represented all feasible travel paths in the network, we connected all neighboring municipalities. In this way, the edges indicate significant recorded travel between the pair of municipalities they connect. We denote this network G S and illustrate it in Fig. 1A .\n"," Attributes. We represent the previously defined socioeconomic, travel, and meteorological factors as attributes assigned to the edges. All attributes are real values normalized between zero and one. The following attributes are assigned to each edge e uv :\n"," 1. F uv the estimated amount of travel between municipalities u and v according to the radiation model. Attribute function. To reconstruct the observed outbreak using the network and its attributes, GIIM repeatedly runs a simulated infection process. The infection process requires transmission probabilities (also called edge infection probabilities) w t uv ∈ [0, 1], e uv ∈ E G S assigned to the edges of the network. The flexibility of the GIIM model allows us to define these values as a function of known attributes. In this paper, we define the functions with the attributes listed above.\n"," The variables in Eq. (1) cover the attributes listed previously, while A denotes a constant. The optimization algorithm of GIIM estimates the coefficients of these functions. Note, that some of the attributes received a zero or close to zero weight during the optimization process. We left out these attributes from the final model. See the results section for a discussion of the final set of attributes and their coefficients.\n"," Reference outbreak. The GIIM method seeks to estimate the parameters of an actual outbreak. Information about this outbreak comes in the form of reference observations. While observations can take different forms 20 , here we define the reference observations as a set of binary column vectors, where each row corresponds to a municipality, i.e. a node in the network, while each vector represents a given time period. The goal in this paper is to estimate the timing of the epidemic onset, therefore each value in these binary vectors indicates if the onset has already happened in the corresponding municipality in the corresponding time period. A value of 1 indicates that the epidemic onset already happened, while a 0 indicates that it has not happened yet. The week of the onset has a value of 1. We identified the week in which the epidemic onset happened in each municipality manually, by marking the week when the number of confirmed cases doubled compared to the previous week.\n"," An example of a set of reference observations can be seen as follows.\n"," Each row corresponds to a municipality, t indicates a time period and there are t e time periods in total. The epidemic onset happened at t = 2 in municipality 2 and 3 and sometime later in municipality 1. Municipality 4 avoided the outbreak.\n"," We model the spreading of influenza on a weekly basis, therefore each time period (and each binary vector) references a specific epidemic week. However, the timing of the epidemic seasons varies depending on the year. Table 1 lists the weeks in each season when there was a significant number of flu cases. We used these weeks to In this study, we adopt the SI compartmental infection model defined for networks 20, 37 , which was successfully used to model the first occurrence of Zika 23 and the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic 24 . Part of the more general SEIR infection model family, the SI model only has two states: susceptible (S) and infected (I), representing infectious nodes, which continuously try to infect their healthy neighbors, and susceptible nodes prone to infection. Each node of the network has a state during the process, which may change over time. We assign edge infection probabilities w t uv ∈ [0, 1] to all edges of the network. The t time index indicates that these probabilities may change their values depending on the discrete time scale of the process. However, w t uv is strictly an input of the model and does not depend on the spreading process in any way. The infection process is iterative and takes place in a finite number of discrete time steps. In each iteration, a node may change its state depending on the state of its neighbors and the edge infection probabilities assigned to the edges connecting it to them. Nodes may change their states from susceptible to infected, but infected nodes stay infected until the end of the process. The total number of discrete time steps the process takes is limited to the number of weeks with reported new flu cases.\n"," As in Ref. 20, 23 , we define the SI infection model using a graph G(V, E) with edge infection probabilities w t uv assigned to all of its edges and the initial set of infected nodes A 0 . The rest of the nodes are in the susceptible state at the beginning of the process. Let A t ⊆ V G be the set of infected nodes in iteration t. In each iteration t each infected node u ∈ A t tries to infect all its susceptible neighbors v ∈ V G \\ A t depending on the edge infection probability w t uv of the edge connecting them. If the attempt is successful, v joins the set of infected nodes in the following iteration. If more than one node is trying to infect v in the same iteration, the attempts are made independently of each other in an arbitrary order within the same iteration. The process terminates naturally if all nodes reachable from the initially infected nodes with nonzero edge infection probabilities adopt the infected state, or when there are no more reported new flu cases.\n"," The above process defines a single instance of an outbreak. Instead of binary values, GIIM requires for each node the likelihood of being in an infectious state for all time steps. To estimate the likelihood of infection for each node at each time step, we run the SI model k times and compute for each time step the fraction of instances where the nodes were infected. This approach is similar to the ones used in 38, 39 . Following the observations in 39 and our previous experiences in 23 , we set k = 5000 . This setting provides good accuracy while reducing the overall runtime of the simulations. When we refer to the infection model's output, we refer to the estimated likelihood values as opposed to the binary outputs of a single instance.\n"," The GIIM method. The GIIM method 20 defines the problem of estimating edge infection probabilities as an optimization task. Its inputs include a network, several attributes on the nodes and the edges of the network, and a set of reference observations of an actual outbreak. GIIM provides an estimation of the observed outbreak by simulating one. Apart from the result of the simulation (which may be more detailed than the original), its output provides an assignment of edge infection probabilities and the relative importance of the attributes according to Eq. (1).\n"," To define GIIM's inputs, let o t denote a vector containing observations on an infection process. Let o t assign a value to all v ∈ V G . Let t ∈ T denote a discrete time stamp indicating the week in which the observation was taken, and T be the set of all time stamps. Let O denote the set of all observations � o t ∈ O for all t ∈ T . Let I denote the SI infection model introduced in the previous subsection, and W G : E G � → [0, 1] be the initially unknown assignment of edge weights to the edges of the graph. Finally, let Inf be a procedure, which makes www.nature.com/scientificreports/ observations on infection process I at sample times T, taking place on graph G with assigned edge weights w uv ∈ W, e uv ∈ E(G) . We denote Inf as O = Inf (G, W, I , T for all t ∈ T , calculating the AUC value for each pair and averaging over all pairs. The GIIM method uses an iterative refinement algorithm to solve the optimization task above. Starting from an initially random edge weight assignment, GIIM simulates an outbreak and compares the output with reference observations. Then it updates the edge weight assignments and repeats the process. The search algorithm uses the Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization method 21 , a multi-agent iterative optimization algorithm, which was previously shown to perform well with GIIM 20,23 . Algorithm 1 and Fig. 3 summarizes the GIIM algorithm.\n"," Estimating individual edges is difficult due to the size of most networks. To avoid this problem, GIIM defines the edge weights as a function of known attributes on the nodes or edges. This way, the goal of the optimization task is to find the coefficients of this function. GIIM also makes it possible to define dynamic attributes or edge weights, indicating that their value changes in time. In practice, this means that the edge weight or attribute is a function of t, a discrete time stamp corresponding to the actual iteration of the infection model.\n"," The general form of the edge function can b e written as w t uv = g(f 1 (a t 1 (e uv ), � c 1 ), f 2 (a t 2 (e uv ), c 2 ), . . . , f ℓ (a t ℓ (e uv ), c ℓ ), c g ) for all e uv ∈ E G A , where a t i (e uv ) represents the i-th attribute on edge e uv ∈ E G at iteration t of the infection process, ℓ denotes the number of available attributes, f 1 , . . . , f ℓ and g are functions and c 1 , . . . , c ℓ , c g are coefficients of functions f 1 , . . . , f ℓ , g . This formulation is easy to implement and allows us to assign different functions to different attributes, while the role of function g is to aggregate and normalize the results of the individual attribute functions to ensure they fall between 0 and 1. The value w t uv denotes the edge weights and C the set of all coefficient vectors. Using the function-based alternative greatly simplifies the optimization task, reducing the number of values we have to estimate from |W| = |E G | to |C|. However, its main advantage is that instead of providing a single individual value for each edge, it allows us to explore the relationship between the factors potentially related to the outbreak and the outbreak itself.\n"," Equation (1) defines the edge functions used in this study. We trim the weighted sums above 1 and below 0 by\n"," . To reduce the solution space of the PSO method and to make the results of individual test runs comparable, we bound all parameters between −0.5 and 0.5, except A, which we bound between −1 and 1.\n"," Ethics approval and consent to participate. All data were anonymized to be not retraceable to individuals by the Public Health Agency of Sweden before being accessed by the research team. Approval was granted by the Regional Ethical Committee in Umeå on 2015-10-20.\n"," We start our analysis by studying the spreading of H1N1 in the autumn of 2009 between weeks 37 and 50, corresponding to a period from mid-September to mid-December. We model the outbreak on a weekly basis and set up the input files of GIIM as described in the Inputs section. To partially account for the summer wave of infections in 2009, we select the municipalities of Stockholm, Malmo and Gothenburg as infected in the starting week of the analysis because these municipalities contained the most infected individuals during the summer wave. We use the attribute function defined in Eq. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ tions and functions. While we started our analysis with the function shown in Eq. (1), several of our input attributes received a coefficient close to zero. These were travel frequency ( F uv ), household income ( I v ) and social aid ( S v ). We excluded these variables from the final model in Eq. (2) . Figure 4 shows the mean of the coefficients assigned to the remaining risk factors, while Table 2 shows the mean, the minimum, the maximum and the standard deviation of these factors.\n"," The weights in Eq. (2) represent each risk factor's relative contribution to the transmission risk between the municipalities. The standard deviation of the coefficients across test runs is small except for absolute humidity. More importantly, the relative importance of the risk factors remains robust.\n"," The most significant factor in the timing of the epidemic onset is the population size of the municipalities, indicating that the disease reaches large population centers first and then spreads to the countryside. This result is in line with observations in the US and UK, where both population size and the more commonly used population density were already established as important contributors to this phenomenon 8 . Our results indicate that the importance of large population centers is far greater than identified in 13 , possibly because of the higher spatial resolution of our model in Sweden.\n"," Another significant risk factor is the incidence of H1N1 cases in the municipalities on the origin of the links. This coefficient is closely tied to the network-based structure of our model, which is similar to agentbased approaches 6, 7 and underlines the spatial structure of the spreading process, which we discuss in the next subsection.\n"," The contribution of the amount of travel between municipalities was close to zero in our initial model, thus the parameter was omitted from Eq. (2). This result is in line with the observations in 13 . The exact role of this indicator is debated in the literature. Some studies identify it as a minor factor 5,16,23 , while others emphasize its effect in local or global transmission 7, 8 . One possible explanation for its lack of importance here, is that our study only considers a relatively small geographical area, a single country having a well developed transportation infrastructure. Our results are also in line with the conclusions in 12, 23 , which states that the presence of a few infected travelers is enough to spread the disease to different regions.\n"," Meteorological factors such as temperature and humidity are known to play a critical role in the appearance of influenza 12, 16 . According to our model, a decrease in absolute humidity is one of the main driving factors in H1N1 spreading, while a drop in temperature provides a smaller contribution. This result confirms the findings of Skog et al. 12 , but contradicts the findings of Morris et al. 13 , which identified no such relationship. We provide www.nature.com/scientificreports/ two explanations for this: First, our model offers a much higher spatial resolution for Sweden than the model in 13 . Second, the high-resolution results of Morris et al. apply to Norway, which has a different climate closer to the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Current with the Scandinavian Mountains separating the two countries. Perhaps due to the relative homogeneity of a single country, we found that the effect of the socioeconomic variables on the transmission risk between municipalities to be minimal. The average number of school-age children per household, which is a well-known risk factor 17 , showed the most significant influence. The influence of both income and social aid is close to zero in our model. However, median income and social aid at the municipality level might not be sufficiently sensitive indicators to measure the inequalities in Swedish society.\n"," We conclude that the three variables that influence the timing of the epidemic onset the most are population size, the number of cases in neighboring municipalities and a decrease in the absolute humidity of the environment. This result is in line with the spreading mechanism of agent-based simulations where the outbreak travels from region to region after infecting a certain amount of people locally, favoring population centers 6, 7 . Temperature also has a small negative effect, while school-aged children have a small positive effect. Exportation, importation and route level risk. The edge infection or transmission probabilities between the municipalities of Sweden are among the outputs of GIIM. It is possible to define a node-based import and export risk weight by aggregating the edge-based risk values on the in-and out-edges of each node. This value is also known as node strength. These values are not probabilities but risk indicators of importing or exporting the disease from or to a municipality. They represent a relative weight that allows us to rank the municipalities. Figure 5 shows exportation, importation and route level risk for a few select municipalities, while Fig. 5A shows their location in Sweden. Figure 5B illustrates the time-dependent exportation risk values for some of the highest risk municipalities in onset estimation. Large population centers appear at the top of the list. While Göteborg and Stockholm remain at the top, Malmö only stays in the top 20 exporters during the initial weeks, with its relevance decreasing even more later in the outbreak. Other larger cities include Linköping, Jönköping and Uppsala, although their relevance fades in time except for Uppsala. Several of the larger cities of northern Sweden, such as Skellefteå, Umeå, and Gävle, are top exporters until mid-November, partially confirming the observations in 12 . Figure 5C illustrates the time-dependent importation risk values for some high-risk municipalities in onset estimation. This ranking is more static than the export ranking, with large population centers remaining high risk until the end of the outbreak. These cities include Linköping, Jönköping, Norrköping, Uppsala, Örebro and Västerås, together with a few northern municipalities such as Umeå, Gävle and Sundsvall. In contrast to the export risk ranking, Stockholm county and Västra Götaland are not top-import municipalities. However, our model only considers domestic travel patterns in Sweden, therefore the risk of importation from international travellers is not included in our analysis. This fact may explain the seemingly low risk of importation in Stockholm.\n"," Due to a large number of edges in the graph, it is difficult to highlight the individual links most important to the outbreak. Figure 5D shows some of these links. For example, early in the outbreak, links connecting to Uppsala appear most prominently among links to Umeå, Linköping, Örebro and Västerås. This pattern remains until the end of the outbreak. Starting from mid-October, links connecting the municipalities of Northern Sweden appear at the top of the edge-based risk ranking and stay there for several weeks until mid-November. At the end of our observation period, links connecting larger population centers in South and Central Sweden dominate the top of the ranking.\n"," Our observations on the timing of the epidemic onset of H1N1 in the fall of 2009 follow a loose geographical pattern. Following the smaller summer wave of infections, the disease stays in the largest cities. From September, it begins slowly spreading to the other larger population centers of South and Central Sweden and a few cities in Northern Sweden. A massive burst of the outbreak happens in mid-October, reaching the countryside in South and Central Sweden and moving north along the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, infecting the larger population centers on its way. After peaking in most of the country in early and mid-November, the outbreak first ends in the north and finally in the largest cities where it began.\n"," Model accuracy. We evaluated the accuracy of our model by independently computing the ROC AUC value for each week of the estimation process. The averaged AUC value for all 14 weeks of the observation period was 0.875, indicating a good fit. Figure 6 shows individual AUC values for all weeks. The estimation is easy during the first weeks due to the small number of positive examples. In most municipalities, the fall H1N1 outbreak started and peaked in weeks 42-45. In these weeks, the accuracy of the estimation process drops to around 0.82, indicating some uncertainty in the exact timing of the onset, stabilizing around 0.85 in the second half of the observation period.\n"," Model predictability. To demonstrate the robustness of our approach, we use the attribute function with estimated coefficients from the 2009 outbreak in conjunction with the infection model to predict the timing of the epidemic onset in the influenza outbreaks in epidemic seasons 10/11, 12/13, 13/14, 14/15. We omitted season 11/12 from our analysis due to the small number of H1N1 cases in that season. We updated our dynamic input attributes to match the actual temperature and humidity values in the periods. We also defined the infection sources for each of the target seasons and estimation types by selecting the three municipalities with the earliest appearance of the disease.\n"," To test the accuracy of our predictions, we set up the reference observations for our four target seasons in the same way as for the 09/10 season (for observation periods of these seasons, see Table 1 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ infection model for each season, we compared their output with the corresponding reference observations by computing the ROC AUC metric. As shown in Fig. 7 , the average AUC values for all successive seasons stay close or even exceed the accuracy we have seen in the 2009 pandemic. The individual AUC values present a similar picture, although the trends inside epidemic seasons differ somewhat from those in Fig. 6 , with accuracy slowly decreasing as the outbreak progresses but stabilizing well above 0.8. The predictive accuracy is higher in the 13/14 and 14/15 seasons than in the first two. While the weakening immunity granted to the population by the 09/10 pandemic may explain this trend, our results do not provide conclusive evidence to confirm this hypothesis.\n"," According to our findings, the spreading of H1N1 in Sweden was mainly driven by large population centers, the presence and size of outbreaks in neighboring municipalities and the meteorological factors humidity and temperature. Confirming observations in 13, 23 , the amount of travelers is not an important factor. This result may be due to the relatively small geographical scope of the study and the well-developed infrastructure of the country. Supporting existing results on the effect of meteorological factors in influenza spreading 12, 16 , absolute humidity plays a critical role in our model, while mean temperature contributes less. The only other socioeconomic indicator that contributes noticeably to our model is the number of children per household, confirming the observations in 17 . The effect of the rest of the socioeconomic factors, income and social aid, is close to zero. However, the spatial resolution of our model might be too low to identify their contribution. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Compared to other studies discussing the role of socioeconomic, climate and travel indicators in influenza spreading in the Nordic countries, we confirm most of the observations of Skog et al. 12 and some of Morris et al. 13 . Due to the radically different methodology used in these studies, a more direct comparison is not within the scope of this paper. We also extended these previous works by examining the effect of a larger set of indicators and providing an analysis of the most critical travel routes involved in the spreading of influenza.\n"," While our model is constructed based on the 2009 pandemic, we can make accurate predictions on the timing of the selected epidemic events in the following seasons. Therefore, our model can be used as a realtime decision support tool advising on resource allocation and surveillance. Furthermore, while our study only considers H1N1 spreading, it can be adapted to model other influenza strains or respiratory infections with a similar transmission mechanism.\n"," The input and output data used in this paper can be found at http:// snd. gu. se/ en/ catal ogue/ study/ 2021-282\n"," The implementation of the proposed algorithm is available on request from the authors. \n","Score: 7.020887331667705\n","\n","Title: Can long-term historical data from electronic medical records improve surveillance for epidemics of acute respiratory infections? A systematic evaluation\n","Body Text: We simulated surveillance systems aimed at discovering modeled influenza outbreaks injected into backgrounds of patients with ARI. Backgrounds of daily case counts were either synthesized or obtained by applying one of three previously validated ARI case-detection algorithms to authentic EMR entries. From the time of outbreak injection, detection statistics were applied daily on paired background+injection and background-only time series. The relationship between the detection delay (the time from injection to the first alarm uniquely found in the background+injection data) and the false-alarm rate (FAR) was determined by systematically varying the statistical alarm threshold. We compared this relationship for outbreak detection methods that utilized either 7 days (early aberrancy reporting system (EARS)) or 2-4 years of past data (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time series modeling).\n"," In otherwise identical surveillance systems, SARIMA detected epidemics sooner than EARS at any FAR below 10%. The algorithms used to detect single ARI cases impacted both the feasibility and marginal benefits of SARIMA modeling. Under plausible real-world PLOS \n"," Outbreaks due to novel strains of influenza [1] [2] [3] or coronavirus [4, 5] illustrate why we must remain vigilant toward epidemics of acute respiratory infections (ARI). ARI epidemics need be recognized as soon as possible if prevention and mitigation measures are to be effective [6, 7] . The electronic medical record (EMR) includes numerous entries (e.g. clinical notes, vital signs, diagnostic codes, test results) that could combine to facilitate the discovery of individual cases [8, 9] or outbreaks of ARI [10] . In integrated health delivery systems, EMR data originate across the continuum of care, from ambulatory visits to intensive care units. A monitoring system rooted in such a comprehensive EMR implementation could provide early insight into outbreak severity and support the flow of information necessary to manage specific patients as well as the overall epidemic [11] [12] [13] .\n"," With the EMR fast becoming commonplace [14] , long-term EMR-derived datasets will soon be routinely available. In this context, we asked if statistical methods that consider longterm EMR data patterns could benefit ARI epidemic detection. Because most ARI result from viral diseases that exhibit marked seasonality, we hypothesized that fitting multi-year timeseries of daily ARI case counts with seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SAR-IMA) models [15, 16] could accelerate epidemic detection, compared to methods that base their forecasting on the recent past only [17] . To begin to test this hypothesis, we used software to recreate surveillance systems operating prospectively on synthetic or authentic historical datasets. Our results suggest that, under realistic surveillance conditions, SARIMA could help shorten outbreak detection delay.\n"," The Institutional Review Boards of the Veterans Administration (VA) Maryland Health Care System and the University of Maryland approved this study. The study was granted a waiver of consent, as risks were limited to information confidentiality, because the research-related risks were minimal and did not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants, and because the work would not have otherwise been feasible, given the large number of participants. All EMR information was de-identified prior to simulations and analyses, which used only daily case counts. s17 and the s33 time series, which mimic typical surveillance data for ARI such as pneumonia, influenza or influenza-like illness, with lower counts on weekend and holidays, long-term increase in counts and seasonality [18] . The synthetic outbreaks \"08\" (Log Normal) or the \"04\" (Inverted Log Normal) served as the epidemic signal to be injected. Characteristics of the synthetic backgrounds are summarized in Table 1 . The datasets are provided as supplementary material (S1 File).\n"," Authentic backgrounds. EMR entries were extracted from Veterans Integrated Service Technology Architecture hierarchical databases (MDE v.6.1.0.0, Strategic Reporting Systems, Inc. Peabody MA) and transferred to relational databases (SQL Server 2008, Microsoft Corp, Redmond CA). We used case detection algorithms (CDA) previously developed against a manual record review seeking reference ARI cases, defined as: [Positive influenza culture/antigen OR Any two of the following, of no more than 7 days duration: cough; fever or chills or night sweats; pleuritic chest pain; myalgia; sore throat; headache] AND Illness not attributable to a non-infectious etiology [8] . We chose the following ARI CDAs: a) CDA1 (sensitivity 63%, positive predictive value (PPV) 13%) retrieved outpatient visits where provider assigned a diagnostic code (International Classification of Diseases, 9 th version) included in an ARIrelated set used by a surveillance system of national scope [19] ; b) CDA2 (sensitivity 69%, PPV 54%) retrieved outpatient visits assigned a diagnostic code that belonged to a grouping modified for increased performance at the VA [8] ), and where automated text analysis of the visitrelated clinical note(s) identified at least two symptoms from the above ARI case definition [8, 20] . CDA2 was chosen because its use resulted in the highest epidemic detection performance amongst eight (8) alternative ARI case-detection methods [10] , illustrating the gains in system performance that could be achieved by combining different EMR data fields compared to using diagnostic codes alone; c) CDA3 retrieved CDA2 patients subset with a core body temperature of more than 37.8˚C measured on the day of their index visit (sensitivity 71%, PPV 68%). Our rationale for choosing CDA3 was that while its high performance could translate into timely epidemic detection, low daily case counts could represent a challenging substrate for time series modeling. To generate CDA-specific time series of daily case counts, each ARI CDA was applied to a relational database containing EMR documentation of outpatient clinical encounters [8] over a 7-year period, from January 1999 to December 2005. These time series formed the basis for the authentic \"backgrounds\" used for the whole-system simulations (see Fig 1A ( insert), Table 1 , and S1 File). EMR data included in CDA 1-3 have been extracted daily at the VAMHCS. Thus, any of the CDA tested could be incorporated in a prospective surveillance system.\n"," We developed an epidemic model of influenza to supply a plausible outbreak signal with which we could compare alternative surveillance system constructs [10] . The model includes coupled series of differential equations [21] adjusted to describe an epidemic of severe, 1918-like influenza, propagating through a susceptible population with the size, age structure, and age-specific birth and death rates described for Baltimore, MD [10] . The proportion of community cases presenting to the VA Maryland Health Care System was adjusted to reflect the age, gender, and population estimates of Baltimore veterans, over half of whom are older than 60 years old and more than 90% are male [22] . The model, its settings and documentation are provided as S2 File). Prior to injection, the modeled epidemic case counts were first discounted by the known sensitivity of the ARI CDA used to generate the background cases [8] . Fig 1A shows an example of the modeled influenza outbreak injected into an authentic background.\n"," Simulations of surveillance systems. We wrote software to simulate prospective surveillance systems operating on the authentic historical background datasets described above (R v. 2.10.1, http://www.r-project.org). The software began a surveillance cycle on the day when the modeled epidemic signal was injected into a background time series. Starting on the injection day, and then daily for a total of 80 days, a statistical outbreak detection method (see below) was applied in parallel to the background+epidemic (Combined) time series, and to the \"Background-only\" time series. The value of the statistic for each day was stored for subsequent analysis. The 80-day surveillance cycle was repeated, each time shifting the outbreak injection to a different week of the two, one-year study periods (from August 1 st 2002 to July 31 st 2003, and from August 1 st 2003 to July 31 st 2004). In a final phase, the software applied a family of threshold values beyond which the computed daily statistics would constitute an \"alarm\". On a given day and for a given threshold, an alarm that originated in the Background-only time series was considered a \"false alarm\". An alarm present in the Combined dataset but absent from the Background-only dataset was considered a \"true alarm\" (Fig 1B and 1C) . For a given alarm threshold, the software computed two benchmarks: 1) the \"Detection Delay\", the time from outbreak injection to the first true alarm, averaged for the 52 weekly surveillance cycles for a given one-year study period; 2) the daily false alarm rate (FAR), defined as the number of unique false alarms during the evaluation year, divided by 365 days. Corresponding pairs of Detection Delay and FAR were computed over broad ranges of alarm thresholds and used to plot CDA-specific activity monitoring operating characteristic (AMOC) curves [23] .\n"," Outbreak detection statistics. We compared two statistical approaches to detect the addition of the modeled epidemic signal to the backgrounds: 1) the early aberration reporting system (EARS) W2c [24] , which made predictions using data from the past 7 days of the relevant time series; and 2) seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models [25] , which used 2-4 years of past data.\n"," EARS. Daily case counts were first separated into two time series, one for weekdays and another for weekends/federal holidays. For a given day, the W2c statistic is expressed as\n"," where t is the time series index, Y(t) is the observed case count on that index day, \" Y ðtÞ and S(t) are a 7-day moving sample mean and standard deviation calculated with a 2-day lag from the index day. The value of S(t) was replaced by 1 if S(t) < 1.\n"," SARIMA. We used the Box-Jenkins method [15, 26] to develop separate SARIMA models (SAS v. 9.1, SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC) for the weekdays and weekends background time series corresponding to the s17 and s33 datasets (January 1 st 1994 to December 31 st 1997) or retrieved via each of the three ARI CDAs (from January 2, 1999 to August 13, 2002) . Models were of the form \"SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s\", which abbreviates the following equation:\n"," where B is the backshift operator; y t is the observation at time t; ε t is a sequence of \n"," is a moving average polynomial of order q for the non-seasonal component; F Ã P ðBÞ ¼ ð1 À 0 Ã 1 B s À 0 Ã 2 B 2s À Á Á Á À 0 Ã p B Ps Þ is an autoregressive polynomial of order P for the seasonal component; D is the order of the seasonal differencing; and Y Ã Q ðBÞ ¼ ð1 À y Ã 1 B s À y Ã 2 B 2s À Á Á Á À y Ã Q B Qs Þ is a moving average polynomial of order Q for the seasonal component. The cyclic periods were taken as 364 days [27] , 260 days and 104 days for years, weekdays and weekends, respectively. Before model-fitting, times series were modified as follows: 1) occasional high counts (n = 2-4 per year) and low counts for federal holidays were replaced by the average of the past three daily counts from the relevant time series; 2) a square root transformation was applied to make the data series stationary in both mean and variance, and thus satisfy model assumptions [16, 26] .\n"," Putative models were explored interactively to search for the most appropriate SARIMA form for each time series. The models coefficients were then estimated and their statistical significance evaluated. Some coefficients of the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) at lags of 260 and multiples of 260 were statistically significant, confirming that seasonal model components should be included. Overall model adequacy was assessed by comparing model-generated counts to the actual counts used for model building. SARIMA models were finally retained for surveillance implementation when they best fulfilled the following criteria: 1) minimum Akaike's Information Criterion value; 2) minimum mean absolute deviation of errors; 3) minimum root mean square root error; 4) normality of residuals; 5) parsimony. Each of the sixteen SARIMA models was used daily to forecast the next day's case count in their respective times series during the study periods. With each passing day, the models updated themselves to incorporate the latest information into the forecasting procedure.\n"," The final SARIMA models for weekday ARI counts were of the form SARIMA (1,0,1) (0,1,1) 260 for CDA1 and CDA2, but were of a different form for the synthetic backgrounds i.e. SARIMA (0,1,1)(1,0,1) 260 and SARIMA (1,0,1) (1,0,1) 260 for the s17 and the s33 time series, respectively. Models for the weekend ARI counts were all of the form SARIMA (1,0,1) (0,1,1) 104 . Case counts retrieved by CDA3 were low, and did not allow SARIMA modeling.\n"," In an initial set of simulations, we utilized either the EARS or the SARIMA outbreak detection methods on synthetic time series that exhibited seasonal increases in case counts typical of ARI. As expected, lowering the statistical alarm threshold decreased the time it took to discover the injected outbreak but increased the false-alarm rate (FAR). As the AMOC curves shown in Fig 2 illustrate , the relationship between the detection delay and the FAR was not linear, with a change around a low FAR producing a greater change in outbreak detection delay than a similar change around a high FAR.\n"," The SARIMA method discovered the injected outbreaks faster than EARS did, at any FAR below 10% (compare EARS (open black symbols) to SARIMA (closed red symbols) for the s17 (Fig 2A) or the s33 backgrounds (Fig 2B) ). The timeliness advantage of SARIMA over EARS became increasingly pronounced at FARs below 2%, where real-world surveillance systems would be expected to operate.\n"," To determine if the performance gains observed with SARIMA in all-synthetic contexts would translate into meaningful real-world benefits, we modified the simulations in two ways: 1) we ran previously validated ARI CDAs on a repository of our own EMR data to generate authentic historical time series of ARI cases [8] ; 2) we modeled an epidemic of severe influenza centered in Baltimore to create an ARI outbreak that could plausibly be experienced by our health system. To gain insight into year-to-year variation in system performance, we performed surveillance simulations over two different one-year time periods: a) 8/2002-7/2003, a year with an average ARI incidence; and b) 8/2003-7/2004, a year with a high seasonal incidence of ARIs. In keeping with prior observations [10] , EARS-based surveillance exhibited a better performance when using CDA2 for ARI case detection than when using CDA1, with consistently shorter outbreak detection delay at any FAR for both study periods (in Fig 3, Fig 3A (2002-03) and Fig 3B (2003-04) ; for CDA2, compare open black to closed red squares in Fig 3C (2002-03) and Fig 3D  (2003-04) ). Gains in timeliness due to SARIMA were highest at low FAR and were larger for CDA1 than for CDA2 (in Fig 3, compare the distance between the black and red tracings in panels A and B to that in panels C and D). Examination of the AMOC curves in Fig 3 suggests that at the commonly used daily FAR of 1%, SARIMA could reduce detection delay by~14-16 days for CDA1, and by~5 days for CDA2.\n"," To gain further insight into the practical usefulness of incorporating long-term historical data for ARI surveillance, we extended the CDA2-based surveillance system forward in time to include the summer of 2009, when the first wave of a pandemic of a novel H1N1 influenza strain (pH1N1) reached the US [2] . We avoided the time period immediately following the public announcement of the pandemic, as this period contained many visits from worried individuals but only sporadic laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases. Our comparison period thus began on May 24 and ended August 22, before the very large second wave of the epidemic reached Baltimore. During this period, there were peaks in laboratory-based surveillance for pH1N1 in Baltimore, MD, but no corresponding local peak of ARI visits observed in CDC's BioSense syndromic surveillance system.\n"," During the summer 2009 comparison period, SARIMA identified more true-positive alarms than EARS at any FAR below 10% (Fig 4A) . The example shown in Fig 4B highlights additional true positive alarms uncovered by SARIMA that were missed by EARS (red dots). Time-series modeling for ARI surveillance Within this FAR range, both EARS and SARIMA identified the first true positive alarm, a large peak of ARI cases occurring 10 days into the comparison period. Thus, for this particular outbreak signal, the more sensitive SARIMA method offered no timeliness advantage over EARS.\n"," In this work, we found that modeling long-term trends and seasonality in disease incidence with SARIMA can improve the performance of EMR-based influenza surveillance compared to EARS, a method that considers the recent past only. The algorithms used to detect single ARI cases impacted both the feasibility of SARIMA modeling and the magnitude of the SAR-IMA-related gains in detection timeliness. Under plausible conditions for our local health system, SARIMA could speed up epidemic detection by several days, a meaningful improvement considering how rapidly influenza can spread through a community [28] .\n"," If the need for a software framework to assess surveillance systems has previously been recognized [29] , we could find no published precedent for a modular test bed where both caseand outbreak-detection methods can be interchanged. Because adjustments in statistical alarm thresholds are method-specific and their effect on FAR unpredictable, we used simulations to determine the relationship between FAR and detection delay empirically. A graphical representation of this relationship intuitively informed a performance trade-off of key concern to public health practitioners.\n"," Many statistical aberrancy detection methods have been described for epidemic surveillance [17, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , including time series modeling [31, 35, 36] . Some of these methods have been applied to the same data sets and formally compared [18, [37] [38] [39] [40] . Of the two studies that addressed the value of historical data, a generalized linear model (GLM) that took advantage of 3 years of past data often outperformed EARS [39] , whereas a seasonally adjusted cumulative sum (CUSUM) method did not [18] . Even though a number of explanations could help reconcile these results, we note that as the size of an epidemic signal increases relative to the background noise, outbreak recognition becomes easier and the performance of alternative detection methods becomes more and more difficult to distinguish [39, 41] . This rationale could explain why the GLM approach implemented by Jackson et al. did not add value under all conditions, but performed well with slow-escalating outbreaks qualitatively similar to the one used in our study [39] . In our particular real-world case, we found SARIMA to be more sensitive than EARS at discovering signals related to the pH1N1 pandemic wave that hit Baltimore in the summer of 2009. However, there was no associated timeliness advantage to SAR-IMA, as the initial peak of ARI cases was large enough to be picked by both statistical approaches. Given the variability in real-world outbreak signals, a negative finding for one specific outbreak does not reduce the impetus to design ever more sensitive and specific surveillance systems.\n"," We compared a CDA that used diagnostic codes, a staple data type for public health surveillance, to a CDA that took advantage of the EMR to cross-validate diagnostic codes with ARI symptoms documented in related clinical notes [8] . Our results extend our prior findings that EMR-enabled gains in case-detection performance can translate into faster outbreak detection [10] , adding that further timeliness can be achieved by incorporating historical data. Because we had previously measured the performance of these CDAs relative to a large reference record review [8] , we could augment the realism of our simulations by discounting the injected epidemic according to CDA sensitivity. This simulation framework supplied information that may prove helpful to public health practitioners: 1) insight into the achievable gains in detection timeliness could help justify investing into more complex epidemic detection approaches;\n"," 2) AMOC curves could be used to: a) adjust outbreak detection sensitivity according to a local jurisdiction's capacity to investigate alerts; or b) to estimate how much resources should be reallocated to surveillance activities during periods of increased threat [42] .\n"," Our results are confined to our experimental conditions and do not represent the final evolution of our own surveillance system, as we did not optimize individual system components, such as diagnostic code groupings, text analyses, case-or outbreak-detection approaches. The CDA-and SARIMA-related gains in detection timeliness may be related to characteristics of the epidemic, to the EMR software itself as well as to peculiarities in medical practices, care documentation and reimbursement. The EMR software and the processes of care that it supports could change over time. Thus, the performance of EMR-based systems may be more prone to variations than simpler systems, such as those based on stereotyped emergency room chief-complaints. The methods described in this work lack disease specificity compared to laboratory-based methods. Nevertheless, automated methods can incorporate available laboratory results and identify outbreaks for which diagnostic tests are not available. Their comparatively low costs also allow broad populations to be continuously monitored.\n"," Modeling long-term historical data with time series statistical methods can shorten the time it takes for an EMR-based surveillance system to discover epidemics of ARI. The empirical approach used to evaluate alternative surveillance systems may represent a useful blueprint for the growing efforts to harness the EMR to benefit public health [43] .\n"," Supporting information S1 File.

The Centre for Infectious Disease Control (CIb), part of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), is responsible for the coordination of current infectious disease control activities, in close collaboration with a large number of professionals and organizations, in case of an outbreak or an epidemic that cannot be controlled by the involved Public Health Service (PHS) alone because of the (anticipated) severity or extent of the event. There are 28 PHSs in The Netherlands, each one under municipal authority, organized in seven larg-er public health regions. To optimize collaboration, each of the seven regions has identified a public health doctor and a regional microbiologist as a liaison with the CIb; these 14 regional professionals have a part-time appointment at the CIb. The CIb also has the task of setting up an outbreak management team (OMT), consisting of fixed members and additional experts invited personally, in the case of a novel or unexpected outbreak of infectious diseases that may spread nationwide. To prepare for a potential outbreak and to support daily control activities, a response team can be formed immediately at the CIb after the first signs of an outbreak. The Health Council of The Netherlands is an independent scientific advisory body that provides the government and parliament with advice on issues concerning public health, including vaccination strategies.\n"," To guide pandemic preparations, static and dynamic mathematical transmission scenario studies had been conducted to estimate the potential impact on society and on the healthcare sector under various assumptions of a new human influenza pandemic [1, 2] .\n"," Then, in 2003, The Netherlands was unexpectedly confronted by a large outbreak of influenza A/H7N7 among poultry. Outbreak investigations were initiated, diagnostics were developed, and extensive control measures were implement-ed to stop transmission. This resulted in the culling of 30 million birds, 89 human infections were confirmed, and one casualty occurred [3] .\n"," This experience-as well as the threat of the SARS coronavirus in 2003, an ongoing threat of influenza A(H5N1), and the need to implement the new International Health Regulations-resulted in the development of multidisciplinary protocols for surveillance, diagnostics, communication, control, and research aimed at the various phases of a potential influenza pandemic. All were developed in close collaboration with regional laboratories and health services, and with the veterinary sector (since an avian introduction was considered highly likely) [4] .\n"," Thus, when the 2009 pandemic outbreak occurred, The Netherlands, with its 16.5 million inhabitants, should have been well prepared to monitor and control the outbreak. Here, we discuss several aspects of the actual management, with specific attention to vaccination strategies, and reflect on the lessons learned. nication tools, preparing research protocols, stockpiling of antivirals, and arrangements for advance purchase of pandemic vaccinations and for the distribution logistics.\n"," Three separate multidisciplinary evidence-based response guidelines had been developed coordinated by the CIb for the public health sector: one dealing with incidental introduction (with a focus on avian influenza, in view of the 2003 experience), another with a focus on dealing with early introduction of a potentially pandemic virus, and a third one to guide public health management during pandemic transmission. In these guidelines, detailed operational information for professionals on how to manage cases and to control transmission was given, and reference was made to the need for surveillance, diagnostic capacity, correct use of antivirals, and prioritizing of vaccinations.\n"," Furthermore, the professional organizations of general practitioners (GPs) [5] , nursing home physicians, and occupational health physicians had prepared their own guidelines in line with the public health guidelines. On a regional level, the safety regions developed pandemic plans in cooperation with the PHSs. In all regions these plans were audited by the Dutch Health Inspectorate using a fixed set of indicators. The Ministry of Health in liaison with the Ministry of Interior Affairs prepared intersectoral contingency planning, and private companies drafted their own contingency plans. The ministry together with the CIb prepared communication leaflets for the general public and an extensive set of Q&As, to be finalized and updated should a pandemic emerge.\n"," Routine surveillance of influenza was already strong in The Netherlands, with a sentinel GP network coordinated by NIV-EL (Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research) covering around 1% of the population dating back to 1970 providing influenza-like illness (ILI) trends by age, sex, and region [6, 7] . Since the 1992/1993 influenza season, in a subsample of ILI patients, centralized virology testing has been performed at the RIVM/CIb with additional data on vaccination and selected comorbidity available. To strengthen this, efforts were made to increase the number of participating GPs, to increase the amount of sampling, and to develop a more systematic approach to sampling and data collection. To enable surveillance of more severe outcomes, GPs monitoring ILI were also asked to monitor pneumonia. Furthermore, a sentinel nursing home network was started in 2006, which included influenza/ILI and pneumonia surveillance, similar to the GP sentinel surveillance [8] .\n"," Influenza virus surveillance is also routinely undertaken by the Erasmus Medical Centre at Rotterdam University, where influenza virus isolates are typed and analyzed from hospitalized patients as well as ILI patients presenting to sentinel outpatient services, providing input for WHO vaccine selection. Erasmus Medical Center together with RIVM/CIb forms the Dutch National Influenza Centre (NIC), which collaborates with NIV-EL for the GP sentinel surveillance. Together they ensure continuous online weekly updates of the influenza situation and weekly newsletters are provided during influenza epidemics. At Erasmus Medical Center, viruses from the sentinel surveillance and from selected hospitalized patients are subtyped on a routine basis. In the preparation for a potential emergence of antiviral resistant virus variants, if (stockpiled) antivirals would be widely used, the NIC developed assays to detect such variants [9, 10] . Using these assays, the NIC and other dedicated laboratories were able to characterize the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) influenza viruses during the 2007/2008 season and during the pandemic [11, 12] . Finally, as part of a routine pathogen surveillance program, a number of medical microbiology laboratories throughout the country report the weekly number of positive laboratory results for influenza virus and other respiratory viruses.\n"," Staff of the RIVM/CIb actively participated in several meetings that were organized by ECDC in the years before the 2009 pandemic. This included discussions on a range of options for\"surveillance in a pandemic. \" While some countries favored alternative surveillance instruments, for example, based on telephone consultations, The Netherlands decided to rely on the existing GP and nursing home sentinel surveillance systems.\n"," During a pandemic, testing requests could be expected to increase sharply, both owing to the large number of expected influenza patients and the increased need to exclude influenza among people who could be infected [4] . To ensure sufficient laboratory capacity would be available, the RIVM with local laboratories developed a method to ensure rapid scaling up, using standardized protocols [13] .\n"," A generic research proposal to study transmission risks following the introduction of a new influenza virus was prepared and received ethical approval in 2006. This facilitated combined epidemiological, clinical, veterinarian, virological, immunological, and perception research among cases and controls during the 2009 pandemic [12, 14, 15, 16] . The proposal included a\"first few hundreds\" approach, and enabled the conduct of a serosurvey among a random subsample of the population before and after the pandemic [17] .\n"," Analysis of previous pandemics and mathematical modeling studies had shown that once a new transmissible influenza virus would start to circulate locally among humans it could be contained if immediate stringent control measures were taken, but that once it started spreading, it would be only a matter of time before it would be a global problem. So unless a pandemic started in The Netherlands, whereby an attempt at containment could be made [18] , control efforts should be focused on mitigating the impact on society at large and the health sector in particular, and on protecting those at risk for severe outcomes. Modeling studies had shown that therapeutic use of antivirals could reduce transmission, while also reducing the risks for those infected [2, 19, 20] , thus the Ministry of Health had purchased 5 million courses of oseltamivir in bulk in 2006, which was all repacked in individual sachets. This should cover the 30% of the population estimated to develop a symptomatic infection during a pandemic. Furthermore, the ministry started negotiations with vaccine producers to ensure rapid delivery of 34 million doses of the pandemic vaccine once available; two doses for every Dutch citizen, based on the assumption that two doses would be needed to achieve sufficient protection against a novel influenza virus.\n"," After the first introduction of the virus in The Netherlands on 27 April 2009 from a child returning from Mexico, the number of imported cases gradually increased, but no sustained widespread community transmission occurred until October 2009 [26] . This early pandemic period was characterized by rapidly evolving insights in risks and management, based on incoming national and international data.\n"," Following the announcement of the WHO of an impending pandemic in late April 2009, the existing protocols for incidental introduction were made operational, with the aim of preventing transmission. Surveillance was strengthened by making confirmed influenza A(H1N1) pdm infection notifiable. Diagnostic capacity was strengthened by sharing standardized protocols for virological testing [13] . Initially, diagnostics was only performed at RIVM and Erasmus Medical Center; in parallel because the available tests were not yet sufficiently validated for the new virus. During this phase, about ten regional laboratories were validating their assays and when the virus was introduced in The Netherlands and the diagnostic capacity needed to be extended, these ten laboratories were able to take over the diagnostics from the RIVM and Erasmus Medical Center.\n"," A response team was formed at the RIVM/CIb that met daily (later twice weekly) to discuss the latest developments. Conclusions of the response team were discussed with the ministry on a daily basis through videoconference. Several OMT meetings were convened, where advice for the Ministry of Health was formulated on appropriate control interventions, such as social distancing, closing\n"," Bundesgesundheitsbl 2013 · 56:67-75 DOI 10.1007/s00103-012-1582-4 © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012\n"," Abstract Prior to 2009, The Netherlands had prepared itself extensively for a potential pandemic. Multidisciplinary guidelines had been drafted to control transmission and limit adverse outcomes for both a phase of early incidental introduction and for a phase with widespread transmission. The Ministry of Health had ensured a supply and distribution schedule for antivirals and negotiated a contract for vaccine purchases. During the pandemic, existing surveillance was expanded, the established infectious disease response structure was activated, and the previously prepared protocols for communication, diagnostics, use of antivirals, and vaccination implementation were operationalized and implemented.\n"," When the pandemic turned out to be less severe than many had anticipated, risk communication and rapid modification of guidelines and communication became a major challenge. Antivirals and pandemic vaccines were reserved for those at high risk for severe outcomes only. Overall, the impact of the pandemic was comparable to the impact of an average seasonal influenza epidemic, but with a shift in (severe) outcomes from the very young and elderly toward young adults. Established prepared protocols enabled timely coordinated responses. In preparing for the worst, sufficient attention must be given to preparing for a mild scenario as well. \n"," Influenzapandemie 2009 · Impfung · Niederlande · Vorbereitung · Kontrolle borders, use of masks, use of antivirals. Information for the public and for professionals was made available via the RIVM website, updated on a weekly basis. The RIVM/CIb provided information to public health professionals directly by a bidirectional communication tool distributed by e-mail (Inf@ct). The preparedness and response unit of the RIVM/CIb routinely has a 24/7 availability rooster to assist public health professionals, which proved to be very valuable during these early days as well.\n"," In June, the ministry decided to order 34 million doses of pandemic vaccine.\n"," In spite of all preparations, and the rapid designation of pandemic influenza as a notifiable disease, considerable effort was needed to have an operational case register, combining in a systematic way all relevant data for individual case management, control, surveillance, and outbreak investigations [21] . In particular, the different needs of those providing data inputs, and general privacy concerns, needed to be dealt with during a hectic period. Also, the amount of resources needed to identify and follow up all (suspected) patients and their contacts threatened to stretch the capacity and support of the PHSs to the limit. Therefore, the workload for the public health sector in the early days of the pandemic was very high, raising concerns about the ability to maintain such intensive efforts over a prolonged period of time, particularly because it was unknown at that moment if the worst was still to come.\n"," Furthermore, the lack of a surveillance of severe outcomes was felt as a major weakness, and therefore over the summer, a weekly surveillance system among pediatric ICUs was set up as the most feasible method to bridge this gap during an ongoing outbreak. Collaboration with Statistics Netherlands ensured that weekly data on all-cause mortality by age, sex, and region were sent to the RIVM/CIb to allow real-time monitoring of mortality trends.\n"," Early control efforts included a social distancing approach toward the first cases and their contacts, as well as providing leaflets to travelers arriving by plane from endemic areas asking them to report fever if it developed [22] . Modeling had shown that closure of borders was unlikely to be an efficient way to delay introduction [23] . The PHSs visited each of these cases; nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were taken. Confirmed cases and contacts were offered antivirals (oseltamivir) and patients were requested to stay at home for 10 days from the start of onset. Detailed household studies provided important data on transmission parameters such as R 0 and generation intervals, which were used to update existing transmission models already developed to guide and support control [24] . Cases and their contacts were furthermore requested to participate in the prepared influenza research protocol. With the increase in individual cases and with the accumulating data that the pandemic virus generally caused mild disease, comparable to seasonal influenza, support for this delay policy through social distancing and reduction of transmission declined. The epidemiology data of the early phase were published both nationally and internationally ( [25, 26] , . Fig. 1 ).\n"," On 22 June, the OMT advised that there was no longer a rationale to continue this intensive containment approach, in view of ongoing introductions and subsequent transmission, the mild character of most infections so far, the excessive burden this was placing on the PHSs, and the limited adherence. On 15 August 2009, the official notification requirements were modified, in that only hospitalizations and deaths with laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza needed to be notified.\n"," The OMT had requested a group of clinical experts to prepare guidelines on the clinical indications for use of antivirals; these guidelines in essence restricted use of antivirals to those with increased risk for adverse outcomes once infected, in line with the recognized risk groups for vaccination [27] . This meant that existing guidelines had to be adapted. Finally, the RIVM/CIb set up a working group with intensive care physicians to estimate available capacity and prepare contingency plans if needed.\n"," By the time schools reopened after the summer holidays in The Netherlands, between mid-August and early September, the evidence for a modest clinical impact was increasing. Transmission and clinical impact remained at low levels until over a month after reopening of the schools; there had been no spring or summer wave in The Netherlands. Due to the cessation of the notification, and the inability to track the epidemic progression in the regular GP surveillance owing to its low intensity, the number of reported hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths was the most informative real-time data source, recognizing that this created a bias toward monitoring severe outcomes. To adjust for delay in notifications, modeling experience was used to enable nowcasting of the epidemic [28] . Temporary school closure as a method to delay and reduce the peak incidence had been a control option considered in the preparation for an epidemic phase [29, 30] . The general mild character of the pandemic versus the potentially considerable societal and economic fall-out of temporary school closures made this strategy no longer proportional. Although some individual schools did close (in part or in full) when faced with a large degree of flu absenteeism, overall this remained a rare event.\n"," Nevertheless, anxiety among healthcare professionals in particular remained high. In spite of the lifting of the policy to delay epidemic introduction, PHSs remained extremely busy, and it was therefore decided to postpone the introduction of the annual national HPV campaign for 12-year-old girls, as this would have stretched the PHSs even further and might also jeopardize uptake in the pandemic vaccination campaigns. Furthermore, pediatricians were worried of being overwhelmed with ill babies and young children in the hospitals. Among the general public, there was on the one hand a feeling that the threat was overestimated, but on the other hand there was also still fear of an unpredictable severe course, in particular when the death of previously healthy children in the beginning of the epidemic was picked up by the media and widely publicized. Trust in government communication was in general high, but declined during the course of the pandemic [31] .\n"," The epidemic actually took off in the first week of October (week 41), when the ILI epidemic threshold in the sentinel surveillance was surpassed (>5.1 ILI Weekly surveillance updates were provided on the RIVM website starting in June (. Fig. 1) , accompanied by weekly wellattended press conferences beginning in August whereby the director of the CIb would give a brief update and answer press questions. Specific themes were highlighted during each week, e.g., vaccination, side effects, etc..\n"," The pandemic season lasted for 10 weeks and included the autumn midterm school breaks: week 43 for the northern and central part of The Netherlands and week 44 for the southern part. The epidemic peaked in week 45; in week 1 of 2010, the last regular pandemic surveillance update was published. An overall overview based on notified patients was published in Eurosurveillance [32] . A pre-and postpandemic population-based serologic survey showed that the overall attack rate was low (7.6%) in the general population, but high (35%) in 5-19-year-olds. Hospitalization and mortality rates per infection increased significantly with age [17] . Overall mortality was comparable to seasonal epidemics, but a clear shift in mortality toward younger age groups was found [33, 34] . Use of antivirals among nonhospitalized patients with an indication for use remained low (Hooij veld et al., manuscript submitted). Viral resistance monitoring continued, and in spite of the detection of several resistant viruses, no sustained transmission occurred [12] . Notification of hospitalized and deceased patients continued until after the 2010-2011 season [33] .\n"," Overall, the high infection attack rate in children and very low attack rate in older adults, together with the low severity of illness per infection in children but substantial severity in older adults, produced an epidemic with a low overall impact and a comparable burden of disease to seasonal epidemics ( [35, 36, 37] , . Fig. 2, 3 ).\n"," In The Netherlands, childhood vaccinations included in the Dutch National Immunization Programe are delivered by PHSs free of charge to the recipients. Children or their parents are invited once a vaccination is due. This results in a high overall uptake. Seasonal influenza vacci- nation for high-risk groups, including the elderly, is delivered by GPs and by nursing homes, also free of charge for the eligible groups.\n"," Prior to the pandemic, the Dutch Health Council had discussed which groups should be vaccinated first in case availability of vaccines would be lower than needed. Priority should be given to those at highest risk for severe outcomes, followed by healthcare workers. When over the summer of 2009 more and more data became available that in general the infection did not lead to severe outcome, the Health Council advised in August that for pandemic vaccination the same risk groups as for seasonal vaccination should be targeted (i.e., people with underlying conditions, people 60 years of age and above, and healthcare professionals) with the addition of pregnant women, as these were the groups considered at highest risk of severe adverse outcomes. Thereby, vaccination was primarily intended to reduce severe morbidity and mortality, not to interrupt transmission. Although data on the effectiveness of a single dose of vaccination in healthy adults became available, the Health Council advised to maintain a two-dose schedule, as they considered there were insufficient data available to assess effectiveness for the risk groups targeted in The Netherlands (not healthy adults), and no shortage was foreseen.\n"," Pandemic vaccination for these risk groups was implemented by the GPs, as this is a successful and tested strategy for seasonal vaccination of risk groups. GPs receive a financial compensation for each vaccinated person, and influenza vaccination is free of charge for those with a recommendation to receive the vaccine [as is the case for all (targeted) vaccinations provided by the government]. Overall, seasonal influenza vaccination uptake for medical risk groups below the age of 65 years is around 70% and for the elderly over 80% [6] . Monitoring of uptake in these groups was as always done via GP registers. Vaccination of healthcare professionals is organized by the health sector. Seasonal uptake in this group is hard to assess, but in general estimated to be around 20% for nursing home staff [38] and over 50% for GPs [39] . Vaccination uptake in pregnant women, a new target group, was hardest to assess, as no routine structure was available. Therefore, this was assessed via retrospective questionnaires among pregnant women [40] .\n"," Making use of these existing structures, pandemic vaccination was rolled out as soon as vaccines were available. Seasonal vaccination had gone ahead as scheduled for healthcare staff, the elderly, and medical risk groups in October, followed by the start of pandemic vaccination early November with Pandemrix® for these same groups, plus pregnant wom-en and for healthcare professionals, with a second dose offered after 2 weeks.\n"," In early November 2009, concern about potential overburdening of the health services by sick young children, in particular children too young to be treated with antivirals, led to an additional recommendation to vaccinate all children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, as well as the caretakers of babies between 0 and 6 months. Vaccinations of children in The Netherlands are routinely provided through the PHS. Apart from the routine infant and child vaccinations, protocols existed for mass vaccination campaigns, and had been used and tested for a meningitis B vaccination campaign in 2003 [41] . Mass vaccination of children with Focetria® was started in late November, with the second dose offered 2 weeks later in the beginning of December.\n"," This approach meant that the implementation of a pandemic vaccination strategy could build on established and tested practices, including trust between the people invited and the people inviting. Thus, in spite of ongoing discussions in the media regarding the need for pandemic vaccination (\"mild epidemic\"), concerns about limited data on long-term safety of adjuvanted novel vaccines, and extensive media attention for potential conflict of interests between pharmacy and government advisors, the overall uptake of pandemic vaccination was good, comparable to uptake of seasonal vaccination for those eligible ( [40, 42, 43] , . Tab. 1, 2). Comparable to the situation with seasonal vaccination, uptake among healthcare workers was the main challenge. Employers are responsible to order and distribute the vaccines. For institutions with no prior experience in annual seasonal vaccination campaigns, this was a major challenge. A helpdesk for the ordering and logistic issues was established at the RIVM, as the RIVM was responsible for the logistics of the vaccination distributions.\n"," Uptake of the second dose was between 80 and 90% of the first dose in the different target groups (. Tab. 1, 2) . Overall, an estimated one third of the population (5 million people) was vaccinated.\n"," In view of the use of a novel vaccine, intensified monitoring for side effects was conducted by the RIVM/CIb togeth- \n"," Extensive evaluations have been conducted by many involved parties in The Netherlands, aided by a detailed chronological overview of events [46] . The longterm multidisciplinary preparation for a pandemic, as well as the strong structure established for control and communication, proved crucial for a coordinated response. Guidelines, surveillance, mathematical modeling could all build on each other's contributions and strengths. This is despite the fact that a (severe) pandemic caused by an avian influenza virus originating from Asia was anticipated, rather than a (relatively mild) swine-origin virus from Mexico.\n"," Nevertheless, how to communicate that preparing for the worst does not imply that the worst will happen remained a challenge. Sufficient attention in preparing for mild scenarios too might save resources, facilitate risk communication, optimize the effectiveness of control, and increase trust in authorities.\n"," Also, even with many guidelines in place, a great amount of effort was required to assess the continuous flow of more and more new data both in the scientific and in the lay press about the impact of the pandemic on individuals and on the population level, and about the effectiveness of interventions. Such data had to be evaluated for their scientific merit, assessed against available local data as well as their relevance to the specific Dutch situation. Estimations of impact based on modeled assumptions had to be updated rapidly as new data became available. On the one hand, maximum flexibility was needed to modify guidelines and procedures where indicated [47] , on the other hand, continuity in control and communication was essential as well.\n"," Furthermore, in spite of numerous exercises and a stand-by multisectoral database, a significant amount of effort was needed to collect and analyze all incoming data from clinicians, laboratories, and public health officials in a standardized and structured way, which put stress on (internal) communications and reduced the potential for rapid outbreak investigations [21] .\n"," Surveillance benefited from well-established routines and longitudinal data. Setting up SARI surveillance during the pandemic was only feasible because of the strong commitment of a well-identified group of pediatric ICUs; work is still ongoing to try and make this a part of routine surveillance.\n"," In a crisis such as a pandemic, good generic preparation is essential, as this enables building on established practices and trust. However, the continuous media attention and shifting public opinions, along with rapidly accumulating scientific data, necessitates maximum flexibility so as to maintain effective and credible management. \n","Score: 6.906671570932102\n","\n","Title: Disease burden and clinical severity of the first pandemic wave of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China\n","Body Text: A s of 26 July 2020, 188 countries have been affected by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 , with 15,745,102 COVID-19 cases and 644,661 deaths reported worldwide 1 . COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of severity. Of serological-confirmed infections, only a fraction will develop symptoms. A fraction of symptomatic cases may seek medical care, when they can be identified via surveillance systems, require hospitalization, and die. Hospitalization is an important metric as it determines the strain exerted by an epidemic on the health care system. Further, deaths are highly relevant to planning pandemic responses, as mortality is an outcome that health authorities typically aim to minimize (Fig. 1a) .\n"," Estimates of disease burden and clinical severity of COVID-19 are critical to identify appropriate intervention strategies, plan for healthcare needs, and ensure the sustainability of the health system throughout the duration of the pandemic. However, quantifying these estimates based on surveillance data is challenging due to changes in health seeking behaviors during the pandemic, as well as underdiagnoses of a novel pathogen.\n"," Historically, two influenza pandemics had far-reaching influences to humankind worldwide: the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics 2 . The 1918 influenza pandemic is typically considered as the worst-case pandemic scenario for pandemic planning. In contrast, the 2009 influenza pandemic is considered mild but provides a benchmark for a pandemic in modern times, as the health systems, supportive care, and populations, are comparable with those of today. Comparing the COVID-19 burden and clinical severity with past influenza pandemics can help public health officials interpret the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of the response efforts. A further comparison between the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal influenza can be useful to optimize health resource allocations, considering their overlapping circulation periods.\n"," Wuhan is a particularly well-suited location to assess the health burden of COVID-19. Firstly, Wuhan experienced intense community transmissions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); secondly, the first wave has ended, with only seven sporadic cases reported between March 24 and May 18 3 . Therefore, the first epidemic wave in Wuhan (for the period December 1, 2019-March 31, 2020) is an opportunity to comprehensively quantify the disease burden and clinical severity of COVID-19. Here, we used multiple data sources to estimate age-specific rates of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, medically attended cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, accounting for health seeking behaviors and underdiagnoses. We also estimated rates of medically attended influenza-like-illness (ILI) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections; hospitalizations with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), and pneumonia hospitalizations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections by dividing the number of ILI consultations, SARI hospitalizations and pneumonia hospitalizations by the number of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Moreover, we estimated the clinical severity of COVID-19 including the symptomatic case-fatality risk (sCFR), medically attended case-fatality risk (mCFR), hospitalizationfatality risk (HFR), symptomatic case-hospitalization risk (sCHR), and medically attended case-hospitalization risk (mCHR). The rates of symptomatic cases, medically attended cases, hospitalizations, and deaths with SARS-CoV-2 were calculated by dividing the number of cases at each level of severity by population size. Clinical severity was obtained by dividing the numbers of cases in the corresponding severity pyramid (Fig. 1a) . Finally, we compared our estimates with those of the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics, and with seasonal influenza.\n"," Reported COVID-19 cases. We obtained the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and clinically-diagnosed cases in Wuhan from published literatures and the Hubei Health Commission 3, 4 . Cases were mainly confirmed by realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and included mild, moderate, severe, and critical cases [5] [6] [7] [8] . Mild cases refer to cases with mild symptoms and no radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Moderate cases refer to cases with fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Severe cases refer to cases with any breathing problems, finger oxygen saturation, and low PaO 2 /FiO 2 (PaO 2 denotes partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood; FiO 2 denotes fraction of inspired oxygen), etc. Critical cases refer to cases having any respiratory failures, shock, and any other organ failures that requires ICU admission. Clinicallydiagnosed cases included suspected cases with pneumonia as indicated by chest radiography, but without virological confirmation of infection 6 . (Supplementary Information File 1) These clinically-diagnosed cases were included in our study, recognizing the value of a clinical definition at the peak of a pandemic and in the context of limited laboratory testing capacity. A total of 50,333 COVID-19 cases were reported in the 4-month epidemic in Wuhan. Of them, 32,968 (65.5%) were laboratory-confirmed cases. As of July 20, 3869 cases have died, and all others recovered. These cases were recorded from passive surveillance which was launched at the start of the outbreak in late December 2019 in Wuhan 9 , and from active door-todoor and individual-to-individual screenings for fever (Supplementary Information File 2) 10, 11 .\n"," Estimated disease burden of COVID-19. RT-PCR sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection varied based on the interval between symptom onset and laboratory testing, which was highest (97.9%) at an interval of <7 days 12 . A population-based telephone and online survey conducted in Wuhan found that 35.4% (95% CI 28.4-43.9%) of patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) (i.e., fever with any symptoms of cough, and/or sore throat) sought medical care during the epidemic of COVID-19 13 . All cases from passive surveillance were considered as medically attended cases. In the baseline analysis, we assumed that a proportion of mild cases, and all moderate-to-critical cases (had radiographic evidence of pneumonia) captured by active screenings in the community would eventually seek medical care given that the health system was not overwhelmed. It was assumed that the cases from passive surveillance had the same health seeking behavior as those captured by active screenings in the community. Laboratory-confirmed cases (moderate-to-critical) and clinically-diagnosed cases had radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and thus were considered as requiring hospitalizations (Fig. 1b) .\n"," After adjusting for sensitivity of RT-PCR testing, and accounting for the probability of seeking medical care and prospective screenings in the community, we estimated that a total of 52,300 (95% CI 50,500-54,500) medically-attended cases and 39,600 (95% CI 38,300-41,100) hospitalizations were associated with COVID- 19 Mortality rates 1) Hospitalization rates 1) In the baseline analysis, it was assumed that a proportion of mild cases, and all moderate-to-critical cases captured by universal screenings in the community would eventually seek medical care given that the health system was not overwhelmed. And it was assumed that the cases from surveillance system had the same health seeking behavior as them; 10, 11 . P se : RT-PCR sensitivity 12 .

Estimated clinical severity of COVID-19. The overall sCFR of COVID-19 was 4.54% (95% CI 3.70-5.14%), which is comparable, if not higher, to that of the 1918 influenza pandemic-from the analysis of data from eight US localities, the sCFR was estimated at 1.61% and 1.98% for the first and second wave, respectively 23, 24 . Such a figure is substantially higher than that of the 2009 influenza pandemic (<0.1% in the US) 25 . The sCFR of COVID-19 was higher for adults aged ≥60 years than for the other age groups (9.09% vs. 0.36-1.97%). (Fig. 5a- Sensitivity analyses. To assess the robustness of our findings, we conducted four sensitivity analyses: In scenario (i) we assumed that moderate cases had the same health seeking behavior as mild cases, i.e., only a proportion of moderate cases sought medical assistance, in scenario (ii) we excluded clinically-diagnosed cases, in scenario (iii) we used the upper limit of 95% CI of the probability of seeking medical care, and in scenario (iv) we used the lower limit of 95% CI of the probability of seeking medical care. Compared to the baseline analysis, the mean rates of symptomatic cases for COVID-19 increased from 796 to 935 per 100,000 persons in scenario (i), and 960 per 100,000 persons in scenario (iv), while rates decreased to 634 per 100,000 persons in scenario (ii), and 719 per 100,000 persons in scenario (iii). The sCFR decreased from 4.54 to 3.87% in scenario (i) and 3.77% in scenario (iv), while it increased to 5.38% in scenario (ii) and 5.03% in scenario (iii). Similar patterns were observed for the other metrics of interests ( Supplementary Information File 3) . Overall, the estimated variations did not change our findings, particularly for comparison of COVID-19 with influenza pandemics and seasonal influenza.\n"," ILI consultations and SARI/pneumonia hospitalizations. We quantitatively assessed the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare sector using the local number of ILI consultations, and SARI/ pneumonia hospitalizations in the absence of COVID-19 as a reference. The rate of medically attended COVID-19 was approximately 1.3 times the baseline ILI consultations among adults of ≥60 years of age. The hospitalization rate of COVID-19 was 3-6-fold higher than baseline SARI hospitalizations among adults of ≥20 years of age, and 25-132 fold higher than pneumonia hospitalizations as a reference (Supplementary Information File 6).\n"," This study used multiple sources of data to estimate different levels of the COVID-19 severity pyramid. We found that the mean rates of symptomatic cases, medical consultations, hospitalizations and deaths were respectively 796, 489, 370, and 36.2 per 100,000 persons in Wuhan from December 2019 to March 2020. All burden metrics increased with age, with adults ≥60 years of age most affected. Similarly, the highest sCFR and HFR were found in older adults.\n"," Our study was strengthened by adjustment for several potential biases. First, rates of medical consultations were adjusted by the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays 12 . Sensitivity was only 30-40% before January 23 due to delayed detection, which could lead to important underdiagnoses and has not been considered in previous studies. Second, we accounted for the health seeking behaviors among the Wuhan population during the epidemic 13 . The probability of seeking medical treatment conditionally on symptoms of acute respiratory diseases is a critical parameter to estimate the true number of COVID-19 cases in community. Accordingly, our estimates of disease burden may be the most accurate for Wuhan so far.\n"," Two studies reported on COVID-19 disease burden in the US and Canada by the end of May, at which time local epidemics are still ongoing ( Supplementary Information File 7) 27, 28 . The overall rate of symptomatic cases (796 vs. 404-534 per 100,000 persons) in Wuhan was much higher than that in the US and Québec, a severely affected province of Canada. Variation in testing strategies likely contribute to the difference in rate of symptomatic cases, in addition to true difference in epidemic dynamics. Unlike in Wuhan, only individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and asymptomatic individuals with suspected exposure were preferentially tested in the US. Moreover, in contrast to our study, the US and Canadian estimates were not adjusted for the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays and health seeking behaviors, and thus may be underestimated. Our estimated hospitalization rate for a 4-month COVID-19 outbreak was much higher than that for a 3-6-month COVID-19 outbreak in the US and Québec (370 vs. 50-114 per 100,000 persons) [27] [28] [29] [30] . We estimated that 76% of medically-attended cases were hospitalized in Wuhan, while only 18% were hospitalized in the US 30 . The difference between these estimates could be explained by the potential different clinical thresholds for hospitalization. We assumed that moderately ill cases with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and more severe cases would be hospitalized in the context of medical practices in China, based on the probability of progression from disease to death 31 . However, such results may not apply to other countries with different healthcare practice and general health seeking behaviors. For example, Chinese patients are less likely to seek care at primary health institutions than hospitals 32 .\n"," The mortality rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan was lower than the excess mortality in New York City (24,172 excess deaths 33 among 19,746,286 individuals, and thus 122 per 100,000 individuals), and Québec (52 per 100,000 persons) 28 , but similar to the national excess all-cause mortality in the US (122,300 excess deaths among 332,382,720 individuals, and thus 36.8 per 100,000 individuals) 34 . In our study, patients who died at home or died before being diagnosed were not considered, which could have been important in the early phase of the epidemic due to underascertainment. A recent comprehensive correction of official tallies of cases and deaths by the Wuhan Authorities, included in this study, could minimize this under-ascertainment. Further research should use excess mortality approaches 33 to capture the full burden of the outbreak, when vital registration data for this period become available.\n"," Our estimates of sCFR (4.54% vs. 1.2-1.4%) and mCFR (7.40% vs. 5.91%) for Wuhan were higher than in prior modeling studies 35, 36 . This was likely explained by the addition of revised statistics on cases and deaths, and a more complete dataset with no right-censored outcomes in our study. Large variations in mCFR were observed between countries, which have not been systematically analyzed. Qualitatively, these variations could be explained by differences in the sensitivity of surveillance systems to detect cases at different levels of the severity pyramid, differences in clinical care of severe and critical patients, and in age structure and underlying conditions of the population.\n"," Our HFR estimate (9.77%) was higher than the estimate obtained by Wang et al. in a highly censored sample in Wuhan in the very early stages of the epidemic (4.3%) 37 . However, it was much lower than the 28% estimate obtained in two COVID-19designated hospitals for severe COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, probably due to the particularly high proportion of severe and critical patients hospitalized in these facilities (64% vs. 28%) 38 . Our HFR estimate was lower than the 18.1% estimate in France 39 , probably due to aforementioned loose threshold for hospital admissions in China and preference of seeking care in hospitals rather than outpatient settings.\n"," We systematically compared the burden of the COVID-19 outbreak with that of the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics and seasonal influenza. Our COVID-19 estimates were substantially higher than those of the 2009 influenza pandemic and seasonal influenza, and similar to the 1918 influenza pandemic. However, the age pattern of severe disease was clearly different. Our COVID-19 severity estimates increased with age. In contrast, younger age groups were the most affected by 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemic, and both youngest and oldest individuals were the most affected by seasonal influenza. Small changes were observed when we adjusted the overall burden and clinical severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza using Wuhan age profile as a reference ( Supplementary Information Files 5 and 8) . Comparison of severity estimates between pandemics was difficult to standardize, particularly for 1918 influenza pandemic 23 . The 1918 sCFR was based on data from a single US study from more than a 100 years ago, at a time when awareness of viral diseases was inexistent, case ascertainment and disease surveillance were limited, and definition of clinical outcomes varied. Therefore, our comparison was not intended to quantify the absolute value of differences, but to put the COVID-19 pandemic into perspective.\n"," To put our results in perspective, it is important to stress that our COVID-19 estimates refer to the first epidemic wave in Wuhan-a 4-month long period. The epidemic was controlled by intense interventions 4 . If the epidemic rebounds, as one would expect if the infection was reintroduced in a population with low immunity, the disease burden would rise. Moreover, given that the epidemic lasted only 4 months, the stress on the healthcare system was tremendous, as severe cases and hospitalizations were concentrated over a relatively short period of time. Furthermore, neither seasonal nor pandemic influenza outbreaks were controlled, as vaccination was either low or delayed until after the main wave had passed, and no social distancing was put in place.\n"," Using a simple data-driven approach, we quantitatively assessed the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare sector using the local number of ILI consultations, and SARI/pneumonia hospitalizations in the absence of COVID-19 as a reference. The number of COVID-19 hospitalizations was several folds higher than that of baseline SARI hospitalizations and 25-132 folds higher than that of pneumonia hospitalizations among adults (≥20 years of age). This indicates that during this time period, the Wuhan healthcare system considerably exceeded surge capacity, highlighting the importance and necessity of preparedness for sufficient healthcare resources. Moreover, there is a winter peak of consultations and hospitalizations related to respiratory diseases, such as seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus 14, 40, 41 , which may have contributed to overwhelm the healthcare sector during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic.\n"," Our study has some limitations. First, health-seeking behavior may have not remained constant throughout the epidemic. In this survey, study participants in Wuhan were asked to review their history of ARI between December 2019 and March 2020, and whether they sought medical assistance for these symptoms 13 . However, since we did not obtain the onset date of these symptoms, and hence we could not stratify health-seeking behavior by COVID-19 epidemic phase. Instead, we calculated the overall proportion of ARIs cases who sought medical care during the epidemic. If the distribution of onset dates of ARIs cases in our sample was skewed towards the early phase (late January) of the epidemic, the proportion seeking medical care may be underestimated due to the overwhelmed health system. That would lead to an overestimation of the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Conversely, if the distribution of onset dates was skewed towards the late phases of epidemic, we may have underestimated the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the probability of seeking medical care, using the lower and upper limits of the 95% CI of our survey. This analysis resulted in minor changes in the disease burden and clinical severity estimates compared to the baseline analysis.\n"," Second, missing or incorrect records of COVID-19 cases are inevitable during an outbreak, particularly in the period when the healthcare capacity is overwhelmed. A verification of reported COVID-19 cases was conducted by Wuhan Authorities to correct for late reporting, omissions, and misreporting, with 325 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1290 deaths added to official tallies. Due to the high specificity of RT-PCR assay (almost 100%), false positives were rare [42] [43] [44] [45] . We included in the analysis clinically-diagnosed cases that were reported for a brief 1-week period, when testing could not keep up, so we inevitably overestimated the true number of COVID-19 cases. Our sensitivity analyses showed that the exclusion of these clinically-diagnosed cases led to decreased estimates of disease burden and increased estimates of clinical severity. However, our conclusions were robust to these changes. Moreover, while reporting of cases changed at the beginning of the pandemic as the definition of COVID-19 suspected cases broadened to include a milder spectrum, we expected reporting was relatively stable throughout the rest of the outbreak although this would be difficult to prove conclusively.\n"," Additionally, it is difficult to extrapolate our findings to other countries/regions since estimates of clinical severity and disease burden of COVID-19 are influenced by multiple factors such as the evolution of the epidemic, intervention policies, case detection strategy, surge capacity of healthcare systems, differences in presentation, triage, and treatment, and health seeking behaviors over time and across locations. A modelling study has revealed that containment has proved to be successful to control the local COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan. Without containment efforts, the number of COVID-19 cases would have been an estimated 67fold higher than that has been thus far 46 . Therefore, our estimates in Wuhan could represent the disease burden and clinical severity in a region with (1) wide-spread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2; (2) strict nonpharmaceutical interventions, referred as to \"wartime measures\" in the study by Leung et al. 47 ; (3) extensive detection of all outpatients with fever 10 ; (4) enhanced healthcare capacity. Indeed, Wuhan experienced remarkably rapid and extensive support from top-level medical staff drawn from all over China, as well as rapid establishment of medical facilities like the Leishenshan and Fangcang shelter hospitals [48] [49] [50] . Although the COVID-19 pandemic has already spread across the world, and the scale of epidemics in western countries, like the US and Brazil, exceeded that in Wuhan by far, the pandemic in other countries is still ongoing and any estimate is bound to be revised. Our estimates represent the full impact of a short but intense first wave, and could be considered as benchmarks to plan intervention strategies for a potential second wave of the pandemic.\n"," In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China (December 2019-March 2020), intense community transmissions caused higher disease burden than the 2009 influenza pandemic and seasonal influenza. Overall, we find that the clinical severity of COVID-19 seems to be in the same order of magnitude as that of the 1918 influenza pandemic. In contrast to the age pattern of influenza virus infection, however, the highest burden and clinical severity of COVID-19 is observed among older adults, while children are less affected. During the epidemic of COVID-19, the Wuhan healthcare system considerably exceeded surge capacity. This study is helpful to guide intervention strategies and healthcare preparedness for the potential re-emergence of COVID-19 in China and beyond.\n"," Case definitions. Case definitions for laboratory-confirmed-cases were issued by the National Health Commission of China, and included mild, moderate, severe, and critical cases. Cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or by viral sequencing indicating genomes highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 [5] [6] [7] [8] . Clinically-diagnosed cases included suspected cases with pneumonia as indicated by chest radiography, but without virological confirmation of infections 6 . The \"clinical\" definition was only used for 1 week in Hubei province as laboratory testing capacity was insufficient, and led to a large number of clinical cases to be isolated and treated without delay. These clinicallydiagnosed cases were included in our study, recognizing the value of a clinical definition at the peak of a pandemic and in the context of limited laboratory testing capacity. The laboratory-confirmed cases include mild-to-critical cases, while the clinically-diagnosed cases include moderate-to-critical cases. Definitions are presented in detail in Supplementary Information File 1.\n"," Data source COVID-19 cases. Our study aimed to account for underdiagnosis associated with the sensitivity of laboratory assays, which is strongly dependent on the time lag between symptom onset and diagnostic test 12 . The distribution of lags varied at different phases of the epidemic in Wuhan due to laboratory testing capacity 4 . Accordingly, the daily number of COVID-19 cases by symptom onset date was preferred to the aggregated cumulative data.\n"," We obtained the following data: the daily number of laboratory-confirmed cases based on date of symptom onset in Wuhan extracted from a study which included 32,583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as of March 8 (D1), and 17,365 clinically-diagnosed COVID-19 cases during February 9-19 (D2) 4 . The daily number of laboratory-confirmed cases in Wuhan based on reporting date on March 9-April 3 were extracted from the Hubei Health Commission (D3) 3 . The total number of COVID-19 deaths in Wuhan as of April 24 was obtained from the Hubei Health Commission (D4) 3 . To correct the late reporting, omissions and misreporting of COVID-19 cases due to the healthcare capacity being overwhelmed during the outbreak, Wuhan Authorities conducted a comprehensive and systematic verification of reported COVID-19 cases between late March and middle April. A total of 325 laboratory-confirmed cases (D5) and 1290 deaths (D6) were added on April 17 3 . The number of COVID-19 cases stratified by age and clinical category was obtained from the above sources data D1 and D2, while the age profile of fatal cases was obtained from the China CDC Weekly report 4, 51 .\n"," All of these datasets were registered through a surveillance system, which was launched to record the information on COVID-19 cases in China at the start of the outbreak in late December 2019 in Wuhan 9 . These data were collected from passive surveillance, and active door-to-door and individual-to-individual screenings for fever. The active screening was implemented twice in Wuhan on a daily basis from January 24-February 10 to February 17-19 10, 11 . A total of 16,781 laboratoryconfirmed cases were identified through active screenings (D7, Details shown in Supplementary Information File 2) 10, 11 .\n"," Sensitivity of RT-PCR. A study retrospectively analyzed the RT-PCR assays of 301 patients with 1113 specimens in Wuhan, and found that RT-PCR sensitivity varied at different phases of the epidemic due to the difference of interval between symptom onset and laboratory testing (P se ) ( Supplementary Information File 9 ). The sensitivity of RT-PCR assays was highest (97.9%) at an interval of <7 days 12 .\n"," Health seeking behavior surveys. A population-based telephone and online survey was conducted to understand the health seeking behaviors of patients suffering from acute respiratory infections (i.e., fever with any symptoms of cough, and/or sore throat) during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Of patients with acute respiratory infections, 35.4% (95% CI 28.4-43.9%) sought medical care, by adjusting for the age structure of Wuhan population. Children had a higher probability of medical attendance than adults (P med.care ) 13, 52 .\n"," Other datasets. A total of 10.7 million persons lived in Wuhan during the epidemic 53 . The age profile of the Wuhan population was obtained from the China Statistic Yearbook 54 . To compare the burden of COVID-19 to baseline activity of acute respiratory infections, we obtained reference historical data on ILI surveillance in Hubei province and SARI surveillance in Jingzhou city, Hubei province 14, 17, 21 . Additionally, we collected the annual number of consultations in pediatric and internal medicine departments in Hubei, and the national number of pneumonia hospitalization rates from the Chinese Health Statistics Yearbook 55 . All these data were collected from publicly available sources and did not contain any personal identifiable information. Summary of data were presented in Supplementary Information File 10.\n"," Statistical analysis. Figure 1 described the metrics we estimated, data flow, data analysis procedure and assumptions in the baseline analyses. All analyses were performed in R version 3.6.3 56 .\n"," Reported COVID-19 cases in Wuhan. In the baseline analysis, we considered COVID-19 cases in Wuhan as those with laboratory-confirmation or with a clinical diagnosis (for the brief period where the clinical definition was in place) and tabulated data by symptom onset date. The interval between symptom onset and diagnosis was obtained from data D1 4 . Then, we randomly simulated 10,000 draws from a gamma distribution representing these time intervals to estimate onset dates for laboratory-confirmed cases reported between March 9 and April 3 (data D3), and added laboratory-confirmed cases (data D5). This allowed us to impute onset dates for cases that did not have this information.\n"," Medical consultations. All cases from passive surveillance were considered as medical attendance (data D1 + D3 + D5, and D2). In the baseline analysis, we assumed that a proportion of mild cases, and all moderate-to-critical cases captured by active screenings in the community (data D7) would eventually seek medical care given that the health system was not overwhelmed (Assumption 1). The health seeking behavior of mild cases was assumed to be the same as aforementioned patients with acute respiratory infections during the COVID-19 epidemic (P med.care ) 13 . Hence, to estimate medically attended cases, we only excluded a proportion of (1 − P med.care ) mild cases identified by community screening from the total reported COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the number of laboratory-confirmed cases from official reports (data D1 + D3 + D5, and D7) was divided by the sensitivity of RT-PCR (P se ) to account for underdiagnoses.\n"," Symptomatic cases. In the baseline analysis, we assumed the cases from surveillance system (data D1 + D3 + D5, and D2) had the same health seeking behavior as those captured by active screenings in the community (data D7) given that the health system was not overwhelmed (Assumption 1). Accordingly, the number of mild symptomatic cases was estimated by dividing reported mild COVID-19 cases by the probability of seeking medical care, conditionally on self-reported acute respiratory infection 13 . Adjustment of sensitivity of RT-PCR was considered as well.\n"," Hospitalized cases. Moderate-to-critical COVID-19 cases had radiographic evidence of pneumonia, while mild cases were defined as those without radiographic evidence of pneumonia [5] [6] [7] [8] . Chest x-ray confirmed pneumonia is a threshold for hospital admissions in China. Accordingly, in our study, estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related hospitalizations excluded patients defined as mild cases in the baseline analysis (Assumption 2).\n"," In above analyses, to account for the uncertainty of two parameters (RT-PCR sensitivity and probability of seeking medical care), we conducted a Monte Carlo Simulation by drawing 10,000 samples from Binomial distributions. We generated 10,000 estimates for the number of COVID-19 cases, based on which we calculated the median, and 95% CIs (the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) for the outcomes of interest in this study.\n"," Additionally, the following sensitivity analyses were conducted: in scenario (i) for above Assumptions 1 and 2, we assumed moderate cases had the same health seeking behavior as mild cases, i.e., only a proportion of moderate cases sought medical assistance (P med.care ); and in scenario (ii) we excluded clinicallydiagnosed cases.\n"," Disease burden. We used the number of ILI consultations, and the number of SARI/pneumonia hospitalizations in the absence of COVID-19 outbreak as a reference to estimate COVID-19 related ILI medical consultations, and COVID-19 associated SARI/pneumonia hospitalization rate. Estimation of the number of ILI cases and SARI/pneumonia hospitalizations during the periods were shown in Supplementary Information Files 11-14 .\n"," Moreover, for comparison with historical outbreaks, we conducted a narrative review on estimates of disease burden and clinical severity for the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics, as well as seasonal influenza in China and USA (Summary of studies shown in Supplementary Information Files 4, 5) . The age profile of COVID-19 cases was obtained from data D1 4 , in which COVID-19 cases were broken down into 20-year age categories. We could not generate disease burden and clinical severity estimates for influenza using the same age stratification, because numerators and denominators were not available from the literatures.\n"," Role of the funding source. The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n","Score: 6.735629701292526\n","\n","Title: Preventive behaviors, beliefs, and anxieties in relation to the swine flu outbreak among college students aged 18-24 years\n","Body Text: As of May 2010, 214 countries worldwide have reported laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 including 18,036 deaths. According to WHO, the case count was likely to be significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred as many countries stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness (WHO 2010) .\n"," In October 2009, nearly all states reported geographically widespread influenza activity. Nationwide, the percentage of visits to health care providers for influenza-like illness (ILI) was higher than that observed at the peak of any seasonal influenza season since ILINet (Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network) was implemented in its current form in 1997 (CDC 2010) . By April 2010 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated 12,470 deaths (CDC 2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g) .\n"," Since April 2009, pandemic H1N1 became the dominant circulating influenza strain (CDC 2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g) . According to CDC of the 48,483 (99.8%) specimens positive for influenza A, 32,867 (68%) were subtyped by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The result was 99.8% for 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) viruses, 18 (0.1%) were seasonal influenza A (H1), and 35 (0.1%) were influenza A (H3) viruses (CDC 2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g) . Due to the prevalence of H1N1 type strain, the CDC stopped widespread testing for the H1N1 influenza virus (CDC 2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g) . On 24 October 2009, the US government declared the swine flu outbreak a national emergency, thereby allowing hospital and local governments to speedily set up alternate sites for treatment and triage procedures if needed to handle any surge of patients (Calmes and McNeil 2009) .\n"," The information analyzed by the CDC supports the conclusion that novel H1N1 flu has caused greater disease burden on people younger than 25 years of age than older people (CDC 2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g) . One study done earlier in 2009 among US military beneficiaries about the epidemiologic characteristics of novel H1N1 clearly showed that the strain appeared to preferentially affect adolescent and young adults between 15 and 24 years of age (Crum-Cianflone et al. 2009 ). At the inception of the epidemic, there were no vaccines available. Later, there were vaccines available free of charge for H1N1 influenza, and the CDC recommended the vaccine as the best preventive measure against H1N1 (CDC 2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g) . Transmissibility of the H1N1 virus has been shown to be substantially higher than that of seasonal flu (Fraser et al. 2009 ). Thus, it has become imperative to educate the public about measures of prevention of transmission of the H1N1 virus in order to mitigate its impact on the population.\n"," Encouraging the public to undertake specific behaviors related to hygiene has proved useful in containing previous outbreaks of infectious diseases (Fung and Cairncross 2006) . Motivating the public to adopt such behaviors as well as sustaining them can become daunting challenges. Studies of how people responded to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 suggest that perceptions or beliefs about an outbreak may be important in determining compliance with official advice. Different authors have cited the Health Belief Model (Lau et al. 2003; Tang and Wong 2003; Janz and Becker 1984; Rosenstock et al. 1988; Tang and Wong 2004; Lau et al. 2007 ) and the public's response during the outbreak of SARS (Lau et al. 2003; Tang and Wong 2003; Tang and Wong 2004; Lau et al. 2007 ) to suggest that people may be more likely to comply with health-related recommendations if they believe the following: the effects of the disease are severe; the recommended behaviors are effective (Tang and Wong 2004; Lau et al. 2007; Janz and Becker 1984) ; they are susceptible (Janz and Becker 1984; Rosenstock et al. 1988; Tang and Wong 2004) ; the illness is difficult to treat (Lau et al. 2007 ); the government is providing clear and sufficient information about the outbreak and can be trusted to control the spread of infection (Tang and Wong 2003) ; and there are few barriers to action (Janz and Becker 1984; Rosenstock et al. 1988 ). In addition, a higher level of anxiety or worry may be associated with an increase in behavior changes (Leung et al. 2005) . Thus, understanding the role of specific perceptions in motivating people to engage in precautionary behavior may help health communicators improve their messages about outbreaks of new infectious disease generally and H1N1 specifically (Rubin et al. 2009 ).\n"," The four main objectives of this study were to determine (1) knowledge, beliefs, and misconception about the 2009 swine flu, (2) perception about the efficacy of swine flu immunization and governmental actions to contain the H1N1 epidemic, (3) perceived efficacy of preventive behavior, and (4) prevalence of anxiety in relation to swine flu (H1N1) among a sample of college students aged 18-24 years. This age group has been shown to be more at risk of getting swine flu than the older population and was in priority consideration in the initial stages of vaccination due to shortages.\n"," This was a cross-sectional study conducted from 1 through 10 November 2009 of a convenient sample of university students aged 18-24 in a Midwestern State in the USA. The study participants were recruited through direct solicitation via the Internet at the university.\n"," The survey instrument comprised 25 questions categorized into four sections. We developed some questions by modifying questions used in previous studies about swine flu (Rubin et al. 2009; Lau et al. 2009; Goodwin et al. 2009 ). The questionnaire elicited demographic information, and other questions encompassed knowledge about swine flu (transmissibility and prevention), governmental actions to contain the epidemic, the efficacy and safety of swine flu vaccine, personal risk reduction, and anxiety about contagion. The questionnaire required approximately 10 min to complete.\n"," Respondents were informed of the minimal risk associated with the study, assured of confidentiality, and informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time and were at liberty to not answer any question they did not want to. All respondents were advised that completing the survey implied informed consent to use the data for research purposes. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Ohio University.\n"," The data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, and standard deviations) were used to describe demographic characteristics, knowledge of swine flu, risk reduction, and prevention.\n"," Items on knowledge were scaled on a \"yes-no-don't know\" format options. The \"don't know\" as an option was included to reduce the probability of guessing, as guessing causes some variation in performance from item to item, which tends to lower the test reliability (Nunnally 1967 ).\n"," Items subscale assessing perceived self-efficacy or preventive behavior (washing hands, cleaning or disinfecting contaminated inanimate objects) utilized a 5-point Likert format ranging from 1 (strongly disagree/very unlikely) to 5 (strongly agree/most likely) with the midpoints representing ambivalent responses.\n"," Personal risk reduction was determined with questions relating to hand washing. The anxiety indicator was measured through closed format questions assessing personal worries about catching the virus (on a 4-point scale from 4 = \"very concerned\" to 1 = \"not at all concerned\").\n"," Bivariate data were analyzed by contingency table analysis except for t tests as appropriate for continuous data (for example, anxiety scale). The chi-square test was used to assess the bivariate relationship between differences in proportions and for other categorical variables. Crosstabulations were run on demographic variables and risk reduction to determine associations between race and risk reduction. All statistical tests were two-tailed and alpha= 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.\n"," There were 236 students who completed the survey. The mean age of respondents was 19.04 years (SD±1.33), almost 69.1% being female and 91.9% white.\n"," Respondents overwhelmingly agreed that washing hands with soap and water (95.1%) and cleaning or disinfecting things one might touch could reduce the possible transmission of the swine flu virus (87.8%). Table 1 shows the respondents' knowledge, beliefs, and misconceptions about swine flu.\n"," Of all respondents, 78.5% were sure that swine flu could not be transmitted by eating cooked pork, 8.6% wrongly believed that swine flu could be so, and 12.4% respondents had no idea. Furthermore, 17.8% of respondents wrongly believed that swine flu could be spread by insect bites, and 24.7% of respondents incorrectly believed that swine flu could be transmitted via water sources. Thus, the analysis shows that 36.6% of respondents had at least one misconception or unconfirmed belief and 11.0% had two or more misperceptions about swine flu contagion.\n"," With regard to confirmed methods of transmission, 13.1% were unaware that the virus could be transmitted by touching contaminated objects with an additional 6.8% of respondents indicating they were not sure. Similarly, 28.5% did not know about transmissions via droplets with 30.6% of respondents not being sure whether or not swine flu could be transmitted via droplets. Thus, if we consider those who indicated they were \"not sure\" to be those who did not know, the data showed that almost one of five respondents (19.9%) were unaware that swine flu could be transmitted via touching contaminated subjects and three of five (59.1%) were unaware of contagion through droplets.\n"," As regards getting the flu and being in crowded places, 64.8% of respondents believed that avoiding crowded places was a good way of not getting the flu, 26.7% thought otherwise, and 8.5% indicated they were not sure. Face masks as preventive measures elicited a response where 56.8% believed in their efficacy while 42.8% did not believe a face mask would protect them.\n"," When asked about regular exercise and its impact on severity of flu symptoms, 56.2% believed in its reduction of severity, 24.7% believed regular exercise did not make any difference, and 19.1% had no opinion.\n"," Almost two of three respondents (65.3%) indicated that those aged less than 25 years were most susceptible to swine flu, 17.4% stated those between 25 and 65 years, and 17.4% indicated greater than 65 years.\n"," The dearth of knowledge of swine flu was also noticed when respondents were asked to compare the severity Where totals do not add up to N, they indicate missing data between the seasonal flu and the swine flu (H1N1): 59.6% of respondents believed that swine flu was more severe than seasonal flu, 35.7% believed there was no difference, and 4.7% of respondents believed that swine flu was less severe than seasonal flu.\n"," Governmental actions to contain the H1N1 epidemic A little greater than two of five respondents (42.6%) were satisfied with the efforts of the government to control swine flu, 23.4% believed that the governmental efforts were not sufficient, and the remaining 34.0% were not sure about it. Furthermore, 93.2% of respondents did not agree and 6.8%\n"," were not sure about whether mass killing of pigs would be an effective approach to contain the swine flu pandemic.\n"," Perception about and the efficacy of swine flu immunization One of three respondents (33.5%) believed that the H1N1 vaccine was safe, 27.5% thought that it was not safe, and 39% indicated they had no knowledge about it (Fig. 1a) . When asked about whether they were going to receive the vaccine in the future, only 36.9% responded in the affirmative and 63.1% responded negatively (Fig. 1b) . Even though the swine flu vaccine was offered without cost on the college campus, our study showed that not many students had the vaccine. Only 12.3% of respondents had received the swine flu vaccine when the survey was conducted and 87.7% of respondents had not received it. There was an association between the perceived safety of the vaccine and receiving the vaccine in the future. The respondents who felt that the 2009 swine flu vaccine was safe were more likely to receive it in the future compared to those who did not (52.9 vs 6.9%, χ 2 =36.872, p<0.001).\n"," This was assessed by asking respondents whether they washed their hands more frequently than usual because of swine flu: 70.3% of respondents agreed and 29.7% disagreed. Table 2 shows associations between demographic factors and the preventive behavior of hand washing. Statistically significant differences were observed between gender and ethnicity with regard to frequent hand washing. Compared to men, women were more likely to frequently wash their hands (77.3 vs 54.8%, p<0.001), and whites were more likely to engage in preventive behavior than other races (72.4 vs 47.4%, p<0.05). In Table 2 , binary logistic regression shows significant univariate association between perceived efficacy of washing hands regularly and actually washing hands more regularly [odds ratio (OR)= 2.273, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-3.59, p<0.001].\n"," Almost half of all respondents (44.7%) have contacted family members to discuss the threat of the pandemic. However, almost seven of ten respondents indicated that the threat of swine flu infection had no impact on concentration regarding their studies or normal activities. Anxiety among students with regard to swine flu was determined by asking respondents how concerned they were about being infected by the swine flu. When the responses were categorized into a scale of 4 (1 being not at all and 4 for being very concerned), the mean anxiety of all respondents was 2.29. Greater than four of five respondents (83.1%) had some kind of anxiety, with 5.1% feeling severe anxiety. Respondents who had carried out preventive behavior against swine flu like washing hands frequently had a significantly higher level of anxiety than participants who had not (t=3.28, p=0.001, 95% CI 0.15-0.59). \n"," The strengths in this study are manifested in the fact that this survey represents a cross-sectional study of the young, aged 18-24 years. The burden of swine flu has disproportionately affected the young and they are most susceptible to the H1N1 flu virus (Crum-Cianflone et al. 2009 ). Thus, it is imperative to gauge their knowledge about transmissibility and prevention as well as attitude toward swine flu vaccine. Many studies have been conducted on swine flu, but they focused on all age groups. This study can be used to determine what is going on in the minds of younger adults who are afraid of the current pandemic of H1N1 flu, and the results from this study can be used to direct specific public health interventions or messages to the younger population.\n"," According to CDC (2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g) , misconceptions about swine flu contagion include for example insect bites, water sources, and eating cooked pork and bacon. Our study found these misconceptions which may probably have been associated with increased anxiety among this population. Furthermore, the lack of knowledge among some respondents that swine flu could be transmitted by touching contaminated object or droplets while coughing signifies to some extent that this population may not be getting the public health messages necessary to prevent transmission. Thus, we observed a very low level of knowledge even though the sample was fairly educated (all college students) and at an age that has been disproportionately affected by swine flu. This underlies the importance of government and public health authorities in providing consistent, clear updates and information about the disease and the need to assess whether messages are being understood by the target population.\n"," The CDC recommends avoiding crowded places and wearing a face mask in crowded places to protect one's mouth and nose from other people's coughs (CDC 2007) . However, 64.8% of respondents believed in avoiding crowded places and 56.8% believed a face mask would protect them. Evidence of the effectiveness of wearing a face mask is mixed (Cowling et al. 2008 ); while we can say these measures would not completely protect an individual, they would help to some extent.\n"," Immunization for swine flu on campus started 1 month preceding the survey and the study population was one of the priority groups for vaccination in its initial phase. In spite of this, only 12.3% respondents reported having received the vaccination. The notably low percentage (33.5%) that believed that the 2009 swine flu vaccine was safe showed that there were concerns in this population about safety which was not addressed by the government. We recommend that further study should be done to explore why there was dissatisfaction about the H1N1 vaccine so that appropriate steps could be taken to address these concerns.\n"," Most of the respondents were aware of which age group was more susceptible to swine flu, as 65.3% of participants correctly responded to less than 25 years. In spite of that, this did not translate into behavioral change by opting to have vaccines against H1N1. Also, in our study only 36.9% of respondents showed readiness to receive the swine flu vaccine in the future. This percentage is considerably lower than the percentage found in 1977 after the mass immunization for H1N1 in 1976 showed that 58.8% of respondents were ready for future immunization (Pearman 1978) . Even though the 1977 study was done in the general population, the results obtained were still higher than in our study in spite of the fact that our study was with those who were more at risk for H1N1 infection. Thus, we can say that public confidence about vaccines is probably much lower at present. This study also shows that respondents who did not believe in the safety of vaccine were more likely to not receive it. That signifies that addressing the safety issue of vaccine should be of paramount importance in the event of a future outbreak.\n"," An encouraging finding regarding preventive behavior was that 70.3% of the respondents were washing their hands more frequently than before. Another interesting finding was that women were more likely to adopt preventive behavior than men. Similar findings have been reported in one of the swine flu studies done in Europe (Rubin et al. 2009 ). Ethnicity was also associated with the adoption of preventive behavior. White people were more likely to adopt preventive behavior than other ethnicities. Because of the lower number of other ethnic participants, it is likely this finding may be biased. About 83.1% of people were little to very concerned about getting swine flu; this indicates high anxiety levels among young adults. This study also found that people who were more concerned were more likely to adopt preventive behavior, which implies that some form of anxiety is good. Perceived efficacy of preventive behavior was also a predictor of preventive behavior. That means people who believed that hand washing was effective in preventing swine flu were more likely to adopt the preventive behavior of hand washing. This finding implies that public health authorities should deliver messages of preventive behavior in such a way that makes their audience 100% confident about the effectiveness of that particular behavior. In this way, there would be a high chance of them adopting that preventive behavior.\n"," A previous study has shown that the swine flu and seasonal flu have some different epidemiologic characteristics but that the severity of the diseases is similar (Fraser et al. 2009 ). In our study 59.6% of participants believed that swine flu was more severe than seasonal flu, with 35.7% believing that there was no difference in severity and 4.7% believing that swine flu was less severe than seasonal flu. This finding may exist probably because of the overexaggeration of severity by media coverage in the early days of the pandemic.\n"," Potential limitations of this study include self-reports and the fact that participants were nonrandom, volunteers (selfselection), and probably might have interest in the subject matter. Furthermore, this is a cross-sectional study; hence, it has shortcomings associated with such studies. For example, the results about knowledge on swine flu might have been different if the study were conducted 2 months earlier or 2 or 6 months later. This knowledge may evolve with changes to exposure to swine flu-related information and other new situations. Thus, results obtained relating to swine flu knowledge and risk reduction may change if measured at another point in time.\n"," Furthermore, our study assessed selected preventive behaviors which were frequent hand washing with soap and avoiding touching contaminated objects. We did not cover the CDC's recommended measures such as: \"cover your nose and mouth with tissue when you cough or sneeze and throw away the tissue in the trash after you use it; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and try to avoid contact with sick people\" (CDC 2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g) .\n"," Also, the use of volunteers may not necessarily make the study representative of students in the university or the country. Other students of similar age group in other universities in the state or the country may differ. In spite of the above limitations, the population that was analyzed constitutes a critical group to be studied so that information derived can be used for future swine flu interventions to contain hysteria, encourage vaccination, or foster prevention in order to decrease infection in the population as well as mitigate severity in the event of infection. Furthermore, participants were representative of a broad geographic area, because they were all students from different places. Finally, there are very few studies with similar design and our study provides insight into a more vulnerable group in the swine flu pandemic.\n"," We conducted this study in a population vulnerable to swine flu. There is a gap in swine flu knowledge, existence of minimal risk reduction, an increased amount of anxiety among young adults, as well as skepticism about swine flu vaccine safety. These sufficient gaps warrant serious attention.\n"," The results indicate that more remains to be done because knowledge was not adequate in a population that should be more aware. Our study shows that at the height of news reports about swine flu and accompanying hysteria, some messages about vaccine safety and prevention techniques may have been lost. It is possible to deploy other methods of news dissemination such as through schools, churches, and faithbased organizations not only on swine flu awareness but also prevention methods while stressing the efficacy and safety of the swine flu vaccine. The knowledge gained from this study can be utilized by public health officials in the event of future outbreak of any infectious disease.\n","Score: 6.722050758835101\n","\n","Title: Environmental Management Stakeholder Perspectives on COVID-19 and Household Water Access in Vulnerable Communities in the Mekong Region\n","Body Text: The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined how access to clean water for drinking, hygiene, and other household uses is still an important issue for vulnerable communities in both developing and developed countries (Hannah et al. 2020 , Tortajada & Biswas 2020 . A survey of households in 23 low-income and middle-income countries in 2017-18 found almost 70% had water-related problems in the previous month that made them vulnerable to COVID-19 (Stoler et al. 2021) . A review of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) measures adopted in 84 countries showed that, while hygiene and infection prevention has been widely promoted, support for vulnerable households was often weak and coverage incomplete (Giné-Garriga et al. 2021) . Inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure are frequently identified obstacles to improving hygiene practices, and thus reducing risks of COVID-19 infection (Howard 2021) ; for example, in remote Alaskan native communities in the United States (Eichelberger et al. 2021) , and rural villages in Odishi, India (Bauza et al. 2021) . Low socioeconomic status (Aregu et al. 2021) , lack of formal rights (Larson 2020 , Tanana et al. 2021 , gender inequalities (Islam et al. 2021) , and skewed power relations (Corburn et al. 2020 , Stoler et al. 2021 ) are other sources of obstacles.\n"," The purpose of this study was to better understand the main obstacles to household water access in vulnerable communities in the Mekong Region and identify ways they might be addressed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper focuses on the perspectives of 50 government officials, and development or health experts interviewed from five countries in the Mekong Region (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam) . This qualitative evidence was complimented with selected observations from a quantitative survey of residents in 15 vulnerable communities reported in detail elsewhere (Lebel et al. 2022) . Previous work in the Mekong Region on issues of water access, supply, and quality provide a starting point from which to ask questions about the impacts of COVID-19.\n"," Access refers to having the capabilities and entitlements to use a water source or system to meet at least basic needs (Gupta & Lebel 2010) . Residents in central Yangon, Myanmar, for instance, have had access to piped water for more than 150 years (Ko & Sakai 2021) , whereas today in peri-urban Yangon, the majority of informal settlement dwellers living along the river banks do not have access to tap water (Groot & Bayrak 2019) . Instead, they had to buy water of dubious quality at high prices from vendors. Perceptions of tap water quality and familiarity with it as a source are important to whether it is drunk or not in central Yangon (Ko & Sakai 2021) . In this example, differences in access to the tap water system are related to location and land ownership status. It is unclear if the COVID-19 pandemic had any significant impacts (positive or negative) on access to water in informal urban settlements like this or other highly vulnerable communities in the Mekong Region.\n"," Supply refers to the physical availability and social allocation of water for household uses. Studies in Can Tho City, Vietnam, suggest that abilities to access alternative water resources to formal tap water system may reduce the risks of water shortages (Allen 2019), but another study showed that households that use multiple water sources had higher rates of illness (Neumann et al. 2014) , underlining the importance of considering water quality in addition to supply volumes. In one site in Northern Vietnam, reservoirs traditionally used to harvest and store rainwater for the dry season were removed to construct a coal power plant (Nga 2018) . Residents were provided with treated tap water from the river, but did not trust the quality of the water and found the supply unreliable, so they shifted back to collecting rainwater. These two examples illustrate interactions between access, supply, and quality. It is unclear if the COVID-19 outbreak in the short-term disrupted supplies or whether it renewed longer-term commitments to improving the supply of water to vulnerable communities in the Mekong Region.\n"," Quality refers to the properties of water at various points from source to use, with an emphasis here on being safe to drink and clean enough for washing hands. Ethnic minorities living in upland areas of Northern Thailand obtain drinking water from mountain streams, shallow wells, or buy commercial bottled water (Sudsandee et al. 2020) . In this latter study, all samples from mountain water supply systems were found to be contaminated. Groundwater wells, a potentially valuable drinking water source in periurban Chiang Mai, Thailand, were contaminated with E. coli and Enterococcus despite the use of \"improved\" sanitation systems (Chuah & Ziegler 2018) . In another suburban study, contamination of rainwater collected for drinking, could be explained by the lack of regular cleaning of rainwater urns (Vannavong et al. 2017 ). Water quality issues have not been addressed in most studies on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, so its importance to meeting drinking water needs and the effectiveness of hygiene programs is still unclear.\n"," The distinct vulnerabilities of women and men, elderly and children, migrants and residents, to the impacts of COVID-19 may intersect with water access, supply, and quality in differing ways. A review of WASH interventions in Myanmar focussed on internally displaced people, identified access to sanitation facilities by women, children, and the disabled as key gaps (Domini et al. 2020) . While women in Vietnam were seen by officials as the primary beneficiaries of improved domestic water supply services, they had little recognized role in planning, maintenance or decision-making (Thai & Guevara 2019) . WASH initiatives can be an entry point to women's empowerment and contribute to gender equality (Leahy et al. 2017) . A study of women-owned piped-water businesses in Cambodia also found evidence of empowerment, while observing persistent gender norms on mobility and household duties that limited income generation . It is unclear how COVID-19 interacted with household water uses or needs of women, children, the elderly or disabled in the Mekong Region.\n"," Taken together, this past work on water use of vulnerable households in the Mekong Region suggests that the importance of COVID-19 impacts with respect to problems of water access, supply, and quality are likely to vary among types of vulnerable communities. Another expectation was that the perspectives of government officials on solutions may vary by country and sector, as well as differ from that of residents. Finally, while all five countries have made progress in pursuing targets under Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6)which aims to \"ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\" (United Nations 2015)significant or major challenges remain, and are likely to have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 outbreak (Sachs et al. 2021) .\n"," This study was conducted in five countries in the Mekong Region: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Thailand is now classified as an upper middle-income country, whereas the other four are considered lower middle-income countries (World Bank 2020). The first confirmed COVID-19 case outside China was a Chinese tourist visiting Thailand (13 January 2020). By 24 March 2020, the other four countries had also had their first case. Government efforts in the five countries to control spread of the disease followed similar timelines, for example, the first round of border closures to foreign visitors began in March 2020. As of 23 August 2021, the incidence of COVID-19 per hundred thousand population, based on online datasets (Dong et al. 2020) , were from lowest to highest: Lao PDR (174), Vietnam (361), Cambodia (541), Myanmar (691), and Thailand (1507).\n"," The interviews covered views on how government programs and policies helped people cope with impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, starting broadly and then asking specifically about access, supply and quality of water for drinking, hygiene and other household uses in vulnerable communities. Informants were also asked about what else should be done and their views on the merits of pursuing four measures: improving reliability of water supply; improving quality of water supplied; expanding dry season storage; and providing low-income households with free alcohol gel for washing hands. In a few cases, we searched online for additional details about projects and policy issues raised in the key informant interviews. Any such sources used, mostly newspaper articles and press releases, are cited in the text.\n"," Altogether 50 interviews were done, primarily between 6 May and 30 June 2021 in the five countries: Cambodia (6), Myanmar (7), Laos (10), Thailand (17), and Vietnam (10). Four late interviews were done in November 2021. By major stakeholder groups, the distribution was: 40 government officials, including from water (13), health (10), other (12), local (5); and 10 non-state actors, including from NGOs (5), academics (4), private consultants (1).\n"," Interviews were conducted in local languages, mainly via online or telephone calls, and occasionally in person. When consent for recording was provided, the interviews were later transcribed. When interviewees asked not to be recorded, notes and summaries were made instead. In some cases, the informant asked to type their responses in their own time and send back to the researchers. Interview documents were translated into English for coding and analysis using the NVIVO 12 software.\n"," In the results section, references to individual interview sources are shown with an interview number superscript. The full list of interviewees and their anonymized affiliations is provided in Table 1 of the Supplementary Materials.\n"," In-depth interviews were not done with members of the vulnerable communities, as this would require extended travel by the researchers and long face-to-face interaction, increasing COVID-19 risks to all. Instead, we drew on a quantitative survey of largely closed questions that could be administered simply and quickly, often with trained local data collectors. Our primary source for information on the views of members of vulnerable communities, therefore, was a survey of 1559 individuals in 15 locations across five countries in the Mekong Region (Table 1 ). The surveys were mostly done between 20 January and 21 April 2021, except for a few late responses in Myanmar up to 2 June 2021.\n"," In this paper, we focus on just a small part of the survey questionnaire dealing with support for interventions (same as those noted above for other stakeholders) and a few indicators of vulnerability and household water difficulties because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Vulnerability indicators included ethnic minority status, not having a formal education, and daily pay for work. For water difficulties, this included items related to access, supply, and quality. For drinking water, for example, this included \"having to drink water that smelt, looked or tasted bad,\" disrupted delivery, water becoming more expensive, and being impacted by drought. A more detailed description of the data collection methods, and an analysis of the full quantitative survey appears in a companion paper (Lebel et al. 2022) .\n"," The findings below are organized around the inter-related issues of water access, supply, and quality. In the past year, many respondents from 15 vulnerable communities had experienced not having enough clean water to drink (48%) or wash hands (36%). There were some differences among vulnerable communities (Table 1) .\n"," A long-term approach to COVID-19 recovery and reducing water access problems is to extend water distribution, for instance, by expanding infrastructure within or adjacent to existing service areas or developing a new source. In Thailand, the Provincial Waterworks Authority \"budget is limited and the installation of pipes to expand area serviced must be worth the investment.\" 30 The latter sentiment, an example of the corporate logic of fee-charging public water authorities. The quickest way to get clean water to an unconnected community is through a request to the subdistrict (TAO) or local government. The local government will then cooperate with the waterworks authority, \"which is ready to assist.\" 28 Through this pathway, the work will be done more quickly as \"the budget will be allocated faster.\" 28 According to an NGO worker, if you are not the main village, but a small and remote one, then \"you will be among the last villages to be helped. It is local politics.\" 27 Furthermore, local authorities are adept at \"pushing the burden onto people in the community to take responsibility\" 27 for securing their own water resources. In Laos, projects in remote areas may be difficult to access by road in the rainy season, hindering development of water infrastructure. 7 Some places where NGOs work \"have no vehicle access due to poor road conditions, and thus need to walk about 10-20 kilometers, carrying things to the villages.\" 16 Another difficulty for water systems in remote locations is a lack of electricity, in which case one option isif have enough fundsto use a solar-powered pump. 7, 13 Apart from remoteness, capacities to provide water services are often limited by budgets. If budget is available but limited, one approach is to \"make two or three more watering points in the community,\" 8 and when more funds are available connect the water system directly to each house. In the context of COVID-19, it is desirable to have direct connections, as this helps reduce risks of contaminated supply points, and makes maintaining social distancing easier than when collecting water from a shared community access point. 7 Infrastructure within the home, including taps, washing stations, storage, and latrines make it easier to follow good hygiene practices, but cost money. Helping vulnerable groups cope with the impacts of COVID-19 is \"not only about water, it is also about WASH, or sanitation and hygiene, hardware and software.\" 9 Government policy in Laos is for all people to have access to WASH services in line with SDG 6, but \"need assistance from outside the country.\" 9 An official in the Ministry of Health in Laos explained plans for a program supported by WHO to upgrade tap water systems \"for all, not only for vulnerable groups\" to be safe to drink. 13 Informants from Laos, in particular, were reluctant to acknowledge vulnerable groups, instead emphasizing \"access for all\".\n"," The cost of water services limits access. Writing in April 2020, Horn Chanvoitey of Future Forum in Cambodia argued that the impending COVID-19 outbreak \"exposes one of the Kingdom's great inequalities: access to clean water\" (Chanvoitey 2020), while an official admitted that \"the poor are lacking the ability to connect to clean water services\" (Koemsoeun 2020).\n"," Governments in most areas reduced water prices in service areas for a couple of months during the COVID-19 pandemic; some also reduced connection charges or extended due dates for service payments. Thus, in Thailand, the Provincial Waterworks Authority reduced water fees by 10% for two monthly billing cycles, first in February-March 2021, then again in May-July 2021. 28, 34 In Laos, the Water Supply Enterprise in Vientiane Province reduced water fees by 5% for 3 months for all persons, no focus on the vulnerable or poor. 11 Another Lao official with the Department of Water Supply, said they had a program for free household water connections. 8 In Vietnam, cuts to water prices were accompanied with cuts for electricity and telecommunication services in areas impacted by COVID-19 control measures such as lockdowns (Tu & Tuan 2021) . Across countries, these pricing-related measures largely apply to less vulnerable communities already in service areasmany other water insecure households do not benefit.\n"," Those who live in the northern parts of Pindaya, Myanmar, for instance, must buy water \"from the seller who takes the water from an urban lake\" or a Monastery tube well. 18 Plans are to drill tube wells and concrete storage tanks in five villagesa village water committee has already been established to maintain the system. 18 In upland sites in Thailand, access to clean water is very expensive if must cart in by truck, so it is a last resort when other sources are unavailable. 27 High prices of bottled drinking water may also limit access for the poor. Thus, governments need to \"work closely with the private sector,\" namely drinking water factories, to \"control the prices of drinking water and make sure that consumers are not taken advantage of during the COVID-19 outbreak.\" 12 Respondents were more likely to report that drinking water became more expensive as a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak in Myanmar (29%), Cambodia (25%), Thailand (24%), and relatively less likely in Laos (5%) and Vietnam (3%).\n"," An important coping response to high prices was to switch to lower cost water sources. In the study sites in Vietnam, the poor and those whose income was greatly reduced by the COVID-19 outbreak, switched to boiled water from wells to drink rather than spend money on bottled water. 42, 46 In Myanmar, some people \"cannot afford to buy bottled water, so they used river water for drinking. Consequently, people suffered from other health problem.\" 22 People were more likely to switch to lower quality sources as a response to COVID-19 in Vietnam (26%) than other countries (6-11%).\n"," Extra expenses at home, including for water, may be a difficulty for low-income households, especially if COVID-19 also resulted in sudden unemployment. 36 To some extent financial assistance may help cope with rising costs or loss of income. In Thailand, access to government assistance related to COVID-19, however, required an identity card, and in several instances, a smart phone, effectively putting key resources beyond reach of the most vulnerable individuals. 35, 49 Nevertheless, during 2020, survey respondents from Thailand (64%) and Myanmar (57%) were much more likely to have received formal financial assistance than those in other countries (2-9%).\n"," An official in Thailand acknowledged \"there are still people who do not have access to clean water, including some ethnic minority communities and foreign workers.\" 31 Thus, \"people living outside the service area, for example, ethnic groups living in the uplands, won't receive water services from the Provincial Authority.\" 28 They must seek support from other government offices. The \"cardless\" in Thailand, not recognized as citizens and thus without an identity card, face many difficulties accessing government services. The identity card is also linked to a house registration document, which is needed to request for water or electricity connection. 36 Residents of informal settlements in Myanmar are without the land documents they need to access treated and piped water, so they \"have to use river water for their domestic uses, as there is no clean water access for them.\" 20 During the COVID-19 lockdown measures, an identity card was needed to be displayed when moving between areas. In Myanmar, \"migrant workers who do not have legal registration in the township are among the most vulnerable.\" 20 Rights to water services, in practice, are not secure when individuals lack an identity card, house registration, and land documents.\n"," Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people \"have to use more water in their daily activities than in normal times in order to\" wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease, but some cannot follow the guidelines as they did not have enough water. 23 The COVID-19 \"crisis is a stark reminder that the Cambodian government has not sufficiently addressed the issue of insufficient access to clean water and sanitation\" (Chanvoitey 2020) .\n"," Lack of specificity with regards to vulnerable groups has been an important limitation in strengthening access. In the COVID-19 response in Laos, \"there is no specific programs for elderly, disabled, women and girls.\" 14 Similarly, in Myanmar, most government support programs are for all people, under the policy principle of \"no one left behind.\" 19 Nevertheless, the value of more targeted programs was acknowledged by some officials, for example, one argued \"government support programs should place more emphasis on specific vulnerable groups like the elderly, migrants, children and disabled.\" 21 School and childcare center closures impact children and their caregivers; children no longer eat lunch or drink milk provided at school. 36 Younger children need to be supervised, limiting the time parents can earn an income outside the home. 36 Likewise, residents of informal settlements suffer from lack of access to clean water during the pandemic, and therefore should be targeted for assistance by specific supporting programs. 20 In Thailand, this is difficult to provide as they lack house registration documents. 29 Regardless, an official argued that \"government agencies must have a plan, and from a humanitarian perspective must help\" those without access to clean drinking water. 31 In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic increased awareness of water access issues among government officials concerned about WASH services. Prices of tap water, for example, were lowered. There was no evidence of changes to formal rights of vulnerable communities to access water services.\n"," Dry season shortages were an important reason for disrupted water supplies. Half of the surveyed respondents (49%) said their household water sources were impacted by seasonal drought. Respondents in upland sites were more likely than those in urban sites to have their water supplies impacted by seasonal drought. Households impacted by drought were more likely than those not so impacted to support actions to increase community water storage.\n"," In Dak Lak, Vietnam, water shortages are most common towards end of the dry season (March-May), with impacts greatest in remote areas, ethnic minority villages and poor households. 46 Those with shallow dug wells are impacted more than those with deeper drilled wells, as the former dry out. 38, 43 Women are impacted more than men because they \"have to carry water home from their neighbors [well] .\" 40 A lack of water for hygiene impacts \"not only COVID-19, but other diseases such as hand, foot and mouth disease\" 42 among children. In 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 coincided with water shortages, exacerbating the challenges of maintaining hygiene for those without access to tap water. 38 Increasing water storage is one solution recommended by officials and experts in all countries. In Laos, officials encouraged villagers to collect rainwater and build big tanks to store water. 14 In Cambodia, communities are encouraged to extend public ponds and drill community wells to help improve dry season water storage. 1 Households are also encouraged to collect and store rainwater. Financial resources are important to making own water storage pond, as it is costly to make a pond big enough to last the dry season. 25 Moreover, \"water shortage problems for personal hygiene became worse in the pandemic period.\" 20 In Myanmar, the government had a program, \"not only for the COVID-19 period but for the long-term water security,\" for some villages to build water tanks to store harvested rainwater. 18 Drilling wells is another important option to secure water supplies. In Laos, wells are usually more than 60 meters deep with a standard minimum of 40 meters. 15, 16 In Vietnam, wells were around 60 meters. 39 Drilling wells is expensive 41 so lower-income households depend on community drilling projects funded by the state or NGOs. 42 Government programs \"support drilled wells for communes that are short of water in the dry season and do not have access to tap water.\" 44 Even so, in Buon Don, Vietnam, \"many drilled wells do not have water because of the rocky terrain.\" 45 In peri-urban sites, such as those in Thailand, water quality in shallow wells is often poor. 24 Survey respondents in Vietnam (87%) were the most likely, and in Thailand the least likely (5%), to use groundwater wells as a source of drinking waterwith the other three countries being intermediate (30-38%).\n"," The dominant view of officials was that the provision of tap water was unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak. In the city of Vientiane, Laos, \"local communities can get access to clean water to use in toilets/bathrooms, washing hands, and in their house.\" 13 The city has a good system so the impacts of COVID-19 were small, \"but in rural area impacts were greater.\" 7 In Vietnam, \"COVID-19 did not have much effect on people's access to safe drinking water and sanitation.\" 38 A district waterworks official in Thailand said that \"the spread of COVID-19 was not affected because water production was maintained as normal.\" 30 In Thailand, \"the spread of the COVID-19 virus has not directly affected people's access to clean water in areas that use water from the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority.\" 34 At the same time, a regional waterworks official in Thailand noted that for maintenance and servicing, the \"key problem they encountered was entering areas designated as red zones for controlling spread of COVID-19.\" 29 In Laos, some water supply projects were abandoned or significantly delayed following disruptions to work caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. 7 With Vientiane city and province locked down, experts cannot come to work, and thus water supply improvement programs were delayed. 9, 13 In Myanmar, at times of critical shortages prior to COVID-19, \"water was provided house-by-house, but during outbreak could only fill concrete tanks in middle of village\" due to concern about disease transmission. 18 \"Moreover, despite that some clean water is accessible, it is not enough quantity for their daily use, especially water for handwashing and hygiene.\" 21 As a temporary solution, alcohol-based hand sanitizers were distributed for free in some areas in each country for short periods, often as part of hygiene information campaigns or private donation initiatives in response to COVID-19. Hand sanitizers were otherwise too costly for residents in vulnerable communities. 9, 23, 27, 49 In Laos, \"there are many households that cannot get alcohol gel for washing hands, because they lack the money needed to buy it.\" 14 When they were given a bottle of gel they had to use it sparingly -\"so we use alcohol gel for washing hands only when we go outside, and we use soap when we stay at home where we often wash our hands.\" 7 Support for programs among residents surveyed to \"provide low-income households with free alcohol gel for washing hands\" was higher in Thailand (46%) and Cambodia (44%), than in Laos (28%) and Myanmar (22%). Government officials in Laos and Myanmar pointed out that they had supplies and budgets for only a fraction of those in potential need. 15,18 A medical officer said they prioritized \"providing hand gel to villages with water access problems, in order to save water, while acknowledging we also have to create water sources for them in the long term.\" 23 Drinking water supplies were temporarily disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreaks in some locations in Laos, as \"local authorities did not allow them access to the village to deliver drinking water, to all outsiders.\" 10 Later on the provincial and district COVID-19 operation units intervened and instructed that drinking water was to be delivered as normal. 10 Overall, a quarter of the households (23%) surveyed in vulnerable communities experienced disrupted delivery of drinking water because of the COVID-19 outbreak. This is a larger group than implied in interviews with state officials and NGOs. Just under half of households overall supported interventions to improve the reliability of water supplies.\n"," In Myanmar, the policy gap between national level and ward level, spanning six levels in the administrative hierarchy, is large and difficult to navigate. 20 Most policy and regulation are top-down, with many limitations emerging, leading an informant to argue an urgent need to \"have feedback from both implementers and local people.\" 21 Moreover, a recurrent problem for established but vulnerable communities in Thailand looking to engage with the state is that there are \"too many players\" 36 with stakes in water resource management. An academic characterized the COVID-19 governance challenge: \"Understand that the public do not have a role in offering solutions or ideas for what the government should do, what measures it should take, to help the people. There are no people at all; there are experts and civil servants as far as the eye can see. There is no civil society.\" 49 While the reliability of water supplies to households can be improved by drilling wells to exploit groundwater and concrete tanks to store rainwater, community level projects typically require \"a lot of negotiation with villagers\" around choosing locations for wells, tanks and pipe networks as land-uses are impacted. 18 Water projects are managed \"to allow the community to participate, meaning that villagers have to help dig and lay the pipes themselves. There is no budget for digging and laying pipes.\" 32 There is also training for the water management committee on how to use the equipment and reduce risks of contamination, for instance, through rules regarding allowable activities near the well. 16 Communities may be required to establish a water fund based on household contributions and use it to pay for electricity, maintenance, and repairs. 7, 13 In Thailand, one community managed a coin-operated reverse osmosis drinking water filtration and treatment system. The system is popular because it is cheap and conveniently located along the main road, and thus also used by other villages. 32 The sales are sufficient to replace filters and cover costs of electricity and a technician when repairs are needed. 32 A village fund committee including headmen and sub-district office manages the dispenser, a separate committee to that manages the ageing village mountain water supply. 32 Water management according to community agreed rules in the mountain system is important 36 for water allocation: \"There will be discussions at the community level about how much water can be used, because we are upstream. How much will we have to use, and besides, we will have to let people downstream use it too.\" 27 Such social allocation systems were maintained and proved useful during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n"," In summary, water supply was only disrupted for short periods, if at all, by the COVID-19 outbreak. Dry season shortages remained a key source of supply disruptions in some communities and impacted on hygiene measures. The favored long-term response being to drill more (and deeper) wells or larger storage ponds.\n"," Groups vulnerable to poor water quality and COVID-19 include \"migrant workers, casual workers, and low-income families in the township.\" 22 And \"even though they wash their hands regularly, the quality of the water they access is not good for use.\" 20 A minority of residents surveyed in the past year \"had to drink water that smelt, looked, or tasted bad\" (17%) or \"wash hands with water thought was dirty or unsafe\" (23%). In the vulnerable communities studied in Myanmar, \"for drinking, most use bottled water, but for the poor families, they must use both pond water and river water for both cooking and drinking, although it is not safe for their health.\" 21 Around half of the individuals surveyed (53%) agreed that actions should be taken to \"improve the quality of water supplied so it is safe to drink\". Experts largely concurred with some bureaucrats, seeing it as a core mission of governments. 31 In Thailand, \"the master plan stipulates that every village must have clean drinking water. It is written in the plan, but actually doing it according to the plan is difficult.\" 36 The core \"mission of providing clean drinking water has been transferred to local government\" alongside budgets, but as they also have large mandates, the result is that providing clean water is not always a priority. 31 Adequate budgets for maintaining water treatment systems, replacing filters, for example, is also important. 49 The Department of Health in Thailand monitors water quality for the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority. 34 Since the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Environmental Health Working Group has been monitoring for potential contamination and coordinating the management of water quality in Chiang Mai province. 33 A key technical measure was to raise free chlorine levels from 0.2-0.5 ppm to more than 1.0 ppm. The Department of Groundwater Resources introduced additional measures for the water production teams, in order to reduce risks of COVID-19 spread, including wearing of gloves and hats, and additional cleaning routines. 31 Local village tap water supply systems in Thailand normally do not get government support to use disinfectants. A public health academic recommended that \"the government should promote the addition of chlorine to reduce the contamination of pathogens in the community or village water supply systems.\" 48 Some managers learn about the use of chlorine, but face another obstacle: \"villagers do not want to use water that smells of chlorine.\" 48 Even if water meets standards where it is produced, if the pipe system is not well-maintained, tap water may not be safe to drink. 48\n"," Locally produced drinking water \"is cheap and easy to buy, but when we look back on the water production process, some small drinking water plants might not be up to standard.\" 48 Small bottling companies that don't have their own water treatment equipment buy water from a larger producer, and in the handling, for instance, putting on caps, there may be contamination. 48 Governments need to monitor and enforce laws, for example, when failing to meet standards, and \"provide water that is really clean to the people.\" 48 An official in Thailand summarized that \"so far, no coronavirus 2019 has been detected in drinking water, and based on current information, the risk of contamination of drinking water is low.\" 47 Drinking water dispensers were not used in study sites in Cambodia and Laos, uncommon in Vietnam (6%), and more familiar in Myanmar (21%) and Thailand (48%). A stable electricity supply is an important pre-requisite to having reverse osmosis water treatment facilities, including coin-operated dispensers. 27 On-going maintenance, for example, to change filters, is also important for water quality. 48 Monitoring show that \"coin-operated water dispensers, used by laborers and low-income people, are easily contaminated,\" 48 and as a shared access point, a potential source of COVID-19 infection. 48 Local government in Chiang Mai recognized the need to keep coinoperated water dispensers clean, 32 especially during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n"," Upland residents and officials, although they live or work in different elevation zones in the landscape, had similar views (reasoning) regarding the importance of watershed forests for protecting water resources. To protect water sources from degradation, \"the conservation and restoration of watershed forests\" is key to \"sustainable and secure water resources.\" 36 In the upland communities in Chiang Mai, an NGO member explained how \"we use our knowledge and beliefs in water management, such as taking care of watershed forests. There are prohibitions on disturbing watershed forests.\" 27 An official from a water enterprise serving Vientiane underlined that \"need to reserve the forest in upstream due to climate change issue, it is very significant for water supplies.\" 11 Dry season shortages are understood by these actors to be a consequence of deforestation. 8 In rural areas, \"the community needs to understand that if we farm with dangerous chemicals, the water will become contaminated.\" 36 An important part of dealing with dry season water challenges is for the \"community to take measures to protect their water sources.\" 7 In urban areas, lockdowns during the COVID-19 outbreak made solid waste and wastewater management more challenging, especially from medical facilities. 48 Groundwater wells, according to one official in Laos, should be separated from toilets by at least 30 meters. 16 During COVID-19 pandemic, some authorities and local communities paid more attention to the sanitation requirements of water systems. 16 In summary, water quality issues have been a concern of both residents and officials in all five countries. The COVID-19 outbreak amplified concerns about the importance of clean water for drinking and hygiene.\n"," The key finding of this study was that, despite rapid and pervasive social and economic development across the Mekong Region, difficulties in accessing sufficient clean water for drinking and hygiene persist in certain vulnerable communities. Experiences in migrant worker camps, informal city settlements, and remote minority villages, suggest that these difficulties, exposed by the COVID-19 outbreak, are routinely underestimated by officials or fall into institutional cracks. In normal times, these vulnerable communities are rarely visited by water agencies. Communities are expected to handle problems themselves, and thus the limitations of water systems pass largely unnoticed. Various agencies responsible for constructing water infrastructure or providing treated water have their own service areas, budgets, and procedures for adjusting water distribution, adding delivery points, opening new connections or developing new water sources. No one is directly responsible for water systems in these communities. Coordination across government agencies, as well as collaboration with residents and other non-state actors (Corburn et al. 2020 ), helps secure project financing (Howard et al. 2020) , and ensure implementation leads to improved access.\n"," Limited rights, high prices, and remote locations were common obstacles to water access. Rights to water, in practice, are not secure when individuals lack an identity card, house registration, travel or land documents. High prices of water for drinking or hygiene are an issue for lowincome households, in particular those on daily wages or whose livelihoods have been disrupted by COVID-19 measures such as lockdowns or business and border closures. In an earlier study in rural Vietnam, high connection fees were the main reason poor households did not access piped water (Carrard et al. 2019 ). In the current study, reduced water service fees of around 10% for a couple of months during the COVID-19 outbreak, while popular, did not benefit the most vulnerable households, for instance, in informal urban settlements without metered connections. The free water directive introduced in Ghana went much further than the public utilities in the Mekong Region, promising six months of free water to domestic users, but also struggled to reach poor and water insecure households (Smiley et al. 2020) . Remote communities faced with seasonal shortages in the availability of clean water lie beyond current service areas of water authorities, and do not have sufficient funds to develop new water sources by themselves. A sustained effort is needed to identify, assist, and empower water insecure individuals at risk, as they are not automatically visible to programs catering to the general population, even in the context of a pandemic response with its emphasis on reducing transmission.\n"," In this study, the COVID-19 outbreak temporarily disrupted supplies in some sites, and interrupted water programs or maintenance in others. A global commentary suggested that the combination of a drought and pandemic could be disastrous with severe impacts on agricultural livelihoods, employment, and nutrition in local and wider food systems (Mishra et al. 2021) . The sensitivity to drought of upland communities in this study was a source of concern to some officials and experts interviewed. In the uplands of Vietnam, for example, water shortages are common towards the end of the dry season. Residents drill wells, build storage ponds, and save water for domestic uses, sharing when they must. Governments and residents agree that further investments in drilling groundwater wells, rainwater harvesting structures, increasing storage, and watershed conservation are needed. Similar perspectives among stakeholders on ways to meet needs using local water resources are a starting point to improving supply, but is not enoughthere must also be sufficient public investment for infrastructure to reach all households. Elsewhere in Vietnam, unreliable tap water services led people to access alternative sources (Allen 2019, Nga 2018). Regionally, there was little evidence, aside from reaffirmations of the importance of WASH programs, that the COVID-19 outbreak would stimulate improvements in the supply and allocation of water to vulnerable communities. Rather, early concerns that the outbreak may delay achievement of the SDGs (The Lancet Public H (2020)) still seem to hold, in particular, for the case of Myanmar (Sachs et al. 2021) .\n"," Perceptions of the importance of water quality problems often differed between officials and residents. In the uplands, water quality may be perceived as good by residents, but treatment is still essential given high rates of contamination (Sudsandee et al. 2020) . In lowland settlements with improved sanitation, poorly sited and maintained toilets can still contaminate ground water used for drinking and hygiene in the household, causing disease outbreaks (Chuah & Ziegler 2018) . In dense informal settlements, these contamination risks are even higher. The high dependence on bottled drinking water in many of the vulnerable communities studied, reflects concerns with the quality of tap water and other alternatives. Contamination of water during handling and storage, shown to be important in other studies from the region (Shaheed et al. 2014 , Vannavong et al. 2017 , was also noted by interviewees in this study. Threats to water quality from contamination need to be addressed by investments in monitoring, treatment, and protection. In the longer-term, it is important to protect water sources from degradation (Hannah et al. 2020 ). Water quality was an important issue for vulnerable populations in the Mekong Region.\n"," There was widespread agreement among residents and officials that women were more vulnerable and impacted more by COVID-19 than menin line with expectations (Adams et al. 2021) . Women use water in the household for cooking and cleaning, and were more likely to follow good handwashing hygiene practices (Lebel et al. 2022) . Experts and officials, however, said very little about the roles of women in addressing water-related difficulties, or the benefits to women of solutions proposed or adopted. Officials in Laos, for instance, tended to discuss solutions to water access issues as being \"for all\" and were reluctant to emphasize special treatment for specific vulnerable groups. In other countries, perspectives were more diverse, and included calls for both greater humanitarian assistance to specific vulnerable groups, and for isolation or control of others seen as a threat of further disease outbreaks.\n"," This study is one of the first to explore the implications of differences in stakeholder perspectives for programs aimed at improving water systems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public actors from different sectors or levels of government perceive and respond to problems of water access, supply, and quality differently, reflecting mandates and organizational interests. Water officials, when addressing immediate COVID-19 concerns, emphasized their actions taken to reduce risks of transmission through their services; whereas when addressing issues of water supply, they referred to expanding service areas or improving reliability of services. Health officials focussed on the COVID-19 crisis, when it came to water, were mostly concerned about ensuring adequate supplies of clean water to healthcare or quarantine facilities, and risks of contamination from wastewater. Officials with responsibilities for administrative areas at local or provincial levels have diverse planning and implementation responsibilities when it comes to water resources and COVID-19 responses. In general, local governments did not put improving access to water for vulnerable groups as a local development priority. These differences in perspectives help explain the institutional cracks that leave vulnerable communities underserved.\n"," The views of residents, officials, and experts regarding both the significance of water access, supply, and quality issues, and what needs to be done to address them, while often overlapping, also diverged in a few important areas. Based on these observations and other findings of this study, we have five program suggestions.\n"," First, special programs are needed to help highly vulnerable communities gain secure access to sufficient clean water for drinking and hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. Programs aimed at the general population are not enough. Coordination mechanisms are needed, for example, an inter-ministerial working group at the provincial level, to ensure that no one is left behind.\n"," Second, emergency measures under COVID-19 outbreak should be linked into recovery programs in a way that leaves water systems better prepared for the next pandemic. This could start by ensuring that weaknesses of water systems, exposed by the outbreak, are documented and the lessons shared, so that these weaknesses can be addressed by postcrisis recovery programs. Costs are always an issue. One way to prioritize needs and attract external funding is to explicitly link efforts to improve water systems to WASH programs and SDG 6 targets for drinking water and sanitation.\n"," Third, as the barriers to improving water supply and quality in vulnerable communities are diverse and contextspecific, it is important that households are consulted in the design of WASH programs and the development of water resources. This includes evaluation of water supply infrastructure, treatment technologies, and institutional arrangements such as management committees and water service fees. Doing so would help narrow the gap between the experiences of vulnerable people and the views of officials and their experts.\n"," Fourth, the private sector played an important role in the provision of drinking water. Quality and prices of water, as well as the adherence to hygiene practices in transport and at shared water collection points, however, need to be monitored and regulated by governments. In terms of outbreak context, greater attention is needed on the regular cleaning and servicing of shared water points such as coin-operated dispensers. In terms of longer-term recovery and preparedness, the public needs greater reassurance of the reliability of tap water quality, otherwise bottled water systems will continue to predominate drinking water supplies.\n"," Fifth, the role of the natural environment in protecting water resources needs to be more widely recognized by residents and officials. In the uplands, support for developing local water systems, for instance, could be linked to commitments to protect upper tributary watersheds; while in the lowlands, sources of pollutants and contaminants need to be managed, including from agricultural fields, human settlements, and industrial activities.\n"," In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that a combination of shorter-term and longer-term measures addressing water access, supply, and quality difficulties are needed to improve provisioning of clean water for drinking and hygiene in normal times, as well as during epidemics, in vulnerable communities in the Mekong Region.\n","Score: 6.69311825726341\n","\n","Title: \n","Body Text: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan, China. The virus transmitted from person to person has spread rapidly all over the world [1] . The first COVID-19 incident in Turkey was detected on 11th March 2020. Following the announcement of the first case, some preventive measures have been implemented at the end of March 2020 across the country. Within the scope of the measures applied during the pandemic process, it became compulsory to wear a disposable facial mask before going out, many employees switched to home-working system, schools were closed and students continued their education at home. A curfew was imposed on individuals under 20 and over 65 constantly, and on certain days for those between the ages of 20 and 65. After April and May with quarantine, the Turkish government initiated the new normalization phase at the beginning of June 2020 [2, 3] .\n"," Symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis due to grass pollen allergy occur in April, May, and June when grass pollen is high in the air in the northern hemisphere. In order to prevent allergic airway disease symptoms, pollen atopic patients are advised to wear a mask to reduce exposure to pollen as much as possible, and avoid going out and doing outdoor activities during periods of high pollen Concentration [4, 5] . However, due to the social conditions, our daily routines, and negligence, the recommendations cannot be followed sufficiently and it is not possible to be protected from exposure to pollen allergens. Therefore, it is not known to what extent preventive measures are effective in pollen allergy [4] [5] [6] .\n"," This year, as in many countries, the pollen season coincided with the first wave of the pandemic in our country. Due to the measures taken, people mostly stayed inside, wore a mask when they got out during April and May. But with the start of the normalization process in June, they began spending more time outside. With the precautions taken during the pandemia period, indirectly, individuals allergic to pollen are expected to have less contact with the allergen [7] . Therefore we hypothesized that individuals with seasonal allergic rhinitis and/or asthma due to grass pollen would be less symptomatic in the 2020 pollen season.\n"," The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of lockdown and wearing masks during the pandemic process on allergic airway disease symptoms and to compare them with the previous pollen season.\n"," This study was planned as a prospective questionnare based study performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by Ankara University Ethics Committee (code: i6-341-20). A 24-item multiple choice questionnaire was prepared in Google forms and sent to the cell-phones of the subjects who were followed up in our polyclinic with the diagnosis of seasonal allergic rhinitis ± asthma with grass pollen allergy. All of the subjects live in Ankara Province. This survey questioned the attitude of patients about spending time outside the home, going to work, wearing masks, and taking shower on return home. Presence of nasal and ocular symptoms between April and July 2020 was also evaluated by the use of survey. In addition, subjects were asked to compare this year's symptoms of allergic rhinitis and asthma with the same period of last year.\n"," During the season, number of airborne grass pollen was determined by Burkard volumetric 7-day spore trap. Burkard volumetric spor trap is currently the most common method of sampling airborne pollens. Samples collected with this method are analyzed by using light microscopes. The trap was placed on the roof of the building at the campus of Ankara University at an altitude of 30 m above ground level. Atmospheric sampling and analysis were performed according to the method described by the Spanish Aerobiological Network (REA) [8] . The pollen counts were converted into daily average concentrations (grains/m 3 ).\n"," Statistical analyzes were made using SPSS ver. 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The normality of distribution was examined by visual (histogram and probability graphs) and analytical methods (Kolmogrov-Smirnov/Shapiro-Wilk tests). Frequency of distrubitions was analyzed and descriptive statistics were calculated using the mean and standard deviation for normally distributed variables, using the median and interquartile range for nonnormally distributed variables. Categorical data were evaluated by chi-square test. For p < 0.05 for all tests performed, the results were considered statistically significant.\n"," A total of 222 grass pollen allergic patients (129 females, 93 males) were included in the study with the mean age of 35.04 ± 11.06 years. Thirty-three percent (n = 75) of them had asthma as well as allergic rhinitis. Sixty-six percent of the study group (n = 147) were employed. At the beginning of the study; among these 147 patients; 17.6% (n = 26) were on unpaid leave, 37.41% (n = 55) were working from home and 44.89% (n = 66) continued office working. Approximately half of the subjects who go to work (42.5%) stated that they went 5-7 times a week, 33.3% for 3-4 days, 20% for 1-2 days a week. One-third of the subjects said that they did not spend more than 3 hours outside, while the rates of using a face mask and taking a shower when they get home were as high as 83.3% and 60.8%, respectively.\n"," Among the employed patients from beginning of April to the end of June, it was observed that the rate of home-office workers gradually decreased and the rate of office workers increased significantly. Moreover, it is noteworthy that there was a significant increase in the number of days at work. (Fig. 1) In addition, it was observed that the number of people who said they very rarely went outside decreased both among the employed (n = 147) and the unemployed ones (n = 75) from April to June ( How did the pandemic affect seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms? In contrast, the number of subjects working from the office in June was higher compared to April and May (p < 0.001, p = 0.000, respectively). (B) In terms of working days, the number of subjects working 5-7 days a week in June was more than in April and May (p = 0.000), and the number of subjects reporting that they rarely went to work was far less in June than in April and May (p < 0.01).\n"," patients than unemployed subjects and increased gradually in both groups from April to June. For employed people proportion of the patients spending more than 3 hours outdoors by months (April, May, June) were 24%, 27%, and 49% and for unemployed group, the rates were 23%, 25%, 27%, respectively. In general, subjects in our study group spent 1-3 hours when they went outside during these three months (33.8%, 35.1%, 38.7%, respectively). But the percentage of the patients who spent more than 3 hours outdoors increased from April to June (18.5%, 21.7%, 39.4%, respectively). Monthly distribution of the rate of using face mask was 83.3%, 86%, 85% in April, May, and June respectively. Most of our subjects prefered to take a shower on their return home with 60.8%, 58.1%, 54.5%, respectively by months.\n"," Patients were examined in terms of nasal and eye symptoms, and it was seen that their complaints increased in June compared to April and May (p = 0.000). There was no significant difference in nasal and eye symptoms between employed and unemployed groups. Furthermore, symptoms did not differ between the subjects on unpaid leave, home-office workers, and office workers. In addition, there was no difference in symptoms in terms of using face mask. However, patients on unpaid leave and unemployed subjects who stated that they very rarely went outside had less nasal itching (p = 0.009) in April and less nasal obstruction in April (p = 0.007), and May (p = 0.006) compared to those who spent more time outside.\n"," When nasal and eye symptoms of the patients were compared with the same period of the previous year; 35.1% (n = 78) of the patients stated that their symptoms were less, while 45% (n = 100) said they were the same in April; 36% (n = 80) of the individuals reported less, 43.7% (n = 97) had similar symptoms this year in May. The rate of those who said their symptoms were less than previous year was 30% (n = 67) and more than last year was 25.2% (n = 56) in June (Fig. 2) . While there was no difference in asthma symptoms in April, May, 4/8 https://apallergy.org https://doi.org/10.5415/apallergy.2021.11.e16\n"," How did the pandemic affect seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms? and June in patients with asthma, nearly half of the group stated that their complaints were same as the previous year.\n"," The patients describing symptoms less than, same as or more than the previous year were compared according to being outdoors or indoors. During April and May 2020, the proportion of active work days in all groups was seen to decrease significantly. However, compared to last year, it was observed that the rate of going to work decreased more in those who stated that they were less symptomatic this year than those with complaints the same or more than last year ( Table 2) .\n"," Grass pollen measurement results were evaluated as monthly averages, and it was seen that the pollen level was lower this year in every 3 months compared to the previous year (Fig. 3) .\n"," Our study showed that, patients with pollen allergy were less symptomatic when they spent less time outdoors during the pollen season. The treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis include avoidance of pollen exposure and prescription of allergy medications [9, 10] . Most physicians are well informed of the pharmacologic treatment, whereas advising about avoidance of pollen exposure may be challenging because of lack of compliance with the 5/8 https://apallergy.org https://doi.org/10.5415/apallergy.2021.11.e16\n"," How did the pandemic affect seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms? measures during pollen season [4, 6] . Since the pollen season coincided with the COVID-19 outbreak this year, recommendations, such as wearing a face mask when going out, taking a shower on return home, and spending less time outdoors during the peak pollen periods have been spontaneously implemented [11] . Accordingly, with the strict quarantine measures, people mostly stayed at home, especially in April and May 2020 [12] . This study revealed that the number of days worked in the office decreased among the employed subjects, but with the start of the normalization period in June, the proportion of working days and the time spent outdoors increased. In line with this finding, subjects were less symptomatic in May 2020 when the grass pollen peak was seen than in June 2020. This data shows us that, spending less time outside during the pollen season is an effective preventive measure.\n"," Patients with pollen allergy are adviced to spend less time outdoors, wear a face mask when going out, and take a shower when they return home in the spring [4, 6, 9, 13, 14] . There are very few studies evaluating the clinical effectiveness of preventive measures in the literature. One of them is about the use of face mask in nurses during COVID-19 pandemic which revealed that face mask may reduce allergic rhinitis symptom severity in chronically affected individuals with intermittent allergic rhinitis. The study supports the hypothesis that face masks may reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis [15] . Another study investigated the efficacy of wearing eyeglasses showed that it was effective in controlling symptoms, improving the quality of life, and reducing the need for medicine in patients with seasonal allerjic rhinitis [16] . In our study, we evaluated the protective effect of spending less time outdoors, wearing a face mask, and taking a shower on return home in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and asthma. The rate of wearing a face mask outdoors and taking a shower was quite low last year; but with the strict precautions taken this year, it was seen that almost all of the patients wore a face mask, and half of them said that they were taking a shower on return home this year. Furthermore, people spent less time outdoors during 2020 pollen season. About three-quarters of the subjects stated that, they had less or almost similar rate of symptoms this year compared to previous year. Taken together, patients with pollen allergy were less symptomatic this year, pointing to the importance of the prevention measures. Almost two-thirds of the participants of this study were employed and the rate of active working subjects decreased significantly during the pandemic compared to 2019. However, there have been some variations in terms of active working during COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, the proportion of active workers have been increased with the normalization phase in June 2020. This study revealed that the group who described lesser symptoms than the previous year were the ones who had much greater reduction in the percentage of active working days compared with individuals who reported the same or worse symptoms this year. Moreover, subjects who reported being less symptomatic this year had a much greater reduction in the percentage of actively working days during the period with strict rules compared to the normalization phase. These findings once again showed that staying at home for whatever the reason was, reduces the exposure to pollens and leads to lesser symptoms even in the pollen peak period.\n"," There are some limitations of the study. First of all, this was a questionnaire study based on subjective measures. If symptom and medication scores were used, the evaluation could be more objective. However, the study population included the registered patients in the outpatient clinic and they are frequently asked for self-evaluation of their symptoms. Because of that, they could express the difference in symptoms very precisely for each month during the pollen season. Secondly, although the answers given to the questions about the 3 months of this year are considered to be reliable, the comparison made with the same period of last year was based on memory and reasoning abilities of the people and was inevitably subjective.\n","Score: 6.6576298038198924\n","\n","Title: Snowbirds and infection-new phenomena in pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations from winter migration of older adults: A spatiotemporal analysis\n","Body Text: synchrony and latitudinal gradients in epidemic peaks [7] . The timing of the seasonal peak in influenza changes annually, ranging from 24 th to 33 rd Julian calendar day [3] . Together, space and timing of the seasonal peak work in synchrony to dictate the epidemiological effects of influenza in the population [8] . The severity of influenza also varies by individual influenza season [9] .\n"," Accurate monitoring and estimation of influenza activity require understanding not only influenza dynamics, but also population characteristics and their changes. Important dynamic factors such as the transmissibility of influenza strains, the accuracy of contact rate assessment, and the movement of populations within and between geographical units, if not clearly understood and properly modelled, may compromise the precision and accuracy of the estimation. The SARS epidemic of 2003 [10] illustrates these complexities by demonstrating the potential of global travel patterns to impact the spread of a virulent infectious agent, the coronavirus, necessitating a systematic investigation on how travel and migration patterns affect disease epidemics.\n"," Although some historical influenza epidemics and pandemics disproportionately affect the younger population, such as the 1918 Spanish influenza [11] and the recent H1N1 pandemic of 2009 [12] , for most seasonal influenza, the elderly (defined as the population aged 65 and above) are the most severely affected. From 1990 to 1998, over 90% of influenza-associated mortality occurred in the elderly, much of which from influenzaassociated pneumonia co-infection. Influenza-associated morbidity is highest in the elderly. Patients with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia accounted for nearly 700,000 average annual hospitalizations from 1998 to 2002. There were over 1.2 million hospitalizations in the elderly with any-listed diagnosis of pneumonia during that period [13] .\n"," The elderly, who experience the most severe morbidity and highest mortality from influenza, are also one of the most mobile population groups due to their frequent seasonal migrations. Popular destinations in the U.S. include Florida, Arizona, and Texas. These migrations can be sizable: in 2005, the proportion of non-permanent elderly residents increases from 0.5% in September (summer time in the US) to 12.1% in January [14] . Unlike younger populations who may travel temporarily for work and leisure, the elderly tend to stay for longer periods of time and use more health services [15] . These migrations may affect influenza transmission and, as a consequence, change health care service utilization patterns both at their home state and in their temporary residence or lodging [14] . Evidence suggests that hospitalization patterns for in-state residents differ from temporary residents [16] . This has important implications, not only by potentially affecting the dynamics and transmission patterns of influenza itself, but also by impacting health care service providers. Peak seasonal migration to Florida and other southern states coincides with the typical peak in influenza, which generally occurs in the winter months [3, 14] . There are few studies that have assessed differences in patterns of influenza-related hospitalization in the Medicare population simultaneously by time of year, provider state, and state of residence.\n"," The purpose of this analysis is to quantify these spatiotemporal patterns in influenza-associated hospitalizations in the elderly using Medicare-associated hospitalization claims in the United States for 16 years, including 15 complete influenza seasons (July 1991-June 2006). We compare spatiotemporal patterns of influenza activity across all states of the U.S., emphasizing the simultaneous comparison of seasonal migration patterns by season. We then focus the analysis on Florida, a state known for extensive seasonal migration of elderly adults, to examine how seasonal migration to Florida affects the timing, geography, and intensity of pneumonia and influenza across seasons.\n"," We abstracted 21.5 million out of 229.7 million hospitalization records obtained from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) based on a set of previously established entry criteria [3] : admission happened from 1991 through 2006, patient's age was 65 or above when admitted, and the patient's diagnoses includes pneumonia and influenza (P&I; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 480-487). Variables used in this analysis are patient's age, date of admission, state of residence, and state in which the patient was hospitalized, referred to as \"provider state\" hereafter. For the national state-level analysis, we compiled cumulative frequencies of the P&I hospitalization in two time periods-October 1 st through March 31 st and April 1 st through September 30 th -approximating the in-and off-seasons. For the analysis on Florida, we created a 5884-day-long time series by compiling daily counts of the P&I hospitalization for Floridians and non-Floridians.\n"," The first part of the analysis assessed the spatiotemporal patterns of influenza-associated hospitalizations for all 50 states plus the District of Columbia by comparing the ratios of hospitalized residents to hospitalized nonresidents between the two time periods with χ 2 tests. To better explore the relative changes in rates and counts of P&I hospitalizations in specific state of residence and provider state, we visualized these multivariate relationship using bubble matrix plots [17] . As an extension of the aforementioned χ 2 analysis, a second bubble matrix was made to show the natural log transformed ratio of the number of non-Floridians to the number of Floridians for each combination of the provider states and states of residence.\n"," The second part of the analysis focused on understanding the residential makeup and temporal fluctuation of the elderly hospitalized in Florida. Demographic characteristics of the two groups (Floridian vs. Non-Floridian) were compared with t-test and χ 2 test. The original states of residence of the non-Floridian were tabulated. The counts were then segregated by the two periods of time for calculating the seasonal ratios (frequency of hospitalizations in April-September divided by frequency of hospitalizations in October-March). The resultant ratios were visualized using mapping.\n"," To understand the temporal differences between the two residential groups, time-series plots were created illustrating the change in the hospitalization counts between the two groups. We then used harmonic regression to estimate the times to peak for each group, controlled for long-term trends. The general equation of the harmonic regression is as follows:\n"," ln[E(Counts)] = β 0 + β 1 sin(2π t) + β 2 cos(2π t) + β 3 (t) + β 4 (t 2 ), where ln[E(Counts)] are hospitalization counts modelled with Poisson distribution, π is the constant, ω is the frequency, and t is the day in a time series ranging from 1 st to 5884 th day. The terms β 3 (t) and β 4 (t 2 ) control for longterm linear and quadratic trends. The coefficients β 1 and β 2 are needed to derive peak timing in days. Detailed methods can be found elsewhere [18] . SAS version 9.0 (Cary, NC) and S-PLUS version 8 (Palo Alto, CA) were used for the data abstraction and analysis, respectively. ArcGIS version 9.3 (Redlands, CA) was used for mapping. The Tufts Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol for this analysis of the CMS data.\n"," For the majority of states, a significantly higher proportion of non-resident P&I hospitalizations occurred from April-September than from October-March (Table 1) . Significantly higher proportions of non-resident P&I hospitalizations occurred from October-March than in April-September in a minority of states-Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, South Carolina, and Texas.\n"," Examining the non-resident P&I hospitalizations, we observe uneven patterns in the distribution of state of residence. Figure 1 depicts a bubble plot of the crossclassification of provider state and state of residence for all P&I cases from 1991 through 2006 from October through March. The size of the bubble represents frequencies of hospitalization and the hue represents rates. Information in the diagonal cells was omitted because those cells would be of much higher counts and rates, which is natural because most people are hospitalized in their own state, dwarfing the small but important distinctions among the discordant cells.\n"," Residents of certain states have a greater propensity to be treated out-of-state for P&I than many other states. Non-residents of states such as California, Arizona, Florida, and Texas comprise a notable proportion of the total P&I hospitalizations treated in hospitals in these states. States are displayed alphabetically within Census divisions. In general, adjacent groups of states tend to have the largest discordances between provider state and state of residence for P&I cases. This is especially evident in several New England states, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, as well as many residents of Alabama being treated in neighbouring Georgia and Florida, and vice versa.\n"," There were notable similarities and differences between the typical high season for influenza-October through March-compared to the period of time between April and September, which generally has lower rates of disease. Figure 2 depicts the ratio of P&I hospitalizations comparing counts from October to March to counts from April to September, by provider state and state of residence. Orange dots represent states in which the rates are higher for October-March than for April-September. Blue dots represent states in which P&I rates are higher for April-September than for October-March. Higher colour saturations represent rate ratios of higher magnitude. Certain states, such as Hawaii, Arizona, Texas, and Florida show higher rates of non-resident P&I hospitalizations in October-March than for the time period of April-September for most states. The non-resident P&I cases in Arizona appear to come from a fairly even distribution of many other states. In contrast, out-of-state residents being hospitalized in Florida for P&I were derived primarily from northeastern, and Midwestern states. Many northern states had the opposite pattern entirely: the northernmost states-including Maine, Vermont, North Dakota, and Montana and others-actually experienced decreases in out-of-state resident P&I hospitalizations during the influenza season compared to the off-season. Table 2 .\n"," A closer examination of the specific states from which the non-resident P&I cases hospitalized in Florida reveals that a large proportion of those individuals are residents of Northeast and Midwestern states ( Table 3) . The top six states provided the majority (53.7%) of all out-of-state cases: New York, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Georgia. The two states that share a border with Florida, Georgia and Alabama, provide 8.6% of all non-resident P&I cases. Furthermore, the mapping of the seasonal ratios (frequency in April-September/frequency in October-March) of non-Floridians hospitalized in Florida reveals a distinct spatial pattern ( Figure 3 ). States shaded in purple provide more non-resident P&I hospitalizations to Florida during between October and March than between April and September. The darker the hue, the greater the difference is between October-March and April-September. In states shaded in green-namely California, Nevada, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, Hawaii, and Florida itself, there were more non-resident P&I cases occurring in Florida during April-September than between October and March.\n"," Examining all P&I cases occurring in Florida comparing residents to nonresidents, we observed distinct seasonality in the numbers of P&I hospitalizations attributable to out-of-state residents but who sought care in Florida (Figure 4 ). This graph illustrates the seasonal peaks in weekly counts of both the resident and nonresident P&I hospitalizations in Florida. There is also distinct seasonality in the percent of all P&I hospitalizations attributable to non-Florida residents. This percentage oscillated between approximately 4% during the seasonal nadirs in the summer months to 13% during the typical wintertime increases. According to the results of the harmonic regression, hospitalizations of the out-of-state patients peaked at about the third week of January, which is about one week later than that of the same-state patients (28 th ±0.005 Julian calendar day vs. 23 rd ±0.005, p < 0.001).\n"," We found distinct, state-specific hospitalization patterns that differ across provider states and over time. In several states, such as California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida, among others, the proportion of non-residents being hospitalized for P&I was higher in the winter months than in the summer months, although for most states, the opposite was true. In Florida, the proportion of all P&I hospitalizations attributable to out-of-state residents was over three times as high between October and March compared to the usual nadir of influenza activity, April through September. A large portion of out-of-state resident P&I hospitalizations in Florida are derived from northeastern and Midwestern states, such as New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The patterns observed in Florida are similar to those observed in other destination states for seasonally migrating elderly, including Texas, California, and Arizona, except that the composition of states of primary residence are slightly different than that of Florida.\n"," Furthermore, the top contributors of hospitalized nonresidents are not necessarily with the largest proportions of the national elderly population ( Figure 5 ). Clear discrepancies exist between the proportion of all U.S. elderly living in the state and each state's contribution to non-resident P&I hospitalizations in Florida. Michigan, for example, has the eighth largest population of elderly in the nation, yet the state contributed the second-highest number of P&I cases to the non-resident P&I hospitalizations in Florida. Texas contains the National data on seasonal migration of the elderly within the United States are not readily available. Estimates of seasonal migration are available only through proxies or surveys [14] . Our findings contribute to the body of knowledge into seasonal migration of elderly in two important ways. First, these findings provide a framework to estimate seasonal migratory patterns of the U.S. elderly population at the level of stateto-state transference. Second, these findings highlight the need for adjusting and fine-tuning public health and medical infrastructure necessary to provide critical care for those elderly patients. Public health and medical practitioners could use these findings to identify areas where and time when out-of-state elderly visitors may overwhelm the local infrastructures [19] . Suggested services to be evaluated include vaccination programs, hospital beds, home care services, and medical treatments for complications of P&I, particularly for resident and non-resident elderly, who face the most severe morbidity and highest mortality from these diseases.\n"," Pneumonia and influenza prevention and treatment for elderly has never been more important. As of 2010, the U.S. has 46 million Medicare beneficiaries [20], most of whom are elderly. Exacerbating this situation are the rapid expansions of both size and proportion of the elderly population: As the large Baby Boomer cohort enters the age groups most vulnerable to the effects of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality, the impact of influenza will likely grow precipitously, resulting in an even greater, yet largely preventable strain on the already burdened health care delivery system [21] . A major strength of this analysis is the use of CMS data set, which is one of the most complete (96% coverage [22] ) sources of information on U.S. elderly hospitalization profile. The recorded dates of admission permitted us to estimate the peak time of the outcome to the day level. Other in-depth analyses, such as relationship between hospitalizations with climatic features and holidays, can also be performed [23] .\n"," The analysis has some important limitations, however. First, the data used for the analysis are only a part of all insurance claims, and therefore do not represent the overall burden of P&I in the elderly population. Our cases likely represent only the more severe cases of influenza and its complications. Furthermore, Medicare covers approximately 96% of the elderly population. Therefore, the total number of P&I cases is likely an underestimate of the total P&I burden in the elderly [24] .\n"," Second, we defined the patients with out-of-state residential code as non-permanent residents, but we do not know whether non-residents of each state hospitalized for P&I in that state were living a substantial portion of the year in that particular year, or if they were in the state for a short period. There have been reports on elderly population keeping their original state identity while living in another state for a long term, mostly for tax-related benefits [25] . So, part of the increase in the ratios during winter could have been due to increase in seasonal migrants, while another part could have been due to those long-term stayers who have moved to a warmer place due to their deteriorating health while decided to keep their original state identity. Studies on whether snowbirds have less robust health compared to the national elderly are limited, and the results are inconclusive [26] . In either of the two circumstances, our findings still emphasize the importance to understand more on this non-residential hospitalized elderly population.\n"," Despite the limitations outlined above, our study is among the first to quantify pneumonia and influenza hospitalization patterns in the elderly with respect to seasonal migration in the United States. Information on this seasonal migration patterns and influenza-associated disease patterns in this vulnerable population is critical in preparing for and controlling a potential influenza outbreak. We observed that nearly 15% of all P&I hospitalizations that occurred in Florida in peak influenza months were from patients visiting from another state. Influx of people can profoundly impact the health care system in destination states. The statistically significant delay of five days in the hospitalization peak time for the non-Floridian implies possible differences in susceptibilities or health seeking behaviors between the two groups or time and place of potential exposure to virus. The results of this and future related studies may explicate certain populations to target with public health interventions, such as vaccination, at the appropriate time to maximize effectiveness and reduce the burden of pneumonia and influenza in the elderly. In future intervention studies, seasonally migrating elderly individuals could be universally vaccinated in their state of primary residence before the start of the influenza season to determine if this process could curtail the spread of influenza in their destination state. Additionally, flow mapping with multivariate visualization [27, 28] and network analyses [29] show promise as valuable tools to quantify spatially and temporally how influenza dynamically flows among states to provide the most vulnerable populations the appropriate medical care and preventive measures.\n"," This study simultaneously assessed the spatial and temporal components of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the American elderly population, highlighting the seasonal patterns of influenza potentially related to seasonal migration of elderly individuals. Given the lack of national data on inter-state seasonal migration, we demonstrated the use of Medicare hospitalizations to quantify the impact of seasonal or temporary migration patterns on the distribution of pneumonia and influenza in the United States. Understanding where, when, and to whom hospitalizations occur is a critical component to predict, contain, or even prevent the spread of influenza to the vulnerable population of elderly adults, and will allow state and local health officials to plan for localized outbreaks and timely changes in health care services utilization.\n","Score:

remotely engaging groups in quality improvement\n","Body Text: Summary: These principles represent a novel conceptualization of virtual external implementation facilitation, giving structure to a process that has been, to date, inadequately described. The associated actions are demonstrably useful in supporting the principles and offer teams interested in virtual external implementation facilitation concrete methods by which to ensure success. Our examples stem from experiences in healthcare. But the principles can, in theory, be applied to virtual external implementation facilitation regardless of setting, as they and the associated actions are not setting specific.\n"," Keywords: Implementation facilitation, External facilitation, Virtual, Methods, Quality improvement, Remote, Strategies\n"," Contributions to the literature Supporting implementation of evidence-based interventions through virtual external facilitation offers opportunities to extend implementation activities' reach.\n"," We developed a set of principles for successful virtual external implementation facilitation based on our experience supporting a national quality improvement program.\n"," Overarching principles are pilot everything, incorporate a model, and prioritize metacognition. Practical principles are plan in advance, communicate in real-time, build relationships, engage participants, and construct a virtual room.\n"," We give examples of how to enact practical principles to promote success.\n"," Facilitation is considered a \"core ingredient\" for successful implementation of evidence-based practices and innovations in complex clinical programs [1] . A facilitation implementation strategy comprises a role (facilitator) and a multi-faceted set of actions (interactive problemsolving and provision of interpersonal support) with individuals, groups, and organizations to enable adoption of innovations into routine practice in the context of a quality improvement (QI) process or implementation study [2] . Facilitation aims to create a supportive environment that enables facilitators and innovation stakeholders to exchange knowledge, identify barriers to implementation, and develop processes to overcome those barriers [3] . Because implementation facilitation relies on continuous relationship-and skill-building, it usually involves a blend of in-person and virtual interactions [4] .\n"," External facilitation refers specifically to the role individuals outside an organization have in helping those within the organization implement evidence-based interventions into routine practice. External facilitation has multiple purposes: identifying and resolving problems, communicating, and building and supporting the relationship between the organization and the researchers [5] . Identifying and resolving problems can involve, among other things, identifying barriers, sharing viable solutions and options, helping set realistic goals, and providing networks of peer sites. Communicating may mean providing regular contact and information, monitoring data and possible solutions for problems, and establishing links among sites. And relationship building and support includes providing reassurance, encouragement, empowerment, and mentorship.\n"," Virtual external implementation facilitation is important for implementation studies and programs. Virtual interactions may expand the public health impact of successful interventions [6] by enabling a wider reach than in-person only interactions. Studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, support the potentially greater reach of fully virtual programs [7, 8] . Emergent public health situations may also necessitate transition from in-person to virtual interactions. The COVID-19 pandemic and consequent implementation of social distancing guidelines forced many educational endeavors, laboratories, and non-COVID-19 research efforts either to quickly transition to remote interactions or else temporarily halt their activities [9] [10] [11] . Under these conditions, virtual facilitation offered opportunities for teams to remain connected, adapt their plans, and continue their work [12, 13] . In-person facilitation also frequently requires resources (personnel, time) that may be cost-prohibitive. Compared to in-person interactions, virtual team engagement involves fewer travel-related costs, enables more flexible scheduling, may result in greater likelihood of stakeholder attendance and fewer disruptions to clinical responsibilities, and can enhance tracking and archiving of facilitation activities [14] . Taken together, these reasons offer a compelling case for external facilitation implementation to proactively consider how best to leverage advances in teleconferencing and videoconferencing technology.\n"," Our team has extensive experience in virtual external implementation facilitation. In 2017, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care created a national QI program for VA's 134 nursing homes (Community Living Centers, CLCs). The CLCs' Ongoing National Center for Enhancing Resources and Training (CONCERT) supports CLCs in implementing evidence-based practices for QI [15] . CONCERT, guided by the principles of relational coordination and person-centered care [16] [17] [18] , aids CLCs in shifting from a quality assurance approach (focusing on remedial actions and retrospective data) to one of high-involvement performance improvement (all staff and managers involved in a prospective, preventative, evidence-based approach to care). Since 2018, CONCERT has held successful 6-to 9-month long learning collaboratives to help CLCs implement evidence-based practices.\n"," We conducted these collaboratives using blended facilitation. Facilitators internal to each site (a 4-person leadership team) worked with external facilitators (members of the CONCERT team). The collaboratives involved interacting with eight CLCs (August 2018 to April 2019; mixture of in-person plus virtual external facilitation), thirty-one CLCs (April 2019 to August 2019; exclusively virtual external facilitation), and ninety-five CLCs (January 2020 to April 2021; in-person facilitation in January 2020 and virtual external facilitation thereafter). External facilitation consisted of facilitating multiday learning sessions, conducting site-level consultations, conducting individual site as well as group-level coaching, conducting interactive webinars, and communicating with and across sites through phone calls, email, office hours, newsletters, and a web-based site. Internal facilitation was exclusively in-person until the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, after which it varied by site but remained mostly in-person.\n"," During the learning intensives, our team used a continual QI process. During multi-day learning sessions and site visits, we met daily to debrief, to learn from that day's successes and challenges and improve the next. We also met weekly as a team; each meeting included a facilitation update and problem-solving time to harness the power of the team to solve facilitation issues. As of April 2020, we began an additional, weekly, 2h facilitator development training, in which the team, led by expert consultants, focused exclusively on honing their facilitation skills. In preparation for this paper, we reviewed the extensive written record of these various team meetings and met iteratively as a team to condense what we learned. Based on this, we provide the following recommendations for enabling successful larger-scale virtual implementation facilitation with groups.\n"," Many principles that are critical to successful virtual implementation are also important in any implementation facilitation effort. External facilitators have traditionally often done some of their work virtually. But because a completely virtual environment means people are never in close physical proximity, in our experience, virtual external implementation facilitation requires special consideration beyond and different from in-person external implementation facilitation. Below, we describe three overarching principles of virtual external implementation facilitation: pilot everything, incorporate a model, and prioritize metacognition. We also describe five practical principlesplan in advance, communicate in real time, build relationships, engage participants, and construct a \"room\"-and how to enact these.\n"," Key to virtual external implementation facilitation success is a continuous QI mindset. Because operating virtually means you are often navigating unfamiliar territory, it is important to start small and use plan-dostudy-act cycles to continually refine your processes. To this end, external facilitation team members should take the approach that all applications of the practical principles below are pilot projects that the team studies, discusses, and modifies to try to improve. Holding regular facilitation-team debriefs and trainings are crucial components of this process. To help gain objective feedback, it helps to assign some team members roles as outside observers, where they step outside their team roles during certain portions of the external facilitation experience (such as shadowing on calls or being note-taker during a larger learning session) to observe and provide objective input during the team debrief.\n"," A model can help guide your virtual external implementation facilitation process by providing clear goals. In our national work, we followed the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's breakthrough series model [19] . This model emphasizes the importance of the external facilitators in bringing implementation-site participants together in iterative cycles to learn about a focused topic, facilitating these participants' developing action plans, and supporting their implementing the action plans in their local environments, including helping identify and resolve problems. In our work, this model helped focus the actions we took to enact the practical principles below. The model, for example, reminded us to always emphasize the importance of the participants' learning from peers as well as recognized experts. And its emphasis on continuous QI as the participants implement the evidence-based practice necessitated our also continually improving our communication and support mechanisms. The breakthrough series model is only one example; external facilitators should incorporate the model that fits their work best.\n"," Adults learn new information best when they quickly have opportunities to apply it and those opportunities are coupled with speaking or writing about what happened when they applied it and with reflecting on what they will do when applying it next [20] [21] [22] . This thinking process is called metacognition. By incorporating structured opportunities for both external facilitators and participants to have metacognitive experiences, preferably by talking in groups, information about the new material is encoded into their long-term memories, making them more likely to act on it at their next opportunity [23] [24] [25] . This enables both external facilitators and participants to continually improve. An example of how we enacted this principle was by conducting immediate, daily, external facilitator debriefs after any prolonged facilitation efforts with participants (e.g., after a learning session or a site visit).\n"," Advance planning is critical to the success of any external implementation facilitation endeavor. But virtual situations require additional planning to compensate for the lack of ability to work together quickly onsite to compensate for the unexpected. In an in-person environment, if a piece of technology fails or a presenter shows up late, for example, facilitators can avail themselves of numerous impromptu ways to hold participants' attention. These scenarios play out differently when people do not share the same physical space. Planning ahead for virtual external implementation facilitation, therefore, requires not only preparing for how you would like things to proceed under ideal conditions but also planning for failure and how to avoid or deal with the many things that can go wrong.\n"," Communication is key to external facilitation. In a virtual situation, external facilitators are likely not in the same location as the participants. In the case of external facilitation endeavors that involve multiple external facilitators simultaneously, external facilitators may also not be in the same location as each other. In addition, virtual communication may or may not involve video. Communication in these situations, therefore, involves more than would be required in a room where people can talk or gesture to one another. External facilitators must prepare to meet participants at the participants' virtual communication comfort level. For scheduled interactions, external facilitators should develop a communication mechanism that enables real-time trouble shooting. This may mean keeping an eye on email or messaging platforms when holding a support call, so anyone with technical difficulties can inform facilitators. Many virtual meeting platforms enable behind-the-scenes communication. When there are multiple facilitators for a training, for example, facilitators benefit from practicing with these and other rapid communication mechanisms such as group text messaging to ensure they can inform, trouble shoot, and brainstorm in real time to support participants.\n"," A virtual environment increases the danger that relationship-building among participants and between participants and external facilitators may be more difficult or may not happen as quickly or as well as in an inperson environment. Participants, for example, cannot turn to the person next to them at a table; external facilitators cannot walk around the room or-if there is no video or there are multiple people on a video call-read non-verbal cues. For external facilitators, it is also much more difficult to gauge the \"temperature\" of a room and react accordingly to increase or modify the level or type of support. Virtual external implementation facilitators must consequently be more consistently vigilant about generating opportunities to develop and support relationships among and with participants. This may mean working with participants to pilot different options, finding the best fit for particular circumstances; creating deliberate, regular opportunities for participant feedback; and individualizing and tailoring external facilitation approaches more than might be required under in-person conditions.\n"," Participant engagement in a virtual environment also poses particular challenges from an external facilitation perspective, because participants may experience competing demands for their time that they would not experience if interactions with facilitators were in person. Without the peer pressure of a physically communal activity and with the added pressures of one's local environment and multitasking temptations or requirements, it is also easier for participants to disengage partially or completely. And in a completely virtual environment, facilitators may not be immediately aware of such disengagement when it occurs. Knowing that participants may be distracted at some points, it is critical to include presentation slides that clearly spell out the teaching points at multiple locations in the presentation so that if a participant is distracted for a short period, they will be able to catch up. Building in and enacting specific techniques aimed at fostering participant engagement throughout the virtual external implementation experience-such as more frequent but shorter duration check-ins, participating in regularly scheduled meetings at the participant's site instead of relying only on separate facilitation meetings, multiplying contact options, or creating brief but meaningful newsletters or important topic webinars-is thus critical to success.\n"," Precisely because no actual room exists in a virtual environment, it is critical that participants feel a sense of being together in a virtual space with both their peers and the external facilitators. External facilitators must therefore use specific methods to create opportunities for supporting these needs by recognizing and taking advantage of opportunities virtual environments afford, such as using logos and other branding, building togetherness by acknowledging who is participating, and systematically calling on participants so everyone's voice is heard.\n"," Enacting the practical principles described above is possible when external facilitators take multiple actions. We describe these below. Table 1 augments these descriptions by using example illustrations from our national work.\n"," Successful virtual external implementation facilitation requires having clear roles that both facilitation team members and participants recognize and understand. Key among these roles is that of the greeter. A greeter is an identified external facilitation team member who greets everyone who enters a virtual room and who keeps the conversation flowing until the formal agenda begins. The greeter needs to know who will join the meeting (both participants and presenters), who will facilitate the agenda, and the timing of various aspects of the meeting. The greeter should always be the first person to enter the virtual room, so they can identify and interact with participants as they join, welcoming them and assuring them they are in the right place. If possible, the greeter should be on screen or speaking over a placeholder slide with the program name or agenda and start time. The greeter sets the first tone, which should be upbeat and friendly. Greeters should ensure there is no extended silence as everyone waits for the meeting to begin, instead immediately engaging participants. Ahead of time, the greeter should prepare a list of questions to ask, topics about which to chat with participants, or topical information to share. Greeters should also keep the perspective of the newly entering participant in mind. If the greeter is working a virtual room with many participants, every 60 seconds or so, they should clearly identify what they are doing, e.g., \"If you are just coming on, welcome. We will begin at the top of the hour. I'm Sharon, and I'm here to welcome you. If you are having any technical difficulties, here are some troubleshooting resources.\" If people cannot see each other, when new participants join, the greeter should always identify who is already in the meeting in as much detail as possible, creating a sense of a virtual room. If attendance is expected or mandatory, the greeter should check off participants as they join and, behind the scenes, alert other team members to reach out to those who have not joined the meeting by the start time, to ensure they have the proper information needed to connect or help with technical difficulties.\n"," When the meeting begins, the greeter announces publicly who is in the meeting (or shares some other metric of attendance) and introduces the external facilitator and any internal facilitators (facilitators who are located at the sites). In addition to their main role of engaging with and helping participants implement the intervention, the facilitators introduce topics, announce transitions, and continually orient participants to where the program stands regarding the agenda. They remain flexible, supporting participant input, and delegate troubleshooting tasks to other team members. Because participants' first and final impressions of any interactions are important, facilitators should prepare and rehearse the main portions of their role, including opening and closing remarks and how they will react if unanticipated challenges arise. Their goal is to engage the participants and remain calm if things do not go according to plan.\n"," External facilitation team members should also take responsibility for other roles to keep the virtual activities flowing smoothly. This works best if team members have opportunities to practice the roles ahead of time. The following is a selection of important roles that apply in various situations; a team member can have more than one role.\n"," shows if attendance is mandatory and keeps a database for monitoring the facilitation's reach) 2. Recording manager (starts and stops the recording if the interaction will be recorded) 3. Chat box moderator (moderates and monitors the chat box or other communication mechanism and informs the facilitator(s) if there are issues or questions that need to be addressed) 4. Presentation moderator (shares screens and advances slides) 5. Technical trouble shooter (helps team members and participants with technical connection or other issues)\n"," Video and audio conference platforms usually enable a private chat feature but may not support a sub-group chat. Consider creating a group chat via cell phone for members of the external and internal facilitation teams. Example: The greeter should welcome participants and avoid awkward silences while participants are gathering (e.g., \"Good morning, this is Ryann from the CONCERT team. The program will start in just a few minutes. In the meantime, please type your name and location in the chat box.\"). Once the program starts, the greeter hands off to a second team member who facilitates the content of the meeting. While the content facilitator directs the program, another team member troubleshoots individual technical issues and/ or manages chat boxes.\n"," Create small cohorts If there are a large number of participants, deliberately separate participants into smaller groups (organized by facility, location, role, any other relevant characteristic) to enable engagement, sharing, and encourage more meaningful interactions. It may be important to construct smaller groups that avoid hierarchical dilemmas (e.g., separating senior leaders from frontline staff for potentially volatile or personal conversations or mixing sites so supervisors are not in the same group as their own supervisees). Example: During the completely virtual external facilitation collaborative the 31 participating CLCs (> 120 individual participants) were separated into 3 cohorts for the duration of the collaborative. During a multi-day learning session cohort 1 (n = 10 CLCs,~40 individual participants) was further divided into 3 smaller breakout groups. During the learning session, the 3 small groups each participated in separate online breakout sessions to discuss performance improvement projects they had implement in their individual CLCs. External facilitators present at each breakout session facilitated discussion across participants, enabling them to highlight their keys to success and other lessons learned. This facilitated discussion was used to help build Power-Point storyboards for each small group to present during the next segment of the learning session. All small group assignments and connection information for the breakout session were included in the agenda, which was sent to all participants prior to the start of the learning session.\n"," Provide clarity and structure for interactions with/among participants Explicitly outline for the participants who will be serving in the various facilitation roles. Example: The attendance monitor and facilitator contacts no-shows if attendance is mandatory and keeps a database for monitoring the facilitation's reach. The recording manager starts and stops the recording if the interaction will be recorded. The chat box moderator monitors the chat box or other communication mechanism and informs the facilitator(s) if there are issues or questions that need to be addressed. The presentation moderator shares screens and advances slides. The technical trouble shooter helps team members and participants with technical connection or other issues.\n"," Providing structure for the program's content ensures participants all have similar experiences and focus on the program's content. Example: Create a structured action plan that reinforces learning objectives for participants by guiding them through the plan in a stepwise fashion offline. We provide an example of a templated action plan as an online supplement.\n"," Adding visual components to an audio presentation will enhance participant engagement and keep their attention. Be succinct and use graphics to help convey your message. Example: Construct PowerPoint slides with less text and more content-related graphics. If presenting a PowerPoint or other slides, write the important points in the notes section and keep your audience's attention by having few words on the slides. Before breakout sessions, share a summary slide to remind participants about key issues and guide small group discussion. These bulleted talking points (e.g., please discuss the following: (1) your lessons learned, (2) what you will do differently now that you have learned this new information, (3) how you will take this forward) help participants share their experiences and learn from others.\n"," Create time in the agenda for participants to immediately apply learned knowledge in their local setting. Give participants a relatively simple task and reconvene the virtual group to discuss how it went and how to move forward. Example: Following a virtual presentation about how to implement a new quality improvement activity, participants from each team are given an hour to practice the activity together locally. Participants then return to the online platform to discuss how the activity went and create action plans for implementing the activity more broadly in their local site.\n"," Have a plan in place in case there are issues with technology and be sure to have a way to communicate with your team outside of the online platform. Example: The external facilitation team connects to the online platform to practice delivering the evidencebased implementation content, with assigned team roles in place. Technical difficulties are identified, so the team decides to create a text message group to use the day of the event. This enables the team members to reach each other about technical difficulties or suggestions in real time during the virtual presentation.\n"," Engage everyone Facilitators should invite each participant into conversations (via audio or chat), being mindful of group dynamics and continually focusing on collaborative subjects. Example: Conduct round robin check-ins during audio sessions in which all participants take turns sharing their experiences. Round robin sharing sessions can then transition to facilitated discussions in which participants and facilitators help each other brainstorm challenges and next steps.\n"," This has the advantage of not being dependent on any one platform's functionality and enables alerts and problem-solving conversations to occur behind the scenes.\n"," If the participants number more than a dozen individuals, having meaningful interaction as a large group during the virtual implementation facilitation becomes difficult. Breaking the larger group into smaller facilitated cohorts that meet separately during selected portions of a meeting overcomes this challenge. It enables meaningful sharing among participants and enables them to set their own agenda items more easily. One way to do this is to randomly assign participants behind the scenes. Alternatively, a deliberate, ahead-of-time purposive division into groups based on known relevant characteristics may also increase diversity during meaningful interactions. To promote richer, more inclusive discussions, the external facilitation team can help construct these smaller groups with the participants themselves and/or any internal facilitators. It is critical that participants have a clear plan and supporting materials for the small groups before separation from a larger group. External facilitators can work with sites to create downloadable or sent-ahead-of-time handouts with exercises, roles, time limits, and troubleshooting information. Consider showing the small group instructions with screen sharing and walking participants through the instructions before sending them to the small groups, no matter how clear your supporting materials may be. And always allow for questions if members get confused. Participants should also have a way to reach an identified facilitation team member(s) in case of trouble. Some platforms do not have clear ways of calling for help. Clarify for participants how they will get help if they get in their breakout groups and they are confused.\n"," Having smaller groups work together can foster a sense of community and collaboration among participants. They can help each other as peers, coaching one another through the application of what they have learned, focusing on each participant's strengths. Sharing experiences also helps reinforce concepts and techniques.\n"," The first interaction of participants with a program is often through an initial agenda distributed ahead of time, constructed either by external facilitators or, ideally, by external and internal facilitators and participants working together. This agenda should be clear to a naïve reader. Icons or other visuals can be used to identify repeated actions or clarify the contents of longer agendas that may otherwise overwhelm participants with too much text. In addition to presenting information about content, the agenda should also set expectations for participant interaction and engagement.\n"," As indicated above, facilitators can provide structure to meetings. At the beginning of the meeting, the facilitator can state the mutually understood objectives and support the participants in meeting those objectives throughout. At the end of the meeting, the facilitator can provide closure by recapping what the facilitation team and the participants will each do as next steps. The external facilitator can also provide structure by ensuring the meeting adheres to its schedule. If urgent issues arise during the session, the external facilitator can indicate the facilitation team will follow up, change future sessions, or adjust the remaining agenda items. If changes to the meeting time need to be made, make them during a break for the participants and keep the meeting and meeting section start and end times the same, as participants have likely structured their schedules around these times.\n"," Structuring as much as is feasible will help ensure core intervention components are described, reinforced, and implemented. Having structured handouts and notes templates for exercises or other participant experiences help participants understand the evidence-based implementation's goals, focus their efforts, and share information with fellow participants or others. They give participants tools to capture meaningful data and information and help participants with the hands-on application of knowledge they have gained. To the extent it is desirable, they also ensure all participants have similar experiences. Example structured content includes action plans, report back templates, and train-the-trainer tools. For these, the visuals and graphics should be the same as those used in any program presentations, so participants can easily match program content to the structured content. Ideally, structured exercises and experiences will be created in a collaborative effort between external and internal facilitators, as internal facilitators have the greatest sense of what will work best for participants from their sites.\n"," Visuals provide an important supplement to audio interactions. Visuals give participants another way to learn and engage. In advance of a meeting, for example, it can be helpful to send participants documents for review and input. The visuals in these documents should be clear and designed to orient participants. Draw attention to key pieces of information using color, bolding, highlighting, shapes, or call-out boxes. The goal is to create cognitive ease for participants [26] . External facilitators should think about what is needed to convey implementation-relevant content in a clear, engaging, and succinct way and work with internal facilitators and participants to tailor and adapt materials to site needs. Always pilot test visuals with naïve users or internal facilitators before sending to participants or using in a presentation. What seems meaningful to external facilitators who understand the content may not be meaningful to participants for whom the content is new [27, 28] .\n"," If possible, it is helpful to build time directly into the virtual external facilitation agenda for participants to immediately apply knowledge gained during an interaction. Collaborate with internal facilitators and/or participants to review agendas for potential activity opportunitieslook for areas where it is important to reinforce a concept or technique important for the evidence-based practice implementation. In those places, build an activity that participants can do at their own sites. This should be a relatively simple task and easy for participants to do without much logistical effort or preplanning (although some pre-planning can be expected if participants are notified of the expectation well in advance of the meeting). Incorporate time in the agenda for participants to do the activity at their site and for them to debrief in smaller cohorts. This way they both gain the applied experience and have the metacognitive experience that comes with discussing it with others.\n"," External implementation facilitation involves being nimble. Interactions with sites and participants may go differently than expected. Issues that may arise include challenges with engaging participants, problems connecting to conferencing platform, and key participants being suddenly absent for unexpected reasons. External facilitators can ensure participants will have the best interaction possible and that the interactions meet the intended goal of the activities by creating backup plans in collaboration with internal facilitators or key participants. If participants are silent or disengaged, for example, have an easy-to-answer set of questions ready. If the video platform does not work, make sure everyone knows a backup conference phone number. If an interaction is planned to be especially large, long, or complex, create a checklist [29] . Having backup plans whenever possible will enable the best use of limited virtual interactions with participants.\n"," Participant engagement is critical for successful virtual external implementation facilitation. The external facilitation team should deliberately invite each participant into the conversation. This is why group size is critical and groups where participants number over a dozen should be broken down into smaller cohorts with separate external facilitators. When having a conversation with participants, whether the conversation is in writing (chat box) or by voice, external and/or internal facilitators should acknowledge off topic comments for later discussion and, when necessary, redirect the conversation to ensure opportunities for all to participate. Having an attendee list helps in this regard, particularly for keeping track of who has spoken and being able to call on people by name or group.\n"," During this process, external facilitators need to be mindful of group dynamics and traditional hierarchical structures, which is why collaborating with internal facilitators is so important. Groups may have leaders and supervisors in them as well as other staff, potentially making it more difficult for staff to speak openly. In such cases, it is best to begin with collaborative subjects and redirect any conversation towards collaboration and group strengths. If certain participants are overpowering or monopolizing the conversation, acknowledge their point, if appropriate, and pull in those who are quiet by calling on them directly to contribute their opinions. Ultimately, try to model and create a safe space for all to contribute, to maximize the impact of the external facilitation.\n"," The overarching and practical principles described here represent a novel conceptualization of virtual external implementation facilitation that gives a practical structure to a process that heretofore in the literature has been inadequately described. The associated actions we describe are demonstrably useful techniques for supporting the principles and offer teams that are interested in virtual external implementation facilitation concrete methods by which to ensure success. Our examples stem from our experiences in using the principles in healthcare. But they can, in principle, be applied to virtual external implementation facilitation, regardless of setting, as the principles and actions are not setting specific. We encourage broad use of the principles and actions to harness the power that virtual methods can bring to external implementation facilitation.\n","Score: 1.5406198698206406\n","\n","Title: A Brave New World: Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality in Systems Biology HHS Public Access\n","Body Text: Oculus Rift (Menlo Park, CA), HTC VIVE (Taiwan), and PlayStation VR (San Mateo, CA), have enabled VR to finally have good enough performance at relatively cheaper prices, creating a positive feedback loop between companies that develop more advanced technologies and expanding consumer demand, which led to a tremendous jump in VR technology (Wohlgenannt et al., 2020; Kugler, 2021) . For context, commercial VR systems in 2016 required expensive and difficult setups including an HMD headset, controllers, and sensors connected to an external high-graphics computer. However, some current new generation VR sets such as Oculus Quest 2 (Menlo Park, CA) and HTC VIVE Focus series (Taiwan), generally referred as stand-alone VR systems, or all-in-one solutions, do not even depend on any external computer system (Wohlgenannt et al., 2020) , increasing accessibility further. Coupled with very recent developments such as the popular metaverse concept that combines multiple elements of VR/AR and internet technologies to achieve an extended reality by blending physical and digital worlds together (Lee et al., 2021) , we anticipate that VR/AR technologies will finally go mainstream.\n"," In systems biology, we often seek to provide new insights that weave data on molecules, pathways, cells and tissues to whole organisms, populations, and ecosystems in multiple time-and length-scales. Furthermore, new high-throughput-omics experimental techniques are producing massive and diverse multi-omics datasets (Gillette et al., 2020; Kalayci et al., 2020; Petralia et al., 2020; Marx, 2021; Satpathy et al., 2021) , and detailed data capture is boosted further by advances in supercomputers and tracking sensor technologies. Parallel increases in processor speeds and data storage enable computational analyses of these data (Schadt et al., 2010) . New or updated visualization technologies are needed to explore and communicate these datasets. While not new in scientific visualizations (Bryson, 1996; Simpson et al., 2000) , VR technologies offer novel avenues to these unprecedented new data communication needs. However, much remains to be answered on when and how to use VR/AR technologies in systems biology.\n"," To help answer these questions for different use cases, we first provide a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of using VR technologies in Table 2 . Notably, their greatest advantage is in providing unparalleled presence-the sense of being inside of and interacting with the virtual environment (Slater and Wilbur, 1997; Schubert et al., 2001; Sutcliffe et al., 2005) . Therefore, we recommend utilizing VR/AR technologies when spatial presence and immersive interactivity with the content makes a difference in addressing user needs. User comprehension may become somewhat limited in 2D above domain-specific data type and size thresholds, leading to data occlusions. In such cases, immersion enables 3D-navigation and provides the necessary perceptive depth to enhance comprehension. For example, for multi-dimensional data, user studies have reported significantly better performance for immersive 3D vs. 2D environments for certain analysis tasks (Etemadpour et al., 2013) . As researchers working at the interface of biology and data visualization, based on our own experience in this domain, and observations on the general trends in VR applications in biology that we briefly summarize here, we anticipate their utilization in three main areas in systems biology: 1) visually exploring and communicating data; 2) performing virtual experiments; and 3) education/teaching and discuss them below.\n"," Systems biology visualizations are generally abstract representations, far from real-world objects. For instance, cellular pathway graphs are often cartoon representations. Yet, they suffice in helping understand the biological phenomena they represent. In VR environments, users interpret such abstractions as real objects, and the imagery has a lasting impact on our brains. Furthermore, we can interact with the virtual objects in ways that are not possible in the real world at multiple scales, from single molecules (Leinen et al., 2015) , protein-drug complexes (Norrby et al., 2015) biomolecular networks (Liluashvili et al., 2017) to organs (Mirhosseini et al., 2014) ; navigate through them (Bellmund et al., 2016) , or dynamics (Nakano et al., 2016) . VR technologies thus open the door to benefit diverse phenomena that involve 3D spatial reconstructions, from localizations and dynamics in the human brain (Calì et al., 2016) to interactions in retinal pathology (Aaker et al., 2011) and volumetric studies in digital pathology (Farahani et al., 2016; Liimatainen et al., 2021) . More recently, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) in immersive VR has been used to visualize biological structures as point clouds at the molecular scale (e.g., vLUME by Spark et al., 2020) . Some of these recent SMLM tools can be further extended to other similarly multidimensional spatially localized point clouds (e.g., Genuage tool by Blanc et al., 2020) .\n"," In systems biology, the knowledge, visualization, and exploration of related 3D structural data often play an important role. To explore and understand the function of macromolecules (proteins, RNA, and DNA) and their complexes from their 3D structural models, molecular graphics is shifting to VR (Tse et al., 2011; Nakano et al., 2016; Ratamero et al., 2018; Cassidy et al., 2020; Todd and Emsley, 2021) . Some of these applications further integrate relevant structural knowledge with domain-specific (Norrby et al., 2015) , or genomics datasets (Zhang et al., 2019) . While some molecular viewers work in CAVE environments (Block et al., 2009) , others utilize latest HMDs (Leinen et al., 2015) , game engines such as Unity and gesture devices such as Kinect and Leap Motion (Probst and Reymond, 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) or even voice recognition (Sabir et al., 2013) to activate commands; or provide web-based VR without head-tracking or advanced interactions (Li et al., 2014; Cassidy et al., 2020) . Parallel efforts are also on-going to study the chemical fingerprints of DrugBank compounds in VR environments (Probst and Reymond, 2018) .\n"," VR is useful even when exploring abstract systems-level data that do not contain 3Dlocalizations. For example, researchers often employ complex network visualizations which may require many viewpoints due to clutter, and navigation issues. Several studies suggest stereoscopy alone (Ware and Mitchell, 2008; Greffard et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Kwon et al., 2016) or combined with rotation (Sollenberger and Milgram, 1993) or motion cues (Ware and Mitchell, 2008) enhances performance in comprehension, helps present graphs better than 2D-displays (Sollenberger and Milgram, 1993) and enables low user error rates (Ware and Mitchell, 2008) . For example, Supplementary Figure S1 shows a relatively large network in 2D, and Supplementary Video S1 in 3D. While both are generated using the network visualization tool iCAVE (Liluashvili et al., 2017; Kalayci and Gümüş, 2018) , within iCAVE users can further interactively explore the 3D or stereo versions from multiple perspectives. Visualizations from multiple perspectives reportedly make different aspects of a system more salient (Ellis et al., 1991) . Similarly, the BigTop tool (Westreich et al., 2020) renders Manhattan plots from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 3D.\n"," More recently, VR is used to explore multidimensional -omics datasets in systems biology including cytometry, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and their combinations, in the form of abstract data clouds. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis often includes a dimensionality reduction step, where cell populations are projected in 2D or 3D space to explore cellular heterogeneity. Visualizing such datasets in 3D can be more informative as it decreases the possibility of collapsing similar cell types and clusters. A recent tool, CellexalVR, allows visual exploration and analysis of such dimensionality reduction plots and associated metadata in immersive VR (Legetth et al., 2021) . Other tools for the same purpose include starmapVR (Yang et al., 2020) , singlecellVR (Stein et al., 2021) and Theia (Bressan et al., 2021) . These platforms often include additional modalities such as on-the-fly clustering, or visualization of dynamic changes in RNA velocity. While singlecellVR and starmapVR are web applications that enable visualizations using low-cost and easily available VR hardware such as Google Cardboard (Yang et al., 2020; Stein et al., 2021) , CellexalVR involves GPU-accelerated performance and in-session on-the-fly calculations. StarmapVR further enables simultaneous visualization of spatial transcriptomics data from matching histological images. We anticipate that in the near future we will witness further developments in VR tools for the visual exploration of spatial transcriptomics datasets.\n"," For research studies that cannot be performed in the real world, VR provides a safe, standardized, and reproducible environment that is as life-like as possible (Tarr and Warren, 2002) . In addition, we can break the laws of optics and physics, or disconnect real life sensed by the user's body from the world the user is experiencing (Tarr and Warren, 2002) . Researchers have been using such VR properties to study, modify or enhance behavior. For example, neural processes research that links biology and behavior in different species, from insects to humans (Ravassard et al., 2013; Aghajan et al., 2015; Acharya et al., 2016) has used VR to help understand sensory cues that carry information on the virtual worlds or refine the rules that link a subject's actions to changes in their world. In addition to assisting in understanding human behavior, research can in turn inform how VR environments can be improved in design for increased human engagement. For example, studies suggest that the socially networked nature of VR should be considered in tool design, as numbers of remote users in virtual spaces increase (Kruzan and Won, 2019; Jeong et al., 2021) .\n"," In systems biology, virtual experiments can help develop and improve scientific thinking skills. Virtual reformulations of experiments in the form of games to be solved have already proven efficiency in tackling scientific problems. For example, the tools Foldit (Foldit, 2022) and Eterna (Eterna, 2022) have gamified the protein folding and RNA structure prediction problems (Das et al., 2019) , and thereby enabled more individuals to perform virtual experiments by engaging the online gaming community whose members may have little to no scientific knowledge. Yet, these gamers have successfully solved real-world problems in relatively short time scales (Cooper et al., 2010; Khatib et al., 2011; Eiben et al., 2012; Horowitz et al., 2016; Koepnick et al., 2019) . Similarly, the tool EyeWire has gamified mapping neural circuits in the brain to understand vision, where players try to virtually map 3D neuron structures to serial electron microscopy image data from animal brains (Das et al., 2019; EyeWire, 2022) . This game has so far attracted more than 150 K gamers who helped reveal 6 new neuron types and many undiscovered brain circuits (EyeWire Into the Brain, 2022). VR environments open exciting new possibilities of such gamification of virtual scientific problems both for scientists with little coding experience, as well as for non-scientists, and the communication between these two communities. We have already started to observe the first examples of such tools in computational chemistry, where Shannon et al have introduced molecular dynamics VR game to encourage users to explore the reactivity of a specific chemical system (Shannon et al., 2021) , and an intuitive VR platform called Nanome presented by Kingsley et al., where the users explore and modify chemical structures collaboratively to work on structural biology and molecular drug design problems (Kingsley et al., 2019) . The next several years will witness an increasing number of tools that gamify virtual experiments in the VR environments. Note that in online gaming communities, VR is increasingly blended with social media functionalities, and thus gamified systems biology VR tools will likely need to consider such additional functionalities that are critical for remote users.\n"," VR environments can help learning in systems biology areas that involve complex 3D information (Salzman et al., 1999; Mikropoulos and Natsis, 2011) , user-interactivity and/or high computational skills. For example, understanding protein structure traditionally involves physical modeling kits or projections of the 3D structures into 2D. However, the ability to create, alter, and rotate a chemical structure in real time in 3D can make it easier to understand abstract concepts (Limniou et al., 2008) . Similarly, annotated 3D web-based anatomy atlases help teach complex structures such as artery networks or bronchial trees. Earlier interactive 3D-renderings of these systems used desktops with standard screens due to the costs of VR processors and displays (Li et al., 2012) , while later technologies have enabled stereoscopic immersive 3D with real-time interactivity (Kockro et al., 2007) . Randomized user studies show that stereo-enhanced 3D-tools are useful in learning anatomy and are well-received by students (Kockro et al., 2015; de Faria et al., 2016) . Similarly, integrating AR technology reportedly has positive impact on student learning in biology (Weng et al., 2020) .\n"," Recent technological advances in VR have substantially increased their potential utility in learning. Biological concepts currently constitute ~5% of academic publications on VR (Morimoto and Ponton, 2021) . Relatively popular educational platforms include those that simulate biological and chemical experiments within VR environments, such as VRLab Academy (United Kingdom), Labster (Denmark), and ClassVR (United Kingdom). Advances in gaming have expanded VR applications in education as well. For example, the tool Peppy provides a Unity-based VR gaming engine to understand protein structures and their dynamics in undergraduate biochemistry classes (Doak et al., 2020) . Similarly, Pepblock Builder VR tool provides a gamified interface for researchers who are not advanced in the computational skills required for protein design (Yallapragada et al., 2021) .\n"," Many educational VR experiences exist in popular gaming platforms that recreate biological systems, such as The Body VR, where players move in the bloodstream to observe human cells and learn how organelles function (The Body VR LLC, 2016) , and InCell VR, where players fight to stop a virus invasion in human, while learning about cell and organelle microstructures (Luden.io, 2015) . We anticipate that gaming-based VR tools will similarly be developed for learning multi-omics datasets at a systems level. Further research will then be necessary to understand the full potential impact of VR in learning systems biology.\n"," The recent explosion in VR/AR technologies has coincided with extended work-from-home practices due to the coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic. These developments have lowered resistance to virtual technologies and in fact created a pressing need for virtual, collaborative workspaces in research. Coupled with the explosive increase in datasets collected from multi-omics high-throughput experiments, VR/AR technologies offer attractive new opportunities for visual data exploration and communication in systems biology. However, to develop the most useful tools, systems biologists need to conduct their own user studies and get familiar with design practices within virtual spaces for improved human perception (Cleveland and McGill, 1987) . With deeper understandings of the brain and visual perception, content creation and best practices will be established, and adoption will increase. Further technological improvements (higher frame rates, efficient information storage and rendering; increased data transfer with less bit rates; game engines; graphics cards) will aid challenging visualizations such as dynamic networks or multi-scale systems, integrated with data annotations and on-the-fly calculations. Visualization outcomes will in turn guide future research protocols.\n"," VR application development is already easier with HMDs and input devices that offer game engine-compatible free software development kits. These render information from internetworked devices that collect and exchange data with sensors and network connections (Rose, 2014; Akyildiz et al., 2015; Open Hybrid, 2022) or from integrating multiple technologies (e.g., healthcare in cyberspace (Rosen et al., 2016) ). We anticipate that new technologies will further eliminate discomforts and limitations of modern VR headsets such as their bulkiness and weight. Towards this end, current studies include using skin sensory interfaces, such as nanowire-based soft wearable HMIs , and thin and light-weight holographic optics with high performance sunglasses-like near-eye full-color displays, as developed by Facebook Reality Labs (Maimone and Wang, 2020) . Such new technologies may remove the barriers between the virtual and real worlds further by eliminating headset use, thereby converging VR/AR (Kugler, 2021) .\n"," In summary, we are currently at a critical juncture for VR/AR use in systems biology, as they are finally on the verge of going mainstream. We anticipate that the current trends towards utilizing low-cost VR/AR systems will continue. Still, for certain research areas, interactive 3D applications in Web3D will likely suffice. For some applications, AR will be preferable, as it allows users to overlap virtual data onto the real world in relatively simpler set-ups such as smartphones, without the need of HMDs, and provide more control of their surroundings (Garcia-Bonete et al., 2019) . VR will likely remain advantageous in applications that require better immersion and realism (Garcia-Bonete et al., 2019) . Barriers for access to VR/AR visualizations in systems biology will likely remain, however, for researchers from underdeveloped countries, and which will need to be addressed. At the same time, with the increasing trends in gamification within the VR environments (Shannon et al., 2021) , barriers for scientists with low computational expertise and nonscientists in conducting their own virtual experiments will decrease. As user community grows and commercial VR/AR technologies expand, we expect the range of their systems biology applications will also continue to grow, opening possibilities for significant advancements in understanding and communicating disease-associated mechanisms, running virtual experiments, and education, and help boost the development of new therapies. Of course, the best way to gauge possibilities is to explore them!\n"," Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n"," This study was supported by the Concern Foundation Conquer Cancer Now award and Cancer Moonshot R33 award # CA263705-01 to ZG.\n"," The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n"," Page 14 \n"," Track user position (x, y, z) coordinates and orientation (yaw, pitch, roll angles) as users move about (either all or some) \"User position\" may be body movements, head-rotations, or gestures Feed tracking information back to the computer for real-time display updates (e.g., 3D mouse (wand) or data gloves) Types Generally use 3D computer vision, sync pulses and laser lines, or inertial measurement units to recognize movements, gestures and positioning to achieve intuitive tracking Full-body Tracking \n","Score: 1.510955596169538\n","\n","Title: Modeling of a Speed Control System Using Event-B\n","Body Text: The case study, proposed in the context of the ABZ2020 conference, is composed of two parts: Adaptive Exterior Light and Speed Control Systems. Since the whole case study is quite lengthy/complex and the two parts are only loosely coupled as stated in the description document, we chose to handle each part in a separate paper. The present paper deals with the speed control system whereas a companion paper considers the adaptive exterior light system [7] .\n"," The goal of the speed control system is to regulate the current speed of a car according to a set of criteria like the speed desired by the driver, the position of a possible preceding vehicle but also a given speed limit that the driver must not exceed. The system can behave according to two options: the first one regulates the speed independently on the any preceding vehicle, the second component takes into account the position of a possible preceding vehicle by maintaining a safety distance. The driver has the possibility to choose which option to activate at a given moment. Like a controller, in both options, the system reads different informations from the available sensors (key state, desired speed, the preceding vehicle position, etc.) and takes the adequate actions by acting on the actuators of the car's speed according to the read information.\n"," The present paper describes the formal modeling of the speed control system using the Event-B method and its refinement technique that permits to master the complexity of a system by gradually introducing its different elements/characteristics. Proposed by Abrial as a successor of the B method [1] , the Event-B method [2] permits to model discrete systems using mathematical notations. An Event-B specification is made of two elements: context and machine. A context describes the static part of an Event-B specification; it consists of constants and sets (user-defined types) together with axioms that specify their properties. The dynamic part is included in a machine that defines variables and a set of events. The possible values that the variables can hold are specified by an invariant using a first-order formula on the state variables. The different machines composing an Event-B specification are related with a refinement relation whereas the contexts are linked with an extension link (extends). Each refinement adds new information to a model; these could be new state variables, new events or new properties. Event-B refinement allows for guard strengthening, nondeterminism reduction, and new events introduction. New events of a model M that refines a model M are considered to refine a skip event of M , hence they cannot modify a variable of M . Therefore, all events that need to modify a variable v must be defined in the same model where v is first introduced. The correctness of an Event-B model is ensured by proof obligations that verify that the invariant is preserved by each event and that the refinement preserves the properties of the system.\n"," The development of our Event-B models has been done under the Rodin platform [3] that provides editors, provers and several other plugins for various tasks like animation and model checking with ProB [5] . We use ProB in order to animate the built models with two purposes: exhibiting the problematic scenarios that violate the invariant prior to the hard/long proof phase, but also validating the specification by playing the provided scenarios in order to be sure that we have specified the right system. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our modelling strategy. Section 3 describes our model in more details. Section 4 describes the validation and verification of our model. Section 5 identifies the weaknesses of the requirements document provided for the case study, and the adequacy of the Event-B method for constructing a model of this case study. We conclude in Sect. 6.\n"," The speed control system subject of this paper can be seen as a control system that interacts with its environment through a set of sensors, which provide it with information about the state of the physical elements, and a set of actuators that are used to transmit the adequate orders to these elements. In this paper, we use the concepts described in [10] . A sensor measures the value of some environment elements m, called a monitored variable (e.g., the state of the ignition key), and provides this measure (e.g., whether the key is inserted or not) to the software controller as an input variable i. The software controller can influence the environment by sending commands, called output variable o to actuators. An actuator influences the value of some characteristics of the environment, call a controlled variable c. Variables m and c are called environment variables. Variables i and o are called controller variables. Finally, a controller has its own internal state variables to perform computations. In this case study, we use Event-B state variables to represent both environment and controller variables. We do not model sensor or actuator failures.\n"," A well-known architecture of a control system is a control loop that reads all input variables at once, at a given moment, and then computes all output variables in the same iteration. But, it can be also viewed as a continuous system that can be interrupted by any change in the environment represented by a new value sent by a sensor. In this paper, we see the controller as a distributed system; each sub-system is associated to a given sensor. In that case, the system reacts to each single modification of the sensor. This approach can be seen as a more abstract approach, as it is common in the Event-B style of system modeling. We define one event for each input variable change, which allows for a more modular specification that is easier to prove. This is closer to an interrupt-driven control system. Our Event-B abstraction is also a reasonable abstraction for a control loop, considering that in most cases, a single input variable changes between two control loop iterations. The control loop can be derived from our specification by merging all events and defining priorities between events.\n"," This section briefly describes the main modeling elements that characterize our specification. The complete archive of the Event-B project is available in [6] . Let us note that the development of our model (Event-B components, proofs, animation, etc.) took about two months including the different exchanges with the authors of the case study. Our model contains 4 contexts and 4 machines/refinements. Table 1 relates the components of our model with the requirements listed in [4] . As one can remark, some requirements are modelled as invariants whereas others are dealt with in the adequate events. We chose to do not model some requirements as invariants because this would make the modeling and the proof activities more complex and difficult. Requirement SCS-41 for example: \". . . the self-test of the radar system is restarted every 10 min\" is modeled by a variable nextTest that is set to the current time plus 10 min in the events that represent the movement of the key and the progression of the time because the self-test of the radar system should be performed at the start (the key is in the ignition position) and then every 10 min. Modeling this requirement as an invariant would require the introduction of two extra variables to store the moments of two consecutive self-test activities, then we have to state that 10 min should be elapsed between these two moments.\n"," Machine M 0 models the current speed of the studied car independently from any preceding vehicle and also without giving any condition on its evolution. This machine defines the following unique invariant:\n"," where rangeSpeed denotes a constant defined in the context C0 to set the range values for the speed (rangeSpeed = 0..5000). Machine M 0 defines a unique event updateV ehicleSpeed to set the current speed of the car as follows:\n"," Machine M 1 introduces the physical elements that are manipulated by the driver and that have an impact on the current speed of the car. These elements include gas/brake pedal, key, cruise control lever, etc. Machine M 1 describes how the position of each of these elements evolves depending on its current position. In this same machine, we also introduce the event progress that makes the current time keep progressing. Machine M 2 models the desired speed together with the activation of the normal/adaptive cruise control and also the traffic sign detection that has an impact on the value of the desired speed according to the requirements (SCS-36,SCS-39). It is worth noting that some events, like that related to the traffic sign detection, are introduced in M 1 even if this aspect is really dealt with in Machine M 2. Indeed, these events need to modify some variables that are introduced in M 1 and, as noted before, a new event cannot modify a variable defined in a previous refinement level. Machine M 3 specifies the different aspects that depend on or impact the desired/current speed like speed-dependent safety distance that also depends on the speed of the preceding vehicle but also the faults that can happen on the radar system. The main elements of these Event-B components are described hereafter.\n"," This machine refines Machine M0 by introducing the different elements that impact the current speed of the car. This includes the physical elements that Table 1 . Cross-reference between the components of our model and the requirements of [4] Requirements [4] Component Invariant/event\n"," SCS-3, SCS-12, SCS-13, SCS-16, SCS-17, SCS-31\n"," inv6 and inv7\n"," Not covered since no information is given on how the system reaches/ maintain the desired speed \n"," Not covered since the light system is not included the driver manipulates, the radar system that gives the distance to the nearest obstacle but also the time progression since it makes some variables evolve like the desired speed. For that purpose, several variables/invariants are introduced to model how the position of the physical elements evolves depending on its current position. In this paper, we give details about the radar the system, the time progression and also the cruise control lever. The state of the radar system is modelled by a Boolean variable rangeRadarState. This variable is initialized to FALSE since the ignition is Off at the beginning then its state is updated each 10 min. Therefore, we define a variable nextT est to store the moment of the next radar system self-test. These variables are defined by the following invariants:\n"," where KeyState is a variable representing the position of the key ({N oKeyInserted, KeyInserted, KeyInIgnitionOnP osition}). This invariant expresses that the state of the radar system is checked 10 min after the state (keyState = KeyInIgnitionOnP osition). Let us remark the value of 6000 is equal to (10 × 600) since we choose a progression time step of a tenth of a second because some data in the case study are with 0.1 precision as depicted by the following progress event that models the time progression: .\n"," Guard grd1 specifies that when the time progresses to the next self-test moment (nextT est = currentT ime + 1) and the stating of the system (keyState = KeyInIgnitionOnP osition), the state of the radar system is chosen randomly (rdstate ∈ BOOL) otherwise its state remains the same (radstate = rangeRadarState in grd2).\n"," Similarly, cruise control lever is modeled by the variable SCSLeverU D and its typing invariant: SCSLeverU D ∈ SCSLeverP ositions where SCSLeverP ositions is a given set defined in Context C1 seen by M 1 : For each of these elements, invariants are defined in Machine M 1 to specify the authorized position changes together with the event that models them. The following invariant states that the cruise control level cannot directly move from an Upward position to a Downward position bypassing the Neutral position. As we can remark, the above invariant uses an extra variable SCSLeverU DP to model the previous position of the cruise control level. In the next section, we show that this kind of variables is also relevant for modeling some requirements that need to make reference to the current and previous states of the system.\n"," Machine M 1 defines event moveSCSLeverUD that models the cruise control level movements where grd2 permits to make the invariant preserved after the observation of this event: \n"," This machine describes how the desired speed evolves according to the requirements (SCS-1 to SCS-12) by moving the cruise control level into different positions. We also model the activation of the normal/adaptive cruise control as described in the document. In addition, we specify the speed limit requirements (SCS-29 to SCS-34) because the calculation of the current speed must respect such a limit.\n"," Mainly, this machine introduces some additional variables to model the desired speed (desiredSpeed) and the normal/adaptive cruise control (normContr and adapContr) with their associated variables to represent their previous values. For instance, the following invariant defines the activation of the normal cruise control:\n"," The invariant states that, if the normal mode is selected for the cruise control and the brake pedal is not activated, the normal cruise control is activated the first time when the cruise control level moves to the forward position while the current speed is greater than 200 km/h and or the desired speed is not null and remains activated as long as the cruise control level is not put in the Backward position.\n"," To model the desired speed whose evolution depends on the time, we store the last time (lastT imeSCSLeverU D) when the cruise control level has been in the Up/down positions. Thus requirements SCS-4 and SCS-7 are modeled as follows. Requirement SCS-4 specifies that, while the cruise control is activated, the desired speed increases by 1 the first time the cruise control level is put in position Upward5 whereas Requirement SCS-7 states that the desired speed continues to increase by 1 by each second as long as the cruise control level stays in that position for more than 2 s. Variable lastdesiredSpeed represents the desired speed when the lever has been moved into a given position.\n"," Let us give more explanation about the last invariant. Expression (currentT ime − lastT imeSCSLeverU D − 10) permits to update the desired speed immediately after 2 s, this is why we subtract 10 units of time and not 20. As stated before, as we chose a progression step of tenth of a second, we must divide by 10 each data related to the time. To make these invariants preserved, we have refined the moveSCSLeverUD event according to Requirement SCS-4 but also the progress event with respect to Requirement SCS-7. Event progress for instance is refined by adding the following guard that calculates the new desired speed:\n"," The above guard distinguishes different cases according to the position of the control lever and the time elapsed since its last position change(currentT ime + 1 − lastT imeSCSLeverU D ≥ 20). The term (currentT ime + 1) denotes the after-value of currentT ime when Event progress is observed. The following cases have been distinguished:\n"," 1. if the time elapsed from the last movement of the lever is less than 2 s then, the desired speed does not change (case 1), otherwise 2. if the lever is at the Upward5 position, the desired speed increases by 1 every second (10 × tenth of a second): SCS-7, case 2. otherwise the lever is in the Upward7 position and the desired speed increases to the next ten's place after each 2 s: SCS-8, case 3. 3. if the lever is at the Downward5 position, the desired speed decreases by 1 every second (10 × tenth of a second): SCS-9, case 4. otherwise the lever is in the Upward7 position and the desired speed increases to the next ten's place after each 2 s: SCS-10, case 5.\n"," Let us note that the Event-B method and its underlying language is not well-adapted to model the evolution of the speed vehicle according to its acceleration/speed and the time passing. Indeed, since the language does not support real numbers, we model the current speed as an integer amount that evolves according to the usual equation (V = γ × t + V p ) where the γ represents the acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle, (t = 1) the time progression and V p the previous speed. As our time progression is by a tenth of a second, the progression of the speed is very small, that is, less than one kilometer. This progression can not be taken into account using the B language. To overcome such a limit, we proceed as follows. We do not include the increasing/decreasing of the current speed in the event that makes the time progress but we introduce a new event setSpeed that sets the current speed to a given value. This also permits to play and produce the scenarios provided in the case study. Another alternative to overcome the lack of reals in the Event-B language is to define or reuse an existing theory plugin that models them [11] . However, this will make the development and the proofs more complex since the interactive prover of Rodin does not adequately support such a concept, that it a proof that uses a theory can not be saved.\n"," In this level, we model the different aspects that depend on or impact the desired/current speed, like speed-dependent safety distance and the speed of the preceding vehicle. Moreover, we model the faults that can happen on the radar system. Machine M 3 introduces two new events turnHead and VehicHeadDetect to model respectively the selection of a safety level by turning the cruise control lever head and the detection of a preceding vehicle by catching its speed that is relevant for determining the speed-dependent safety distance and also to make the system decelerates if it is necessary. Event VehicHeadDetect for instance is specified as follows: \n"," Event parameter val represents the distance between the studied car and a possible preceding vehicle as provided by the radar. Guard grd2 states that such a value should be equal to 255 if the radar system is not ready. Guards grd4-grd7 permit to calculate the new value for the speed-dependent safety distance according to the requirements SCS-23 and SCS-24 with the event parameter speh denoting the speed of the preceding vehicle.\n"," Already existing events of M 2 are refined in M 3 in similar way by calculating the value of the different variables. For instance, the desired speed should be updated when a traffic sign is detected, the speed-dependent safety distance is updated when the current speed is modified or the speed of a preceding vehicle changes. More details can be found in [6] .\n"," To ensure the correctness and validate the built Event-B models, we have proceeded into three steps detailed hereafter.\n"," We used the ProB tool as a model checker in order to ensure that all the invariants of each machine are preserved after the observation of each event, that is, there is no sequence of events that makes an invariant not satisfied. Basically, when an invariant becomes violated, ProB exhibits such a sequence of events that, starting from a valid initial state of the machine, leading to a state that violates the related invariant. Such specification errors can be due to a guard/action missing, to an incorrect specification of the invariant but sometimes also to an incorrect property, that is the system really does not satisfy the property. Let us note that even if no invariant violation is found by the tool, there may still exist scenarios that violate the invariant that the tool cannot find due to their complexity or/and the timeout on the model checking process. This is why a proof phase should be performed to ensure that the specification is invariant-violation free.\n"," This step aims at verifying that we have built the right model whose behaviors conform to the desired ones as described by the scenarios of the specification document. For that purpose, the animation capability of ProB is used to play the different scenarios provided in the case study. This step allows us to point out some flaws/ambiguities in the initial release of the description document. For instance, the initial examples provided to illustrate the requirements SCS-5-SCS-9 were incorrect with respect to the requirements. In addition, in some place like SCS-7-SCS-9, the term \"target speed\" is used instead of \"desired speed\", etc. All these aspects have been discussed with the case study authors because we are not specialists of the domain. Let us note that we have faced some difficulties to play the provided scenarios since no information is provided on how the controller calculates the acceleration at each step. So, we have made our best to \"simulate\" these values without any representation about their suitability, reliability.\n"," This last phase aims at ensuring the correctness of the specification by discharging all the proof obligations generated by Rodin to prove that the invariants are preserved by each event, but also that the guard of each refined event is stronger than that of the abstract one. Figure 1 provides the proof statistics of the case study: 579 proof obligations have been generated, of which 60% (345) were automatically proved by the various provers. The remaining proof obligations were discharged interactively since they needed the use of external provers like the Mono Lemma prover that has shown to be very useful for arithmetic formulas even if we had to add some theorems on min/max operators (a min/max of a finite set is an element of the set, etc) but also on the transitivity property of the comparison operator (≥, ≤, etc.).\n"," This section reports on some points about the choices made during the Event-B modeling of the speed control system.\n"," The formal modeling of the specification document [4] lead us to question ourselves about the semantics of some requirement and identify a number of ambiguities and some contradictions with the test scenarios provided. Being not specialist of the domain, we have communicated these to the authors of the requirements document, and a number of revisions were produced, following our comments. Our discussion and exchange lead to the modification/revision of a set of requirements to make them clearer and consistent. A detailed list of these elements are described in the last version (i.e., 1.17) of the requirements document: As already well-known, the use of a formal method does not only permit to built a correct system but it also allows to make the requirement document clearer and precise by removing ambuities and errors.\n"," As stated before, a number of requirements refer to the current and previous state of an element. In order to be able to verify these requirements using a proof strategy, we modeled them as invariants by introducing two variables for each element to store their current and previous values. The obtained specification is quite cumbersome especially that we have to add for each event that does not modify a variable that its previous value is equal to its current value. We think that it would be interesting to investigate existing tools/approaches that could help us specify this kind of properties in a simpler manner. An example of such tools is the Event-B State machines plugin 1 that produces Event-B events from a state machine including their guards that specify the requirements modeled by the state machine but without producing the related invariants. This plugin makes difficult to trace and justify the usefulness of the generated guards.\n"," This paper presents a formal modeling proposal of a speed control system using the Event-B method. We have modelled most of requirements that permits us to point out some ambiguities in the requirements that we have discussed and clarified with the case study authors by rephrasing them. These ambiguities have been discovered during during different development phases: formalization, proof and validation using the provided scenarios. This experience has affirmed that the formal modeling of a system helps the software users detect error in early development phase that makes its correction cheaper.\n"," The main difficulty when modeling the speed control system is to determine the order in which elements should be introduced during the refinement especially that many elements are interdependent. Due to time constraints, we were unfortunately not able to explore the different decomposition plugins of Rodin that might produce smaller specification parts that would be easier to understand and maintain. We plan to explore some decomposition techniques as future work even if we really think that the Event-B method should include modularization clauses as native structuring mechanisms like those of the B method that permit to have a modular specification since the early development phases to make Event-B method more usable for the development of big and complex systems. Another point concerns the ProB plugin under Rodin that unfortunately does not permit to store an already played scenario, so we are obliged to manually replay each scenario; this is a very time-consuming for long traces.\n"," The work presented in this paper can also be extended by considering the remaining requirements that need more clarifications. Requirement SCS-21 for instance needs more information on how the system can deduce that deceleration of 3 m/s 2 is insufficient to prevent a collision without having any information about the acceleration of the preceding vehicle. Also, we think that more information should be provided on the internal variables like setV ehicleSpeed that represents the automatic acceleration of the system in order to able to build a more complete system. Finally through the different case studies proposed in the ABZ conference [8, 9] , we are now convinced of the need to improve the Event-B language to make it supports the real numbers as basic types. Its prover should be also extended to include more rules on arithmetic and set theories.\n","Score: 1.4962501392994394\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof Regional Trauma Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic Regional Trauma Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n","Body Text: The current global pandemic has impacted heavily on health systems, making unprecedented demands on resources, and forcing reconfiguration of services.\n"," Trauma and orthopaedic units have cancelled elective surgery, moved to virtual based clinics and have been forced to reconsider the provision of trauma. Our national elective orthopaedic centre has been re-designated as a trauma centre to allow tertiary centres re-direct triaged trauma. Many governments, as part of their COVID-19 management, have significantly restricted activity of the general population. We proposed that trauma patterns would change alongside these changes and maintaining existing standards of treatment would require dedicated planning and structures.\n"," Referrals over a six-week period (March 15 th -April 30 th ) were retrospectively reviewed. Data was collected directly from our referral database and a database populated. Analysis was performed to assess trauma volume, aetiology, and changes in trends.\n"," There were one hundred and fifty-nine referrals from three individual hospitals within the timeframe. Mean age of patient's referred was 55 (range17-92). Males accounted for 45% of cases. F&A injuries were the most common (32%), followed by H&W (28%), UL (17%), H&F (16%) and K&T (7%). In comparison to the corresponding time-period in 2019, trauma theatre activity reduced by almost one half (45.3%)\n"," The majority of trauma referred to our Dublin based centre during COVID-19 related population restrictions appears to be home based and trauma volumes have decreased. Significant reductions are apparent in work and sport related injuries suggestive of compliance with COVID-19 activity guidelines. Maintaining existing standards of treatment requires dedicated planning.\n"," The current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on health systems in an unprecedented fashion, producing enormous demands on resources(1). COVID-19\n"," is an abbreviation of coronavirus disease 2019 and refers to the illness arising from infection with the new viral agent SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak which initiated the pandemic originated in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China (2).\n"," Trauma and orthopaedic units, in Ireland amongst others, have cancelled non-urgent elective surgery, moved to virtual based clinics, and made fundamental changes to the provision of trauma(3). This has been in keeping with national and international guidance (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . The scope of routine trauma management has changed, with services reconfigured to alleviate pressure caused by these resource demands.\n"," Symptomatic of the potential impact on trauma provision, the British Orthopaedic Association have released a pandemic specific BOAST guideline to support practitioners in making difficult treatment decisions during this time(4).\n"," Furthermore, governments across the world, have placed varying restrictions on the activity of populations to limit the spread of COVID-19 (9) . One by-product of these emergency measures is a likely alteration in the volume and type of trauma occurring. The first laboratory confirmed case was recorded in Ireland on February 29 th . Schools and cultural institutions were closed from March 12 th with non-essential businesses closing from March 24 th . A stay-at-home order was issued on March 27 th with brief exercise within two kilometres of the home allowed. This specific stay-athome order was sequentially extended through to May 5 th (10) . The country then J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f entered its re-opening phase with graduated reintroduction of non-essential activities over the course of the following six weeks (11) .\n"," As an example of reconfiguration undertaken, our national elective orthopaedic unit, based in the Dublin metropolitan area, was re-designated as a trauma unit on March 18th of 2020, with the suspension of all non-urgent elective surgery. The intended purpose was to divert pre-triaged low energy trauma in non COVID-19 patients away from tertiary centres within our metropolitan area. We undertook a review of the pattern of injuries referred to our reconfigured unit during this time. Trauma surgery commenced in our unit on March 18 th .\n"," Our unit acts as a national centre of excellence in adult and paediatric orthopaedic medicine, sports and exercise medicine and rehabilitation medicine, employing over 500 staff and incorporating an on-site radiology service. As a high-volume 159 bed unit, throughput averages 65 overnight cases and 100 day cases per week and more than 1500 primary and revision hip and knee arthroplasties per year. The hospital treats over 24,000 patients annually. Time from referral to surgery was recorded in days. Theatre activity data in the three trauma hospitals was collected for the corresponding time-period in 2019 and 2020 to allow for year on year comparison. χ 2 test was performed to analyse the data using Excel.\n"," There were 159 referrals for surgery from the three north of city hospitals for the time-period given. Females accounted for 55% (82/179) of cases. The mean age of patients was 55 (Range 17-92). The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1 (Range 0-8). The mean time to surgery from referral was 3 days (Range 0-17).\n"," F&A injuries were the most common (32%), followed by H&W (28%), UL (17%), H&F (16%) and K&T (7%). In comparison to the month of April in 2019, trauma theatre activity reduced by almost one half (45.3%), when remaining activity and transferred activity was considered, in the three referring hospitals (Table 1) .\n"," Injuries were sustained at home in 50% of cases. This varied significantly between pre (33%) and post (59%) 'lockdown'. Falls outside of the home happened in 45% of cases pre lockdown and in 36% of cases post lockdown ( Table 2) . Of the 159 referrals; in the pre-lockdown period there were 24 at home and 31 outside home;\n"," during the post-lockdown phase there were 66 at home and 38 outside of home, see post-operatively.\n"," The landscape of orthopaedic practice has changed for the foreseeable future.\n"," Urgent elective cases and trauma will be prioritised while the pandemic continues.\n"," Current restrictions in activity have impacted on the volume of trauma occurring and the type of injuries sustained (12) . Data from our region shows a significant reduction in operative trauma presenting to acute hospitals for this period when compared to 2019. Simple falls at home are the most common mechanism. The data depicts a shift from the pre 'lockdown' period when simple falls outside the home were more common. Compliance with activity restrictions have reduced sporting and workrelated injuries while increasing home improvement and personal exercise injuries, reflected by an increase in medium energy injuries around the home. Pilon type ankle fractures made up 10% of the foot and ankle cases with tri-malleolar fractures making up a further 28%. While our trauma model, in combination with reduced volumes, has allowed trauma to be treated along existing guidelines the expectation is that volumes will increase as work, leisure, and travel activity increases (13) . The ability of trauma systems to cope with those increasing volumes under new working environments presents a challenge unique to these times. Safety of theatre staff, theatre turnover times and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f post-operative care capacity are among the aspects that will alter day to day practice (14) . Fracture management needs to be reconsidered in line with the new BOAST guidelines. COVID positive patients have a significant 30-day peri-operative mortality suggesting that only essential surgeries be undertaken in this group(15).\n"," Knowledge also continues to evolve around associated longer term comorbidities in the form of a post COVID-19 syndrome. The musculoskeletal system, as in most viral illnesses, is affected by COVID-19 with a percentage of patient's experience symptoms in the form of myalgias, arthalgias and fatigue. The mechanisms by which the disease produces these symptoms is unknown and an open mind must be given to the possibility of a post COVID-19 syndrome which includes pathology in the musculoskeletal system (16) . Finding a balance in providing an appropriate level of care at a reasonable level of risk to those involved is hugely challenging and consensus statements and algorithms will aid in the optimisation of care (17) .\n"," In the COVID negative cohort, fractures that have a viable delayed treatment, e.g.\n"," later corrective osteotomy in extra-articular distal radius fractures (18) , may need to be de-prioritised to maintain adequate service provision. While making a balanced decision to delay treatment may be required in certain cases, another aspect to consider is the delayed presentation of trauma due to anxieties around attending hospital during a pandemic (19, 20) . The discrepancies in our data between 2019 and 2020 are thought to be based on lower trauma volumes but may be at least partially accounted for by 'hidden trauma'. This phenomenon may place unforeseen demands on reconstructive services at a later date. It is important to acknowledge that the situation will likely remain dynamic through to 2021 and a degree of flexibility in management of trauma systems will be required.\n"," Reduction in elective theatre access will create opportunities for units to re-orient rotas directing specific trauma to the care of more freely available specialists. Our centralised unit created dedicated foot and ankle, hand and wrist, upper limb, hip, and knee lists aimed at ensuring injuries were treated by relevant specialists more frequently compared to pre-COVID-19. This highlights that while significant challenges lie ahead, the current environment will also present opportunities for improvement. We believe that we have created an important blueprint for the reallocation of elective orthopaedic resources for trauma in a crisis environment. We are undoubtedly in a better position to deal with any short-term fluctuations in trauma service demands created by the current pandemic. While we will endeavour to reintroduce elective surgery as expeditiously as possible to our centre to the benefit of thousands of patients awaiting orthopaedic procedures, we will continue to provide an overflow trauma service. Incorporating provisions for a second wave and the continued availability of trauma theatre into the medium term is a key consideration given the short-term unpredictability of the healthcare environment.\n"," Longer term, appropriate foresight around innovations in service provision that are required now can also be used to improve trauma and orthopaedics for the long term.\n"," Trauma and orthopaedic service provision is changing in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with population lockdowns, trauma volumes have dropped and trends in mechanisms have changed. Likewise, volumes and trends will shift once more as countries 're-open' (21) . Jurisdictions must consider how to provide an ( \n","Score: 1.4905023020892592\n","\n","Title: Impact of COVID-19 on carers of children with tracheostomies\n","Body Text: Caregivers of children with tracheostomies must acquire skills in tracheostomy care, such as stoma care 1 to prevent potentially life-threatening complications. 2 Knowledge and confidence in delivering this type of care can be challenging to parents, carers and healthcare professionals alike. 1 3-5 The burden of care placed on carers has been associated with poor quality of life [6] [7] [8] and a negative impact on health status. 9 At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an urgent need to optimise tracheostomy protocols to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with aerosol-generating procedures. 10 In the UK, children with tracheostomies were categorised as high risk and were advised to isolate at home until August 2020. 11 Despite rapid changes in knowledge, [12] [13] [14] there was clinical uncertainty around the vulnerability of children with tracheostomies throughout the early stages of the pandemic. 11 15 National tracheostomy safety project guidance was produced in August 2020 16 (updated January 2021) 17 in response to cautious pandemic-related approaches, such as the exclusion of children educational activities. Further guidance from the British Paediatric Respiratory Society was published in November 2020. 18 This study set out to explore the experiences of caregivers of children with tracheostomies. The impact of COVID-19 emerged as a key theme during early data collection guiding our iterative approach to analysis and is the main focus of this paper.\n"," ► Caring for children with tracheostomies in hospital, community healthcare settings and at home can be challenging. ► There was clinical uncertainty around the vulnerability of children with tracheostomies throughout the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in rapidly evolving guidance. ► At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a need to optimise tracheostomy care protocols to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with aerosol-generating procedures.\n"," ► Our findings describe how the COVID-19 pandemic has presented carers of children with tracheostomies with an additional and, for some, substantial challenge and increased burden. ► We highlight difficulties balancing general pandemic-related restrictions with the delivery of family-centred care and the need to provide consistent evidence-based guidance and support. ► Many of the issues identified in this study will have relevance to carers of children with other complex medical care needs.\n"," Qualitative semistructured interviews (n=34) were undertaken between July 2020 and February 2021 by telephone or video link with a maximal variation purposive sample of health professionals and parents of children with tracheostomies who had attended a tertiary care referral centre in the North East of England. Health professionals were purposively sampled to include variation of accounts in relation to professional roles and healthcare settings, including different levels of experience of providing care for children with tracheostomies. Parents were sampled to include accounts from those with children tracheostomised prior to and during the pandemic and from across the geographical region. Topic guides were developed initially based on key areas from the extant literature and allowed participant-led discussion. Concurrent data collection and analysis allowed refinement of the topic guide based on initial interviews and continued until no new themes were evident with the data (data saturation). Recruitment of further participants ceased on data saturation and therefore this informed our sample size in both groups. Informed consent was obtained. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were anonymised and coded with the help of NVivo QSR International Pty Ltd software V.12, 2018. Exploratory data analysis was conducted iteratively in line with Braun and Clark's six phase approach to reflexive thematic analysis 19 with a focus on the pandemicrelated themes. Interviews and analysis were conducted by an experienced qualitative researcher (NH).\n"," Interviews were completed with 17 parents (15 families) and 17 health professionals and lasted 40-125 min. Participant characteristics are summarised in table 1. Most parents had children with additional complex needs. Two children and their families had tested positive for COVID-19 prior to interview. None were described as having suffered from serious illness as a result.\n"," We describe four key themes relating to carers' experiences of providing tracheostomy care during the pandemic. These interconnected themes are described within the context of the impact on the child, the emotional and physical well-being of carers and the challenges posed in relation to maintaining the values of family-centred care.\n"," Participants' accounts illustrated how the pandemic had required consideration of safety in relation to care environments and the 'new normal' of caregiving specific to COVID-19 transmission and infection risk within the context of tracheostomy care. This influenced how they had adapted to create, normalise and maintain safe environments and care for tracheostomised children in light of evolving knowledge, understanding and guidance. Table 2 provides examples of some key barriers, facilitators and impact associated with this process.\n"," In line with guidelines, ensuring safety involved significant changes such as shielding, the provision of virtual appointments, personal protective equipment (PPE), processes to ensure 'safe routes into hospital' and visitor restrictions. Due to the nature of the COVID-19 threat, and despite recognised challenges, carers generally reported having accepted and quickly adjusted to the changes.\n"," [I]t was a lot of the unknown and anxieties from our part, because you didn't know what you were… really what you were contending with. Then now it feels like the new normal. (HP14) Nevertheless, accounts demonstrated that adherence to generic rules intended to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection and transmission could also conflict with the principles of 'familycentred care', prioritising the complex and individual needs of children and families. This seems to have created a challenging balance for health professionals and parents that fluctuated over the course of the pandemic. Visitor restrictions in hospitals, for example, were reported to have had significant impact on carers and their families.\n"," Although parents recognised that responsibility for maintaining safe healthcare environments was mainly under the control of the health professionals, they felt ultimate responsibility for keeping their child 'safe' more generally across all settings. Particularly for those who had spent a long time in hospital during the pandemic, this resulted in frustration and anger in response to unclear rules and procedures often inconsistently applied across hospital wards and by different staff. For some parents, safety concerns had resulted in hesitancy to seek care for non-life-threatening situations and taking on increasing responsibility for their child's medical needs. This was reported to be context specific, depended on the level of concern and changed over the course of the pandemic I don't care what it is, unless it's an emergency, we're not coming back (to hospital). (P8)\n"," [A] lot of parents were scared, … some parents didn't really want to come to hospital, didn't want anybody from the hospital coming out to them either… because they were concerned you know catching Covid…'. (HP7) For those with established tracheostomies, reliance on support and social and respite care posed an additional challenge to providing a 'safe' care environment at home. This involved complex assessment of risk, based on confusing and fluctuating information and had exacerbated the emotional burden of caring for a child with a life-threatening condition.\n"," You didn't know where you wanted to be for the best really… It was safer for [child's name] at home… and obviously at that time, you don't want them [community nurses/respite carers] in your house but you have to… (P3).\n"," [O]ur concern at the moment isn't so much about [sibling] and [child] getting it… our biggest concern is if [husband] and I catch it, and we're in a position where if we're too poorly to care for the children. We have no contingency, at all. (P19) Despite describing many negative consequences of the pandemic, increased community awareness of infection risk and other social contact restrictions had also allowed some parents to feel more control over keeping their home environments safer for children already at high risk of other respiratory infections\n"," [I]t's been a treat… he hasn't had a chest infection since the very beginning of this year, whereas, I think by now we would have had a lot more. (P11) [P]eople are so much more aware now, there's so much more hand washing, there's so much more masks… Covid, for a respiratory baby, who needs to get through the next few years and grow some lungs… probably not the worst thing that could have happened to him. (P13)\n"," Some of the most significant issues highlighted in relation to the efforts to minimise COVID-19 infection risk and maintain safe spaces were the disrupted support caused by shielding, isolation of parents caused by shielding, visitor restrictions in hospitals and challenges associated with respite care. This affected participants in different ways. Table 3 provides illustrative quotes relating the difficulties and impact on mental health and well-being associated with exacerbation of isolation and lack of social support due to the pandemic.\n"," Hospital visitor restrictions and limited access to usual support from partners and extended family was a particular challenge for those whose children were tracheostomised during the pandemic, as well as those with existing tracheostomies who had spent extended periods of time isolated on hospital wards. When asked about what had been the most difficult aspect of her experience, one mother responded: 'Having to be away from the family (sibling and husband) with my daughter in the hospital' (P14). Nursing staff reported how there had been an increased need to provide emotional support to parents trying to cope on their own with having a seriously ill child. Isolation and disruption to usual support was also an issue for those with children with established tracheostomies at home. Access to suitable respite care and support was described as an ongoing difficulty generally, particularly in relation to funding and availability of experienced home carers. However pandemicrelated restrictions were reported to have further disrupted access to formal (including school-based and health or social care funded support) and informal (extended family and friends) respite care. This was reported to have placed increasing burden on parents to provide 24-hour care with little or no access to support.\n"," Parents described different ways that the need to try to minimise transmission risk to their child and families had impacted on their living arrangements. This evolved throughout the course of the pandemic, but examples included parents living apart for extended periods, so that one parent could continue working, moving in with extended family to access support or restricted contact within the household.\n"," For many of the families, schools provided essential respite care, specialist support such as intensive physiotherapy and met the stimulation and development needs of those children with \n"," additional complex learning needs. Due to initial uncertainty about the transmission risk associated with tracheostomies, access to schools was inconsistent and was still proving to be problematic for many of the families. Lack of access to support and respite care and isolation due to shielding and lockdown restrictions placed increasing pressures on parents' own physical and mental health and well-being, and for those in employment, posed additional challenges around work and financial concerns.\n"," [M]entally that was quite difficult for him that monotony… educationally lost out on quite a bit as well. (P9) '[S]o it's been pretty tough because we both work, me and his dad work, I've had to take unpaid leave and his dad was furloughed due to the COVID-19'.(P3)\n"," The impact of the pandemic on isolation and disruption to everyday life, however, was not always easy to distinguish from 'normal' challenges associated with caring for a tracheostomised child, particularly for those whose child had been tracheostomised during the pandemic or those who already felt isolated.\n"," Although there was a high level of acceptance around pandemicrelated uncertainty and changes, the pandemic seemed to accentuate issues around power, rapport and trust, particularly if these were already strained. Some parents who had spent long periods of time on different hospital wards during the pandemic reported being frustrated by the lack of consistency in interpretation and delivery of the rules and regulations. This impacted on trust and in one case had resulted in a significant breakdown in communication and conflict.\n"," Although most parents were positive about the support they received from healthcare teams, the isolation felt by parents was in contrast to the importance placed on team working and support from colleagues reported by health professionals.\n"," [W]e're getting through it as a team whilst still wanting to deliver, you know, high standards of care to the families we're looking after.\n"," Children with tracheostomies have large multidisciplinary teams to support their care needs. Adaptation had relied on team working, local leadership and problem-solving skills of teams and individuals. An increased reliance on video-conferencing was generally perceived to have had a positive impact on interdisciplinary team working. Technology enabled virtual clinics were reported to offer important advantages for children and parents, particularly those who find the burden of travelling with their child to appointments difficult. However, the sustainability of this approach for families, whose children need to be seen face to face regularly for medical assessment, was questioned, as it could also make parents feel abandoned, threatening trust and valuable relationship building.\n"," It's gonna be really good for moving on in the future when things kind of go back to whatever the new normal will be. (HP6)\n"," [I]f it remains remote, … the thread between them is, is pulled and potentially can weaken and then there's not as much trust and people are more likely to feel abandoned. (HP15) 'I think obviously, at the minute (due to pandemic), you don't have the support around you of the people that you know … it therefore causes overreactions or upset just because it's… you're not thinking as straight as you were if you had somebody else around you to keep your mind sensible… I think mentally, I think it does, I think it, it takes its toll, being separated'. (P13)\n"," 'I think he's received all of the appropriate medical treatment he should have had…, everything was, kind of, full steam ahead. There was no delays with anything. It's more the emotional side, so being on my own when he had his tracheostomy. I was the only one allowed in the PICU* that day to see him. So his dad couldn't see him and then we weren't allowed to be in the same room together. Erm, so we had to swap off the hospital site, which is a bit ridiculous considering anybody can walk in off the street and get a Costa from the hospital, they're the rules. Erm, we weren't allowed to be together'. (P17) *Paediatric intensive care unit The need to wear PPE, in particular face coverings, was also reported to have had an impact on building and developing relationships with the child and family. In the main, most participants reported that they and the children they cared for had adapted quickly to the use of face masks. The inability of children with additional communication needs to see or recognise faces also presented a challenge for rapport and communication (see table 4 ).\n"," Health professionals described a number of adjustments that had been made either at team level, such as including stickers on visors to make staff appear more friendly and recognisable, or at an individual level, taking considered risks and adjusting rules and requirements to ensure rapport building.\n"," Coping with pandemic-related uncertainties presented an additional, and for some substantial, difficulty for parents on top of existing challenges associated with providing 24-hour care for their child and dealing with complex medical equipment and lifethreatening situations. The pandemic was, however, not always seen to be the biggest challenge they faced, in light of the lifechanging experiences and responsibilities associated with having a child with a life-threatening condition. Accounts illustrated high levels of required resilience associated with adapting to the impact the pandemic was having on their own 'new normal' and already disrupted lives.\n"," [I]t's difficult having a child with a life-threatening medical condi-tion… it's hard at the best of times but (pandemic has) made it even more complicated than it probably would have been. (P5) COVID wasn't, isn't the biggest issue happening in [child's] life at the minute. (P8) So, it hasn't massively changed a lot for me because… Before lockdown it was hard for me to do anything. (P2) Uncertainty in relation to the pandemic seemed, however, to have been normalised and accepted due to the unusual context. Parents' narratives were commonly positive and stoic even when describing significant pandemic-associated challenges and impacts on mental health and well-being.\n"," Its (living with Covid) a bit like having a kid with a trache isn't it? You've just got to deal with it. You've got to put measures in place, do the best you can to keep you and your family safe and, that's all you can do. (P5) Health professionals' accounts also displayed rapid normalisation and a degree of stoicism around acceptance and adaptation to changes despite a high level of uncertainty around variable and changing guidance and information. They described a need to balance abiding by new rules and guidance with their own safety and the safety of the child and well-being of the family. This was particularly apparent in light of uncertainty around risks and professional duties of care in life-threatening situations.\n"," [T]o me, she (nurse) did the right thing for my boy, but she didn't do the right thing for COVID, and she didn't do the right thing for A&E, and she didn't do the right thing for herself. (P1) Adaptations to accommodate the needs of families could also place additional burden on staff time and resources with increased need for nurses to support the emotional and mental health needs of parents isolated on hospital wards. Other staff described involvement of health professionals in ensuring children were able to attend school. The need for restrictions, changes in processes and fluctuating information was nevertheless reported to have caused frustration confusion and additional anxiety.\n"," There seemed to be an assumption and burden of responsibility placed on parents to 'know' how to keep their child safe, despite a lack of clarity around how best to do so. Narratives [n]ow we're all wearing masks, we're not even seeing our mouth movements for you know copying those…I think that the frustrating side is that they can't see your mouth and I do find that quite weird sometimes um if you're trying to kind of encourage talking or eating um it does look a bit strange, so that's been frustrating. I know that there are clear masks available… I think they still come with their problems, but, um, you know that might be something to think about going forward'. (HP4)\n"," from health professionals at times highlighted expectations that parents knew what was 'safe' and when clinical assessment was required, extending further the care duties and responsibilities placed on parents prepandemic.\n"," [T]he parents are very sensible, and they don't want to put children at risk, so they'll have been shielding at home. (HP5)\n"," [P]arents would have highlighted any concerns. (HP10)\n"," Reported confidence of the parents was more varied. One parent described how they felt responsible for decisions around help-seeking that might have put their child at risk. I just keep getting told to go to hospital, but I mean can you imagine how stupid I feel rocking up at A&E when it's COVID if it isn't actually anything wrong with him… I'm increasing me risks of catching COVID, never mind [child's name] me and his dad coming to A&E. (P1) It was acknowledged that although the pandemic had affected everyone, there had been an increased burden of responsibility placed on parents of children with tracheostomies and other complex care needs. Some parents also described an increased burden of responsibility for their child's needs and well-being due to the uncertainty and disruption to their usual support mechanisms and respite care arrangements.\n"," [A]t the moment, we're kind of living on a fingers crossed, nothing's really wrong with him. (P9)\n"," [I]t's difficult anyway, COVID is making it harder… (P5)\n"," Our findings describe how pandemic-related reconceptualisation of safe spaces and care practices have exacerbated existing isolation and challenges for many parents and carers. Frustration around inconsistent pandemic-related guidance seems to have placed pressure on trust, communication and relationships, which has been, for some, compounded by PPE requirements. The loss of support and access to respite care for parents were found to have been contextualised in relation to difficulties and uncertainties, resilience and stoicism. There were, however, unanticipated benefits of increased community awareness of respiratory infection risks. We highlight difficulties balancing general pandemic-related restrictions with the delivery of familycentred care. Many of these issues will have relevance to families with children with other complex medical care needs.\n"," A potential limitation of our findings is that parent participation was focused on the experiences of carers of children from one tertiary care centre. Furthermore, we had a limited number of fathers (3/17), so the family responses were biased towards the mothers' perspectives. Only two participants reported that their child and families had tested positive for COVID-19. Potential for comparisons based on these characteristics and experiences was therefore limited. In addition, we had no responses from other formal and informal carers (eg, grandparents, social carers and siblings) and children were not included. We would advocate for the inclusion of a more diverse pool of participants in future studies. Many of the parents described the impact on their employment and financial situations and how the pandemic had exacerbated existing difficulties, mainly due to restricted access to respite care and working parents being furloughed. Our analysis did not specifically compare experiences based on sociodemographic or employment characteristics of parents however, and this may be another area for future research.\n"," Caring for children with medical needs requiring multiple medical procedures and equipment places a significant burden on families. [20] [21] [22] Disease burden has been shown to be higher for children and families with tracheostomies than for other serious childhood diseases and is associated with lower quality of life for carers. 6 7 23 Our findings describe how the pandemic has presented carers with a substantial additional challenge. Nevertheless, in line with existing qualitative evidence describing how the lives of these families can be 'highly complicated and frequently overwhelming' 24 and the associated psychological burden and daily struggle, 8 9 the pandemic was not always seen to be the most significant challenge they faced. The difficulties associated with knowledge and confidence in delivering tracheostomy care, 1 5 25-27 adapting to the transition from hospital to home and coping with the responsibilities of medical care, disrupted lives 3 28 and dealing with care coordination 9 has also been highlighted by others. Narratives from parents and health professionals demonstrated rapid adaptation, normalisation and varying degrees of stoicism and citizenship around constantly changing pandemic-related requirements. These reflect and extend themes of resilience and enrichment in previous qualitative work with carers of children with tracheostomies and other complex medical needs. 23 24 As we move to the next phase of the pandemic, we need to understand the impact on vulnerable groups so that their needs can be prioritised. Levels of anxiety around COVID-19 transmission risk were already starting to reduce nationally near the end of our data collection period. It is possible that as the national vaccination programme, restrictions and shielding advice has evolved, integration within educational settings, access to respite care and other healthcare related challenges may have improved for this group of children and their families. Nevertheless, despite ongoing debate and high levels of COVID-19 in school settings, vaccines are not routinely available for under 12 years in the UK, 29 and there may still be concerns and challenges associated with the risks for vulnerable children in this setting. Staff shortages across social care more widely are likely to also be compounding existing issues in relation to access to appropriate respite care and support. The impact of the pandemic on access to hospice-based and social services funded respite centres were not highlighted in the accounts of our participants but may be of relevance to other families.\n"," The importance of consistent evidence-based guidance, support and interprofessional working across health, social care and education settings has been demonstrated as crucial to helping families and health professionals. Groups such as the British Paediatric Respiratory Society and National Tracheostomy Safety Project have built a body of resources to help provide more consistency. These can form the basis of education and training for staff, parents and other carers in the future.\n","Score: 1.405989653792859\n","\n","Title: Competence vs. Identity, Trainees vs. Physicians: How COVID-19 Has Highlighted Role Confusion in Residency Training Implications for General Residency Training Conditions The recognition of residents entering Identity vs. Role Confusion is important regarding how programs evaluate\n","Body Text: The idea for this paper occurred much prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was supposed to be a more light-hearted and cheekier take on how residents are the \"teenagers\" of medical education: almost grown-up, but not quite. The initial intent was to highlight how sometimes residents are viewed as having all the responsibility of being full-grown \"adult\" doctors, while at other times needing to be protected and/or controlled, enjoying very few privileges of autonomous physicians. The COVID-19 pandemic and response have obviously required swift changes to medical education, but have only further highlighted the mixed messaging and treatment that U.S. residents face during training.\n"," Prior to COVID-19, almost the entirety of this paper was going to be an examination of Erik Erickson's Psychosocial Stages of Development [1] , how they relate to educational level, and whether a competency-based evaluation system is sufficient for individuals who are also starting professional identity formation. I will try to do this briefly, then move on to how the current COVID-19 crisis has served to amplify these points for psychiatry residents.\n"," Erickson was a child psychoanalyst who developed a list of psychosocial stages, where each stage represents \"an unavoidable encounter between the environment and the developing person who is driven by instinctual energy and developing awareness\" and results in a corresponding \"crisis\" that needs to be navigated to resolve the conflict [2] . The crisis or conflict of Erickson's 4th stage is Industry vs. Inferiority, the successful navigation of which leads to the virtue of competence. Competency-based evaluations have become commonplace in medical schools and residency training programs [3, 4] .\n"," Although this has led to improved consistency across schools and programs on how students and trainees are evaluated, the risk of students and residents not being able to successfully navigate this stage cannot be ignored. Competition among medical school classmates to prove their superiority over each other for coveted positions in medical honor societies and residency positions has led to such detrimental perfectionism and increased stress levels that many medical schools have made the pre-clinical curriculum pass/fail [4] . This sense of competition and fear of inferiority can also mark this stage and partly explains why in typical development, self-esteem takes a dip in middle childhood [5] -and perhaps medical school.\n"," Although residency training still focuses on competency and skill development, residents have already started to embark on the next stage. Residents need to fulfill the expectations that are eventually required to be called a \"surgeon,\" \"psychiatrist,\" or \"radiologist.\" It is not just mastery of skills for a sense of industry, but specific knowledge, attitudes, and values of which they must demonstrate sufficient acquisition in order to fulfill the obligations of the professional identity of their specialty. These attributes are not attained merely by proving superiority over each other, but rather by learning from faculty role models. It would appear residency training also incorporates Erickson's 5th stage, Identity Formation/Cohesion vs. Role Confusion, typically marked in adolescence [1] . This is not an indictment on the lack of emotional maturity of residents and fellows; ample research has already shown that psychological \"adolescence\" is lasting longer nowadays than in the past [6] and that protracted education can lead to prolonged adolescence and identify formation [7] . Erickson's theories have already been used to describe latelife transitions in medical specialty or transition between practice and academia [2] .\n"," The recognition of residents entering Identity vs. Role Confusion is important regarding how programs evaluate and treat residents during residency training, as according to Erickson it is the environment that creates the unavoidable conflict the individual must navigate. Even outside of COVID-19, residents often receive mixed messages about their role in training programs and medical education, highlighting the role confusion of adolescence. Residents are expected to be professionals and develop an altruistic attitude towards their patients and colleagues and are often expected to take on the responsibilities of autonomous physicians. Yet it is also recognized that residents and fellows are a group that requires special protections, such as the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education's (ACGME) 80-h limit [8] , as without such protections trainees may be taken advantage of or mistreated [9] . Trainees also lack privileges attained by post-graduate physicians such as financial compensation or ability to negotiate, or flexibility with job requirements, mandatory attendance of didactics, and limited availability of sick leave or child-care. In these aspects, trainees are treated more like children who require special protections and are only granted limited flexibility and autonomy [10] .\n"," It is possible, and even likely, that these shifting views are often alternated based on what serves the needs of the environment-training programs and hospital systems-and not necessarily what serves residents needs for growth and development. Residents may be viewed as \"physicians\" if they are asked to provide clinical services without appropriate supervision or to exceed work hour restrictions, but may be viewed as \"trainees\" in regard to justifying their low salary, having a limited say in training requirements, and inability to negotiate benefits. Such shifting views may be psychologically detrimental to trainees' professional identity development, as trainees may understand their role as only being of specific use to a training program or hospital, which can vary from place to place. This would add to Role Confusion, rather than Identity Formation/Cohesion.\n"," The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to the dual role of residents and fellows as both trainees and physicians [11] , and this identity crisis is much more pressing and urgent within the backdrop of the COVID-19 crisis. Three specific issues will be reviewed below, namely (1) the need for protection;\n"," (2) professional identity development; and (3) financial compensation.\n"," The American Medical Association (AMA) acknowledges that certain stressors of the pandemic are \"unique\" to residents due \"to their status as employed trainees\" [12] . The AMA has noted that many physicians-in-training will be \"enlisted\" or \"deployed\" to provide direct patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they must be protected and have support to maintain safety [13] . These militaristic terms imply that this process may be only semi-voluntary at best, as residents have limitations in autonomy and flexibility [14] . This is as opposed to autonomous physicians, who are allowed to \"volunteer\" their services [15] . In contrast, residents have feared that their \"deployment\" may actually lead to delays in their graduation if such work was not felt to contribute to graduation requirements (the AMA has opposed this stance) [12] . Autonomous \"volunteers\" would inherently have no such risk. A reading of the AMA's Guiding Principles to Protect Residents and Fellows During the COVID-19 Crisis [12] only further serves to highlight how such rights as the ability to raise concerns without recrimination, be actively engaged in response planning, and continue to be paid during sick leave, must be explicitly stated to be given to residents, as if otherwise they may be taken away, similar to the rationale for the United Nations Convention on the Right of the Child [10] .\n"," The AMA acknowledges that since the start of the COVID-19, residents have been pulled from their primary role to cover other services [16] , noting that \"many residents are being asked to assume roles that are not a prescribed part of their specialty training\" [12] . The AMA goes on to acknowledge that \"residents may be compelled to acquire skills on the job that were not an expectation when they began residency\" [12] . Although they may be developing other skills necessary to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and aside from fear of contracting the viral infection, there is implied fear related to developmental delays in their professional identity in their chosen specialty.\n"," On the other end of the spectrum, subspecialty fellows have been asked to serve in attending physician roles in their core disciplines [12] . This could be seen as an early or inappropriate increase in responsibility, although appropriate privilege may be lacking, without a commensurate increase in their compensation and malpractice coverage. Likewise, it is hinted that such activity-likely only made to benefit a specific's program acute needs in this crisis-may lead to said program viewing this service as negatively impacting their completion of the training program, which \"must be openly discussed with them\" [12] . This is again, Role Confusion, in which a trainee may be simultaneously told they are \"competent\" enough to act like an attending in service of a program, but in fact a program may use this to harm or delay their professional development in their core discipline, both views that would serve a program at the potential detriment to trainees.\n"," Even prior to the COVID-19, residents in various parts of the U.S.A. had recently banded together to demand more favorable financial compensation [17] . Resident salaries are low compared to those of other health care workers, particularly on an hourly basis, and may only equate to approximately $15 to $20/h [12] . Fully autonomous physicians have the ability to negotiate contracts, or quit/resign and look for more competitive positions, not residents. Residents are particularly vulnerable in their negotiating ability as a labor force. Although they are employed health care workers, their dual status as \"trainees\" makes them dependent upon their employer for their professional development [12] . As such, \"their influence over the environment … is limited,\" [12] a statement which is often applied to why children and young people also require special protections [10] .\n"," Due to being involuntarily reassigned, some residents have demanded hazard pay in order to ensure financial compensation [18] . The AMA has supported such measures, stating residents \"should be candidates for hazard pay in a way that is equitable to other health care workers,\" as well as granted forgiveness and/or forbearance for their student loan debt to ease the financial stress during the COVID-19 crisis [14] . Perhaps it is no coincidence that the very program that attracted the most attention for a pre-COVID residency strike advocating for equal pay and benefits was the same program post-COVID that was lauded by the AMA for protecting its residents during the crisis [19] .\n"," There have been multiple reports and first-hand accounts of psychiatry residents being re-deployed to cover other services, especially during the initial stages of the pandemic [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , including working in ICUs and COVID units [22, 23] . One program from New York re-deployed all 13 of their PGY-2 psychiatry residents to cover COVID units [20] . A previous publication in this journal detailed the accounts of a rural program that reassigned psychiatry interns to internal medicine services, with one PGY-5 who was also completing a Preventative Medicine program being put in a position to help to coordinate their states' COVID response [21] . Another psychiatry program from New York detailed that of 46 total residents in their program, the first to be re-deployed were interns, assumingly mandatory, and volunteers from the PGY-4 class; when all was said and done, 35 of the 46 residents had experienced re-deployment [23] . One report from a PGY-3 psychiatry resident who \"volunteered\" to work on an internal medicine COVID unit wrote positively about the experience, and also acknowledged facing their own mortality and having to write their will before being deployed [24] .\n"," A common theme appears to be of forced deployment to front-line work of residents in the earlier years of training, interns, and PGY-2s, while upper-levels were initially afforded the option of avoiding being the first wave of responders. This may be at least partially due to the perception that upper-levels had already experienced growth into their professional identity, despite also likely having more competence. One author noted the altering of \"the trajectory of my medical training\" and \"being asked to step off my planned career path and return to my general medicine foundations [20] .\" This strongly hints at the perception of an arrest of growth during identity formation and needing to regress to an earlier, less well-differentiated period. Interns and lowerlevels may be perceived as less well-differentiated psychiatrists with less autonomy and were felt to be more malleable to fit the acute needs of programs and hospital systems. Yet it is equally confusing to the role of a PGY-5 who was tasked with helping to organize the COVID-19 response of an entire state, which is perhaps beyond the competence of a pregraduate physician.\n"," These issues are intricately related to the perceived role of residents, whether they are \"trainees\" or \"physicians\" or both. It may be helpful to acknowledge this dual and sometimes conflicting role, to help trainees and attendings make sense and understand where incidents of Role Confusion may lead to conflict in training programs. Such an understanding may lead to improved communication, problem-solving, and attachment, which would be particularly beneficial during a crisis. Implications include both potentially under-and overestimating the expectations of trainees, and in fact these probably alternate in a way that penalizes residents. This discrepancy existed prior to COVID-19, but the pandemic has only further highlighted this mixed view, which needs to be examined to avoid potentially disastrous consequences.\n"," According to Erickson, the virtue associated with successfully navigating Identity vs. Role Confusion is fidelity, which he defined as \"the ability to sustain loyalties freely pledged in spite of the inevitable contradictions of value systems\" [25] . Fidelity is marked by loyalty and commitment and allows young people to choose or reject major roles they could assume. Erickson believed that successful resolution of the psychosocial crisis of adulthood-Generativity vs. Stagnationrequires that individuals be capable of exhibiting loyalty and commitment to \"occupational choices, various ideologies, and to the nurturance and socialization of younger generations\" [25] . Failure to attain this virtue may contribute to \"occupational instability\" and perhaps-in our language-burnout.\n"," An explicit discussion of these discrepancies may lead to greater understanding and Identity Formation/Cohesion, both for individual residents and for training programs. Recommendations for training programs could include:\n"," & Have honest and transparent discussions about the role of residents & Acknowledge discrepancies and disparities in role perception that affect residents negatively, particularly during crises & Recognize that residents, as a group, require special protections and rights and ensure those protections and rights are granted & Recognize that residents are growing in autonomy and provide developmentally appropriate independence and autonomy & Distinguish evaluations based on competence from markers of appropriate professional identity formation & Treat residents consistently and in line with their appropriate developmental stage\n"," Disclosures The author states that there is no conflict of interest.\n"," Disclaimer I am currently a faculty member in a Child Psychiatry training program and thus may have biases related to the content of the paper regarding the role of residents in training programs. The acknowledgement of that potential bias is the point of the paper.\n","Score: 1.3508824534020092\n","\n","Title: Establishing Singapore as the Events and Entertainment Capital of Asia: Strategic Brand Diversification\n","Body Text: Contained within Singapore Tourism Board's (STB) vision for tourism 2015 is the stated intention to establish Singapore as the ' Events and Entertainment Capital of Asia ' . This strategy is part of wider economic development agency attempts to diversify Singapore's brand beyond its well established reputation as a leading business destination. The city wants to capture the attention of global tourism markets by redefining itself as a vibrant cultural hub with an events and entertainment offering to rival some of the world's most attractive cities. This strategy can be viewed as a response to the intensification of global place wars for attention which have increased the pressure on destinations the world over to create unique attractions to entice valuable mobile capital. This chapter provides a critical overview of the global context for inter-urban place wars before focusing on the value of an events-led strategy in delivering competitive advantage for Singapore. Methodologically, it draws on elite interviews with leading Singaporean cultural policy makers, observations at local, national and international events and documentary analysis of the recent strategic environment for Singapore tourism. We contend that the city branding and place-making strategies employed by the Singaporean state apparatus are designed to create cultural strategies which ensure the gentrification of space and place necessary for the reception of global tourism inflows. In essence, we suggest that Singapore has used its events-led strategies to extend its internal processes of cultural planning, regeneration and development at the same time as securing a global position in the increasingly competitive events (and place) bidding wars. events (or culture)-led strategies in establishing competitive advantage for cities within the global economy. Hall (2006) , reflecting on the growth of sports mega-events, argues that neoliberal entrepreneurial growth strategies are now regularly played out by cities around the world. In Zukin's (1995) words, culture is increasingly the ' business of cities ' , an ' instrument in the entrepreneurial strategies of local governments and business alliances ' (p. 12) . In urban environments across Europe, the Americas and Asia, public and private growth coalitions come together to utilise events and festivals as a means of gaining competitive advantage in increasingly aggressive place wars ( Haider, 1992 ; Short and Kim, 1999; Yeoh and Chang, 2001) with other aspiring global cities. These place wars are driven by the need to create a favourable image to tourism, migration and business marketplaces. Increasingly, sporting and other cultural festivals and events represent particularly attractive communication vehicles for cities as they interact with the globalised media complex and vie for the attention of policy makers, consumers and investors, alike. In the competition for attention ( Goldhaber, 1997 ) , places seek out means of differentiation and distinction; unique qualities which can attract valuable mobile capital to advance their economic standing. The decision to engage in city event branding of this sort is almost always politically motivated, rather than cultural or even economic. Today, cities are under pressure to be seen to be bidding for sporting mega-events or to create large scale festivals so that they maintain position in the rankings of top global cities (Shoval, 2002) .\n"," However, exploiting the cultural cache of festivals and events is not the only (or even the most popular) means for cities to secure attention. Richards and Wilson (2004) suggest that branding the built urban environment with signature or iconic buildings and cultural quarters is perhaps the most frequently used means of altering perceptions of a locale. Yet, regenerative strategies based on the transformation of the builtscape ( Chang and Huang, 2005 ) suffer from the threat of homogeneity and serial monotony ( Harvey, 1989 ) which has afflicted other destinations. Moreover, in the fastpaced global economy, an over-reliance on inflexible, physical spaces of regeneration can leave destinations vulnerable to changing architectural fashions and ambitious competitors. In contrast, events and festivals ' provide a means of adding flexibility to fixed structures, supplying a source of spectacle which adds to the image value of a landmark ' ( Richards and Wilson, 2004 , pp. 1931 -1932 , or of a destination. Events are an attractive proposition for policy makers because they animate objects, they enliven the physical environment and, in their uniquely media-friendly form, they transcend geographical boundaries. Using Chang and Huang's (2005) terminology, the creation of ' eventscapes ' also allows places to produce new symbolic (often contrived) meanings, catering for ' new lifestyle needs ' (p. 276) . For example, reflecting on the regeneration of the Singapore River, they argue that a process of ' creative destruction ' has taken place whereby the neoliberal ideological policy of the city has transformed the environment into ' an image of leisure and entertainment at the waterfront, at the expense of landscapes of past economic and social ills ' (p. 279).\n"," Investing in, and creating, festivals and events is doubly attractive to semi-peripheral cities and states ( Whitson and Horne, 2006 ) as they can use these spectacles to establish themselves on the world map. These events can also give others the impression that a city has an achievement and entrepreneurial orientation, informing potential suitors (e.g. investors) that political leaders are enterprising ( Whitson and Horne, 2006 ) . Festivals and events permit semi-peripheral, or regional powers, to showcase their offerings through the global media to a watching audience, influencing perceptions of place identity -both externally (to the possessors of circulating capital) and internally (to members of the host population).\n"," The strategies discussed thus far only bear fruit because cities now operate in a fluid symbolic realm, where image enhancement carries a value; where the hosting of unique events helps cities express their ' personalities ' and advertise their position on the global stage ( Essex and Chalkley, 1998 ) . Sporting and cultural events also fit with the dominant logic of consumption, providing a ' point of identification ' ( Richards and Wilson, 2004, p. 1932 ) for consumers in a crowded marketplace. In discussing place images and their relationship with events, Richards and Wilson argue that ' events have become a particular valuable form of cultural currency ' (p. 1933) creating a favourable impression of the city or nation as a destination worth visiting. The proliferation of cultural and sporting festivals can be associated with, and supports, similar trends towards a cosmopolitan ethic which defines a neighbourhood or city as vibrant. When contrived or manufactured events are hosted, the façade of the city is invariably dressed is such a way as to communicate specific impressions to target audiences. Events are invariably located in gentrified spaces (or in places which are undergoing gentrification processes) and help choreograph forms of cultural consumption which fit with how the city wishes to be perceived, and with the values of those people it wishes to attract (principally the incoming visitor).\n"," The visual representation of cities is particularly valuable in the dominant symbolic realm of inter-urban place marketing competition. Festivals and events provide city marketers with a plethora of suitable vibrant, colourful and multicultural images which are easily packaged for global circulation. Sydney has its Mardi Gras, Rio exploits the Carnival and London uses Notting Hill Carnival to represent the city in a suitably cosmopolitan way. The process often involves recreating a sanitised historical narrative ( Chang and Huang, 2005 ) , one that the governing agencies can utilise to secure the consent of the host population and which is also, crucially, exploitable as a tourism resource. Internationally renowned festivals, such as Notting Hill Carnival, were often created to address the threat posed by social unrest and riots and were targeted towards a particular ethnic minority group. Today, however, these events are invariably used as a clever marketing tool for civic leaders to showcase their destinations ' cultural diversity. Political decision makers in cities such as Rio and New Orleans have continually reinvented their festivals by globalising local celebrations and selling them as unique attractions via global media networks.\n"," Behind many city event-led strategies sit entrepreneurial governments seeking to attract circulating capital ( Schimmel, 2006 ) which brings the ' footloose consumption ' (Short and Kim, 1999, p. 39) of tourists and conventions to their destinations. In the 1980s and early 1990s, US downtowns were transformed into packaged landscapes ( Boyer, 1992 ) with cultures of consumption being defined by spectacularised urban space ( Hannigan, 1998 ; Harvey, 1989 ) . This format for urban growth is now replicated across the world, with cultural consumption at its core. In developing major festival and events strategies, cities tend to work to a common denominator in respect of the markets being courted. These tend to be high spending tourists, middle-class professionals and potential investors. However, the beneficiaries of these event-led strategies are not always those people to whom the city leaders are democratically accountable. It is to the politics of event-led growth that we now turn.\n"," Of course, in the competition for favourable city status there are invariably winners and losers. As Hall (2006) contends, pursuing a major events strategy may well produce lucrative short term gains for private interests (e.g. construction firms, advertisers or sponsors), but this can bring more negative long term consequences for other public stakeholders. This view is supported by the work of Smith (2002) , MacLeod (2002) and others who consider the changing urban policy landscape to be defined by a dominant neoliberal logic in central and local government towards urban entrepreneurialism subsidised by the public purse, which leaves some stakeholders disempowered from decisionmaking processes and from the promulgated economic rewards.\n"," As control over content and promotion is handed over to multinational conglomerates -the driving force for many large scale events -cities and nations also risk alienating the citizens who are identified as the main beneficiaries. Once sponsors have a stake in an event, the presentation of place for target market consumption is more difficult to manage and control. Hall (2006) identifies the problem as being about a perceived democratic deficit, whereby local citizens are disempowered from their rights in the furtherance of a large scale events policy. Alongside Whitson and Horne (2006) , Zukin (1995) and Richards and Wilson (2004) , Hall (2006) asserts that the dominant discourse of capital accumulation provides an ' ideological justification for place-competitive re-imaging strategies ' (p. 64), and a ' competitiveness hegemony ' (p. 64), which places the logic of capital central to policy discussions and decisions. Gray (2007) labels this the commodification of cultural policy, where decisions on investment in forms of cultural expression are made with economic logic in mind.\n"," In pursuing an events-led regeneration strategy as a means of escaping ' routine identities ' ( Richards and Wilson, 2004, p. 1932 ) , cities also face the threat of reinforcing sameness and cultural uniformity, in creating a ' homogenised uniqueness ' . Furthermore, in following a strategy of creating international (or global) events for touristic consumption, the sharp contrast between the host population and the affluent tourist tribes ( Schimmel, 2006 ) being targeted by city governments may also be thrown into view. For example, Judd (1999) , commenting on the fallout from an overemphasis on attracting tourist dollars in the United States, warns that the islands of affluence created often hide the real material deprivation and cultural exclusion faced by some host residents.\n"," Cultural and sporting events have also been employed as a means of addressing the tensions associated with multiculturalism ( Zukin, 1995 ) expressed in the promotion of ' local ' ethnic uniqueness (Chang, 1999 ). Yet, this again can be understood as an intentional policy response to the threat posed by global (read standardised) culture, using cultural diversity as an instrumental tool to attain non-cultural aims and objectives ( Gray, 2007 ) . The symbolic realm ( Zukin, 1995 ) -a realm of images, signs and spaces in cities -permits the creation of collective identity forms, albeit one frequently mediated by the relationship between ' cultural symbols and entrepreneurial capital ' ( Zukin, 1995, p. 3 ) .\n"," In implementing an events-led strategy with the discourse of enterprise at its core, debate over the appropriate use of contested public space is also brought to the fore. The loss of public space free from the logic of consumption is an issue which has attracted the attention of academic commentators and anti-globalisation prophets in recent years (see Klein, 2001 ; Zukin, 1995 ) . They argue that civic spaces are now colonised by private capital (e.g. sponsors), often at the bequest of the public authorities. There are a number of problems associated with this development when considered in relation to festivals and events and their projected tourism returns. First, as invented or contrived cultural events and festivities colonise civic space (e.g. squares, main avenues) the outcome can be the production of intensely regulated, or gated, communities identified by the presence of security barriers, security guards and the ubiquity of CCTV cameras. Regulatory control over licences, traffic management, environmental pollution and the like ensure that the civic authorities and their (growth) coalition partners can easily manage the cultural offering to produce ' safe ' spaces for tourist consumption. However, this can leave the impression of a public culture controlled and contained, managed and directed for the benefit of the footloose consumer. The implications of what Gray (2007) calls an acceptance of a commodified conception of public policy is that collective space is re-conceptualised as consumable space. In focusing on the Singaporean context for events and festivals over the last decade, the empirical component of this chapter will now review critically the implications of the nation's drive towards the title of ' Events and Entertainment Capital of Asia ' .\n"," Since gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, the Singaporean government's main aim has been to maintain stability in the areas of economic and environmental development. At the same time, the government has also continued with its drive to reinforce a discourse of national identity through the development of cultural policies based on the promotion of Singapore's shared values. Politically, whilst the city-state is a democracy, the People's Action Party (PAP) has been the only ruling power since it took over the reigns from the colonial governor. Singapore does have a representative democracy and has official United Nations ' recognition as a parliamentary republic. Despite being small in physical size, Singapore has a high population density of approximately 4.5 million people which in the 2000 Census encompassed a multi-ethnic mix of Chinese 76.8%, Malay 13.9%, Indian 7.9% and others 1. 4% ( www.singstat.com , 2007) .\n"," As a post-colonial power, Singapore has invested heavily in creating a sense of national identity, often using the vehicle of cultural events as a means of integrating the diverse multi-ethnic population along the lines of shared Singaporean values (e.g. National Day celebrations). Indeed, in Singapore, the debate over the need for a strong sense of national identity started at independence from British colonial rule ( Kong, 1999 ) . This movement strengthened in the 1980s and 1990s as part of a larger nation building initiative. The PAP's authoritarian regime ( Tamney, 1996 ) , at least in the first three decades of independent rule, promoted a discourse of national survival and the protection of Asian values in the face of the challenge posed by perceived Western decadence. However, as Singapore rapidly industrialised, the focus of government policy shifted from ' protection ' and the cultivation of shared national values, to the promotion and encouragement of inward investment in entrepreneurial growth strategies. The success of this strategy is illustrated by Singapore's position as the most economically successful country in South East Asia ( Ooi, 2002 ) . Singapore's rapid industrialisation in the 1970s and 1980s was based on the authoritarian regimes ' tight regulation and exploitation of shared national values of hard work and nation before community. However, as strong economic returns were amassed, the attention of government and citizens alike turned from necessity to luxury; from work to leisure and consumption. Through the 1990s and into the new millennium, the government has had to re-evaluate its authoritarian approach as its working population reflect upon the sacrifices made in the name of economic growth. In policy terms the government has created heritage spaces and other ' places to play ' (Judd, 1999) whilst, at the same time, maintaining a ' hegemonic ' control over their population.\n"," However, in recent years, Singapore has also sought to exploit its popularity as a travel destination, even in the face of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis early in the new millennium. Despite this crisis, tourism has evolved into one of its largest industries, with around 9.7 million tourist visits in 2006. The Singaporean government has set a target of at least 17 million visitor arrivals by 2015. The Orchard Road district is the central retail hub in Singapore but, until recently, the city has suffered from a relatively low attractions base. However, this has been addressed by the tourism authorities and the Urban Redevelopment Authority over the past few years. These agencies have been involved in the development of two integrated resorts at Marina South and Sentosa Island, alongside the Singapore Flyer, the Gardens by the Bay, the Singapore River development and the construction of the Double Helix Bridge connecting tourist attractions in and around the packaged landscape of Marina Bay. Whilst the ' builtscapes ' ( Chang and Huang, 2005 ) have been markedly enhanced, this has gone hand-in-hand with the development of the accompanying ' eventscapes ' ( Chang and Huang, 2005 ) . The Great Singapore Sales, Singapore Food Festival, the Singapore River Hong Bao Festival, the Singapore Arts Festival and the Chingay Parade represent opportunities to promote Singapore to regional and international markets. Add to this sporting events, like the Singapore Masters, the Singapore Marathon and the F1 Grand Prix (due to visit Singapore in 2008 for the first time) , and it is clear that Singapore is following a well-trodden path towards the use of events and other cultural forms as valuable commodities worth packaging and selling to the rest of Asia and, increasingly, to wider tourism markets.\n"," In many respects, Singapore has invested in its creative and cultural offering as much out of necessity as of choice. This need is driven by the fact that there are scant natural resources in this island nation, due to its small land mass and high population density. Unlike Korea and Taiwan, Singapore does not have ship building or agricultural activities on which to generate economic growth. However, the ruling party seized the opportunity to use ' cultural maintenance ' to both exercise power over the people and form new markets ( Miller and Yudice, 2002 ) . From the late 1990s onwards, the Singaporean state, through its vehicles of economic development (the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Singaporean Tourism Board), has pursued an ambitious strategy to attract global tourism spend by re-branding Singapore as more than a business travel destination. In recent campaigns, Singapore has been labelled a ' global arts city ' , ' uniquely Singapore ' , an ' eventful city ' and, most recently, the ' Events and Entertainment Capital of Asia ' . It is the final label, the Events and Entertainment Capital of Asia that will occupy our attention in the remainder of this chapter.\n"," In the furtherance of this study on the event and festival strategies being utilised in the promotion of Singapore as a tourist destination, a mixed methods case study approach was employed as it ' allows an investigation to retain the holistic and meaningful characteristics of real-life events ' ( Yin, 1994, p. 3 ). Yin (1994) argues that the benefit of employing a case study approach in the contextual situation of the studied phenomena is integrated into the mode of enquiry, thereby permitting the relationship between context and phenomena to be delineated.\n"," The research strategy underpinning this chapter took two main forms. The substantive phase of fieldwork was gathered by members of the research team during a field trip to Singapore in February 2004. Elite semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from statutory and non-statutory bodies drawn from the tourist sector, from cultural institutions and from enterprise organisations. Interviews were held with individuals from the National Arts Council (2), National Heritage Board (1), Singapore Tourism Board (1), Singapore Sports Council (1) and the International Festival and Events Association (1). The research team intentionally selected interviewees who were in a position to make meaningful comment on strategic issues pertaining to events and festival policy in Singapore, whether in the arts or in sport. Each interviewee was asked questions around key themes concerning the rationale for investment in festivals and events and the policy outcomes sought. Themes included:\n"," • The perception of events and festivities in the tourism product of Singapore now and in the future. • The strategy to make Singapore the Events and Entertainment Capital of Asia.\n"," • The sensitivity of multi-racial diversity issues in promoting events and festivals to tourist audiences. • Placing Singapore on a global map and the importance of local cultural heritage in that positioning. • The role of sports and arts events in making Singapore into a global player for the events sector.\n"," • The marketing of Singapore as the bridge between the East and the West for international events. • The role of local events in forming Singaporean cultural identity and the promotion of this globally.\n"," Given the three-year time lag since the completion of the elite interviews, an extensive desk-based research phase was also undertaken in 2007 to provide an update on the Singaporean context and to investigate the policy rationale behind a significant intensification in Singapore's pursuit of an eventsled strategy since 2004. Documentary analysis was carried out on a number of strategy documents pertaining to economic and tourism policy and on press coverage relating to several of Singapore's renowned cultural and sporting events. The documentary analysis eschewed content analysis techniques in favour of discourse analysis. The former is a quantitative and scientific approach which focuses on the ' direct, deterministic and unilinear link ' within documents, ' from sender to communication to recipient ' ( Jupp and Norris, 1993, p. 38 ) . However, in evaluating the contents of government policy and strategy, it is more meaningful to consider the status of ' official ' documents as socially constructed entities. That withstanding, documents are subject to multiple interpretations both temporally and spatially. For this chapter, a more qualitative, discourse analysis of strategy and policy documents was undertaken, taking into consideration the distinctive political and economic context of Singapore at the time of their publication. When considered alongside the views of the elite interviewees -the ' local interactional context ' ( Flick, 1999, p. 198 ) -a more thorough evaluation of strategic rhetoric and local realities can be accessed.\n"," Leisure and tourism markets represent key strands in STB's strategy to create a unique Destination Singapore brand identity that complements its well established reputation as a leading business destination. The STB has a professed aspiration to establish Singapore as the ' Events and Entertainment Capital of Asia ' (STB, 2007) , attracting ' a big variety of the world's best events year round for visitors to enjoy ' . Working in tandem with the principal economic development agency, the Ministry for Trade and Industry (MITA), the STB provides public subsidy and expert support to incentivise cultural and sporting festivals and events to attract tourist expenditure.\n"," This approach is in line with the city's long term goal of competing on a global level, and in presenting itself as safe Asia ( Foley et al., 2007 ) offering sanitised, hyper Asian experiences alongside dominant Western ideologies of consumption. Events and festivals have become a key plank of the city's global strategy to communicate, or present, an alternative Singaporean identity to the rest of the world. Chang and Huang (2005) suggest that the Singaporean authorities are pursuing a strategy of ' forgetting to remember ' , a ' strategic undertaking that streamlines the past in ways that are coherent to the present and profitable for the future ' (p. 267). Chang and Yeoh (1999) also suggest that Singapore's cultural landscapes are repackaged as marketable commodities. In the case of Singapore's events-led strategy, the ' profitable future ' is build around increasing tourism spend and in creating favourable impressions of Singapore as a distinctive destination to visit -a destination which is progressive and sophisticated, yet still an expression of the Asian soul (e.g. the New Asia marketing campaign). That it is a strategic undertaking that is evidenced in the level of g overnment support which some showcase events receive, whether that be in the arts and cultural area or in relation to large sports events. In many cities government support is forthcoming because of the projected international tourism returns accruable from events, but in recent years Singapore has deliberately altered its strategy to limit the number of events it invests in. As the Singapore Director of the International Festivals and Events Association (IFEA) acknowledges:\n"," Our strategy is now to improve on developing quality in world class activities that have got tourism appeal (Wong, 4 February 2004, interview) .\n"," In developing events with tourism appeal, the place marketers encourage the promotion of activities which Ooi (2002) argues falsify time and place; events without a past but with an exploitable future. These events overlook some elements of the rich cultural heritage of the city, in favour of marketable commodities. The promotion of what Chang and Yeoh (1999) call inauthentic products is apparent in Singapore's recent successful attempt to attract one of the world's most lucrative transportable sporting events the F1 Grand Prix to its streets in 2008. This event promises to be the first ever night race, designed specifically to exploit television audiences in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Singapore government expects tourism revenues of £33 million from the event (MTI, 2007) ; however, the direct economic benefits are only a small part of the overall strategic rationale for hosting the event in Singapore's recently redeveloped marina area. The principal strategic driver is to re-position Singapore as a leisure and tourism destination in the minds of existing and new markets.\n"," In the intensely competitive Asian region, Singapore is adopting a strategy of urban entrepreneurialism, competitiveness and growth ( Hall, 2006 ) . Driven by its agencies of economic development, the Singaporean state has engaged in a place-competitive re-imaging strategy intended to produce a ' vibrant global city that is abuzz with high quality entertainment and events ' (MITA, 2007) . To further emphasise the strategic importance of this flagship event to the city, the STB has made a commitment to fund 60% of the costs from a Tourism Development Fund, complementing private investments. This represents an example of public and private growth coalitions working in tandem to showcase an area's unique facilities and attractions, as a means of gaining valuable coverage in the global media complex.\n"," Singapore's events-related investment is not, however, restricted to the realm of mediasport events. The arts and cultural field is also following what Gray (2007) calls a commodified conception of public policy, the instrumental use of culture for non-cultural outcomes in its adoption of flagship arts events (e.g. Singapore Arts Festival) to promote Singapore to a watching global audience. As the Director of Programme Development at the National Arts Council suggests:\n"," Our mission is to develop Singapore into a global arts city. So that's the way we are and so creating these events will help to put us on the world map … that sense of positioning ourselves and how we make strategic positioning of Singapore … how we can use the arts to give Singapore an identity and an image which I think reflects us (Lee, 4 February 2004, interview) .\n"," Much of the strategic rhetoric in Singaporean policy is concerned with creating distinction within an increasingly competitive global marketplace, capitalising on a (constructed) shared heritage, unravelled cultural diversity and outstanding infrastructural hardware. As the Director of Special Projects at the STB indicates:\n"," We would use events as a main hook, a main magnet -we have to differentiate ourselves … so what we look for as strategy for Singapore is events. It is events which actually leaven what you call the bread. The bread could be baking with shopping, with a lot of lifestyle activities, but it is events which have a fantastic pulling power (Khor, 6 February 2004, interview) .\n"," Singapore is certainly using ' unique ' events to attract attention from key markets as a means of increasing its levels of tourist visitation towards its 2012 target of doubling visitor arrivals to 15 million a year (Tourism Working Group Report, 2005) . The government's investment in attracting large scale regional and international sports events (e.g. Singapore Open Golf, Lexus Cup Golf, Singapore Masters Golf, AVIVA Singapore Open Badminton, Singapore Marathon) has recently been supported by the construction of the Singapore Sports Hub, the ' hardware ' (Wong, 4 February 2004, interview) , which is described as ' A unique cluster development of integrated world-class sports facilities within the city … it will play a critical role in accelerating the development of the sports industry ' (Singapore Sports Council, 2007) . Singapore clearly wishes to enhance its level of status and prestige, giving visitors a reason to identify with the city. As the STB Chief Executive, Lim Neo Chian, illustrates with respect to the Grand Prix, Singapore wants to position itself as a place to ' be in and be seen in ' (STB press release, 2007) . This further reinforces Richards and Wilson's (2004) view of the cultural currency of events in creating a favourable impression of the city or nation as a desirable destination. In referring to the importance of the Chingay festival in promoting Singapore to external markets, the Director of IFEA emphasises the:\n"," Marketing value of this event being broadcast in Portugal, for example, and the eyeballs that see Singapore as a happening and aspirational place -it is imprinted on this individual's mind -one day I would like to go to Singapore (Wong, 4 February 2004, interview) .\n"," Using hallmark or special events to manage impressions of a destination can further enhance the existing product offering, whether cultural, sporting or business. Returning to the Singapore Grand Prix, the STB believes that its presence in Singapore will create ' positive energy ' , unrivalled ' exposure ' and an opportunity to showcase the city's physical, cultural, sporting, artistic and historical landmarks. Events provide an unparalleled immediacy of message which makes them attractive to place marketers:\n"," Branding brings in immediate returns in terms of media attention, global media attention. So we are very conscious of the branding potential of ourselves as an eventful city. But now we are going to be more strategic and discriminating in picking up the ones (events) that will attract different markets (Khor, 6 February 2004, interview) .\n"," What is apparent in this strategy is that the government agencies are now discriminating between those events which have local value and meaning and those which will bring exposure to new audiences and lucrative broadcasting revenues. At this time, the agencies responsible for economic development are concentrating on exploiting the potential of the latter, sometimes at the expense of events with significant national (and regional) appeal:\n"," You have … events like table tennis and badminton which we are actually quite good at, in Asian culture we are quite good at. We have opportunities to win Gold medals at Olympics or Asian Games, but from the commercial infrastructure perspectives it is limited because the sports are not really sexy -there isn't enough appeal (Khoo, 4 February 2004, interview) .\n"," In this example, decisions over the support for specific sports events are made on the basis of commercial appeal and not national participation targets. This reflects the dominance of neoliberal entrepreneurial strategies and their impact on other public stakeholders within the Singaporean context. The Singapore Sports Council interviewee (Khoo, 4 February, interview) indicated a tension between the needs of the sports development agenda and the economic imperatives underpinning the international events strategy. The logic of capital certainly informs sport and arts policy in Singapore, but with low levels of expressed discontent a feature of Singaporean society, the outcomes of the policy drive are perhaps less noticeable than in other cities (e.g. Toronto).\n"," Another noticeable feature of Singapore's event-led strategy is the way in which the promotion of indigenous cultural events (e.g. Chingay, River Hong Bao Festival and Taipusam Festival) comes together with world-class sporting spectaculars to symbolise the notion of a ' New Asia ' brand, where ' East meets West, Asian heritage blends with modernity and sophistication, and old world charm combined with new world vision ' (MITA, 2002) . Chang and Huang (2005) argue that the creation of the New Asia brand in Singapore is tied up with re-fashioning the built environment (e.g. the river), the staging of events and activities (e.g. the F1 Grand Prix) and the establishment of public art installations. They also see this move as reflecting wider state attempts to create new memories and identities for Singaporememories befitting its aspiration to acquire and sustain global city status through Destination Singapore. Returning to MITA's version of the New Asia Brand, the F1 Grand Prix epitomises the ' West ' , ' modernity ' and the ' new world vision ' . The street circuit is designed specifically to open up key landmarks to media view, animating the city's wider cultural heritage attractions to the watching world. In the Singapore context, like elsewhere, events operate as brand vehicles employed to communicate visual and audio messages via the symbolic realm of inter-urban place marketing competition.\n"," However, despite Singapore's apparent success in attracting the attention of the world's arts and sporting glitterati in the form of the Singapore Arts Festival and the F1 Grand Prix, there are clear dangers associated with a rapid rise to prominence. Given the earlier discussion of the dangers of serial monotony and homogenised uniqueness, it is important to subject Singapore's events-led strategy to further critical scrutiny on the basis of its ongoing sustainability. In interviews with key policy makers, it was apparent that there is some concern associated with a shift away from a mainly local or regional events policy, driven by the demands of national unity towards a more abstract, place branding strategy. Chang and Yeoh (1999) warn of the creation of inauthenticity and the Sports Council representative reinforces this view in the following commentary:\n"," I think the first priority is to understand that events must be local first before you go outside. If you have a 50,000 seater and you can only fill it with 5,000 people even though it has got massive international appeal you are really losing out because international appeal takes time to build. I think for Singapore, six to eight major events probably is just right for us and you can underpin that with a whole group of different events that can bring the vibrancy of a community (Khoo, 4 February 2004, interview).\n"," This response was also repeated in interviews with the cultural agencies and with representatives of the STB. However, whilst the global place wars continue apace, it is unlikely that Singapore's agents of economic development will alter their internationalisation strategies in the face of the inevitable global forces which require cities around the world to engage in interdependent transnational relationships with other aspiring contenders. Singapore is often described as a ' hub ' for a variety of business and travel processes, but it is now striving to exploit its events and entertainment offering to gain recognition as a tourism destination in its own right rather than as a stopover on the journey to Australia.\n"," Since gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, the Singaporean government has undertaken a series of national unity projects designed to secure the active consent of its population around the values of hard work and thrift. However, with its rapid industrial and subsequent postindustrial growth, Singapore has had to embrace the challenge of securing the valuable mobile capital of investors and tourists in the face of increasingly competitive global place wars. Since the turn of the new millennium, Singapore has invested heavily in an events-led strategy designed to secure its position as the Events and Entertainment Capital of Asia. In its use of sporting and cultural events to re-brand itself as a vibrant destination, Singapore has sought to animate its existing attractions and landscapes to communicate positive cosmopolitan credentials to regional and international audiences. As part of this strategy, Singapore has invested significant public funds to support infrastructural developments and bids for internationally recognised sporting events which bring immediate symbolic returns, in terms of the communication of managed images through the global media complex. The forthcoming Singapore F1 Grand Prix is the vehicle on which Singapore hopes to build an international reputation as a leisure and entertainment hub -one worth visiting as a destination in its own right. The brand identity transmitted in the interface between traditional cultural events and manufactured sporting spectacles is inseparable from the notion of Singapore as New Asia -a city in which tradition and modernity sit as one alongside multi-ethnic diversity and globally recognisable products and services. The old and the new, the authentic and the contrived are immutable features of the Singaporean events offering. However, should the balance of power shift too far towards a reliance on disconnected and deterritorialised media events, then Singapore may be relying on an aspirational Event and Entertainment Capital of Asia brand built more on the pursuance of symbolic identity than on material logic.\n","Score: 1.3439363646046425\n","\n","Title: Viral genome-capsid core senses host environments to Short Title: Role of RNA in TCV disassembly\n","Body Text: [4,5] of the virus particle, and largely report on more structured elements of the virus particle and 57 offer only limited insights into the interior of the viral particle. Currently, viral recognition and responses to host environments is poorly understood. Here, we 63 describe the intrinsic dynamics of virus particles and changes in conformation associated with 64 host-specific environments in vitro. 65 We selected Turnip crinkle virus (TCV), a plant RNA icosahedral virus model for mapping previously been solved at low resolution (11 and 18 Å respectively). These structures show a 83 disordered arm in the A and B conformations and more folded structure in the C conformation. 84 The A subunits form the 5-fold axis, while the B and C subunits form the 3-fold (or quasi 6-fold) 85 axis. The arms of the C subunit form a beta annulus structure at the 3-fold axis that has been 86 postulated to be involved in RNA binding [13] . 87 To obtain additional insights into the interior of the virus particle, we have carried out 88 orthogonal cryo-EM, simulation-assisted structure refinement, and amide hydrogen/deuterium 89 exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) analysis of the different states of TCV. HDXMS is a 90 powerful technique that can be used to identify regions involved in conformational changes within 91 a protein, and within protein-protein, protein-lipid, protein-ligand or protein-nucleic acid 92 interfaces by reporting on hydrogen bonding and solvent accessibility [14, 15] . HDXMS also 93 allows detection of multiple conformational populations in solution and has been combined with 94 variable urea denaturation to estimate the relative strengths of the icosahedral viral assembly 95 [16, 17] . 96 We report a high resolution (3.2 Å) map that clearly shows the asymmetry in the interior 97 of the TCV particle and captures TCV in the process of releasing its genomic RNA into the host 98 plant cell. While the icosahedral geometry can be clearly described at this resolution, the specific 99 RNA-R domain binding interactions inside the whole virus particle are still unresolved and reflect 100 a highly dynamic interior, corroborated by HDXMS. Our findings further reveal a highly 101 disordered R-domain that is composed of genomic RNA-tightly bound (~5.7%) capsid protein.\n"," Significantly, a majority of the capsid protein (~94.3%) is only loosely bound to the genomic 103 RNA-capsid core. The basis for the TCV virion assembly lies in a subset of the capsid protein 104 population binding strongly to RNA to generate a ribonucleoprotein core capable of nucleating 105 assembly of many more capsid protein units to generate an icosahedral particle. The intrinsic 106 metastability of native TCV is explained by the interplay between the small subset of strong capsid 107 RNA interactions holding together the RNA-capsid core and weaker capsid interactions 108 maintaining the icosahedral geometry. Far from being a passive entity, the genomic RNA-capsid 109 core complex is the 'controller switch' for virus assembly-disassembly transitions. Table) .\n"," Of the three domains, the R domain showed the greatest magnitude exchange while the S 118 and P domains showed lower relative exchange overall, consistent with the R domain being the 119 least structurally ordered domain (Fig 2A) . Mass spectral envelopes of N-terminal peptides 120 spanning the R domain upon deuterium exchange showed two distinct populations corresponding 121 to a low exchanging (blue) and high exchanging (green) population respectively ( Fig 2B) . These To capture conformational changes associated with particle expansion, we next carried out 136 HDXMS of expanded TCV which was generated by chelation of Ca 2+ with EDTA. Differences in 137 exchange between the expanded and native TCV particles are represented as a deuterium exchange 138 difference plot (Fig 3A) . Increases in exchange were observed predominantly in the S domain.\n"," These regions exhibiting increases in exchange greater than 0.5 D are indicated in red ( Fig 3B) . The RNA-bound fraction showed low deuterium exchange for the R domain peptides while 170 the RNA-free fraction corresponded to the higher exchanging population. Figure 4B in the RNA-capsid core-complex implying that the low exchanging population in the native virus 177 particle represented the proportion of the R domain tightly bound to genomic RNA. Importantly, the higher exchanging population of the native state showed lower deuterium 179 exchange compared to free coat protein from the disassembled virus ( Fig 4B) . This indicated that 180 the higher exchanging population represented the fraction of R domain peripherally bound to the 181 genomic RNA in the native particle, which is disrupted by high salt, leading to disassembly of 182 TCV into the RNA-capsid core-complex and free TCV coat proteins. While mass spectra of all the 183 deuterium exchanged R domain peptides allowed an estimate (~13.6%) of the relative abundance 184 of RNA-bound and free coat protein, the mass spectra of deuterium exchanged peptide 66-89 alone 185 allowed the most accurate quantitation to a baseline resolution estimate of the relative abundance 186 of RNA-bound and RNA-free TCV coat protein (S2 Table) . bound to the RNA-capsid protein core in native TCV (Fig 6) .\n"," These results reveal the critical importance of the genomic RNA capsid protein complex 268 to function as a sensor for the host environment. Increased osmolyte and decreased Ca 2+ in the host environment disrupts weak contacts between the capsid and RNA genome during expansion.\n"," Conformational changes in the genomic RNA-capsid core lead to the detection of a major 271 (~86.4%) unbound population of R domain, and a minor (~15%) strongly bound population of R 272 domain in the expanded particle. This conformational change primes the RNA for future release.\n"," Release can then occur in vitro in the presence of high osmolality (500 mM NaCl) which leads to 274 continued association of the RNA-capsid core. In vivo, the primed RNA genome is extruded from 275 the expanded particle by cellular ribosomes as was shown previously [13].\n"," Our cryo-EM analysis has revealed that the genomic RNA-capsid interactions are not 277 equally distributed throughout the expanded particle. Instead, an asymmetric packaging was 278 observed with a protrusion point a one specific 5-fold axis that also likely represents the covalent 279 p80 dimer. Additionally, increased density from the interior of the particle can be seen near this 280 protrusion point. The covalent dimer is also part of the genome capsid core during assembly, 281 suggesting that the genomic RNA acts as a nucleation point for the RNA capsid core during 282 assembly. This RNA-capsid core is then maintained in the whole viral particle and mediates viral 283 metastability and environmental sensing. During the disassembly process, the RNA directs 284 extrusion toward one specific 5-fold axis.\n"," These results underscore the significance of RNA structure and conformational dynamics 286 of RNA-capsid cores in viral sensing and disassembly. We have tracked dynamics of TCV through 287 the entire particle disassembly process (Fig 6) . During disassembly, the TCV particle goes through . We set a threshold fit value score of 0.9 for the 382 goodness of fit of the experimental mass spectral envelope for deuterium exchanged peptides with the theoretical envelope. If the fit score for a peptide is less than the threshold, the program 384 will fit the spectral envelope to a bimodal distribution. If the score of the bimodal distribution is 385 greater than that of the unimodal distribution, the program assigns a lower exchanging (left 386 population) and a higher exchanging (right population). Results from deconvolution for mass 387 spectra (peptide 66-89) for each of the three states are shown in S. Figure 2 and S.

While awareness regarding compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 1990) appears to be gradually increasing, assumptions and misconceptions regarding the capabilities of nurses and nursing students with disabilities continue. This article summarizes the results from more than a decade of research and suggests implications and practical strategies for greater inclusion of people with disabilities in nursing.\n"," In 2017, approximately 11 percent of non-institutionalized people of all ages living in the United States reported having a disability. Types of disabilities included visual, self-care, hearing, cognitive, disability related to living independently and disabilities ambulating in order from lowest to highest prevalence. In that year, the percentage of people ages 18-64 working full time was approximately 24%. Of those people of working age with a disability, 34% had a high school diploma as their highest level of education, 32% had some college and 15% had a bachelor's degree (Erickson, Lee, & Von Schrader, 2020) . People with hearing disabilities were most likely to have some college compared to people with other types of disabilities. Those with disabilities related to living independently were the least likely to have any college education. An estimated 19% of people who'd graduated from high school or its equivalent reported having a disability (Erickson, Lee, & von Schrader, 2017) . While the number of nurses with disabilities is unknown, 1 in 4 people in the United States has a disability (Centers for Disease Control, 2018).\n"," Nurses are likely to be among them.\n"," The ADA of (1990) recognized that people with disabilities are entitled to the same rights as everyone else. The ADA mandated, through three different statutes, that persons with disabilities be treated equitably in both public and private settings, such as businesses and schools. The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act (ADAAA) of 2008 expanded on the original law. The ADAAA maintains the ADA's definition of the term disability \"as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; a record (or past history) of such an impairment; or being regarded as having a disability.\" However, Congress expanded on the original law by making it clear that courts should interpret the definition of disability more broadly than the United States Supreme Court had instructed under the ADA as originally passed. Thus, for example chronic illness qualifies as a disability, as do temporary alterations in ability or health. In addition, if a nurse does not have a disability but cares for a family member with a disability or chronic illness, the amendment protects the nurse from discrimination should she/he need to miss work to care for the family member. Title I of the ADA addresses employment, in both the private and public sectors; Title II deals with public services; and Title III concerns \"public accommodations,\" which are private businesses open to the public (ADA, 1990).\n"," Nursing programs typically admit students with learning disabilities but are much less likely to admit students with physical disabilities (Betz, Smith & Bui, 2012) . The primary reason for this seems to be concerns about safety, both for the student and the patients they will care for in their clinical placement practica. Despite this widespread belief, there is no evidence to indicate that a student or a nurse with a disability has jeopardized patient safety as a direct result of having a physical disability.\n"," One might conjecture that there should be just as much concern regarding a student or a nurse with a learning disability, especially if they need extra time to learn or complete a task or need an assistive device, as with a student or nurse with a physical disability. Yet, we continue to be fearful about recruiting and admitting students with physical disabilities. Studies have shown that faculty misconceptions regarding what students with disabilities can do safely is the primary barrier to admitting and retaining these students (Carey, 2012; Davidson, et al., 2016; May, 2014; Neal-Boylan & Miller, 2018 , Neal-Boylan & Miller, 2017 . Similarly, the lack of supportive administrators is the primary barrier to the employment of nurses with physical disabilities in clinical settings (Neal-Boylan & Guillett, 2008b; Neal-Boylan, 2014; Neal-Boylan, 2019) .\n"," In 2008, a study was conducted to compare the experiences of nurses with disabilities and nurse recruiters during the hiring process (Neal-Boylan & Guillett, 2008a) . Interestingly, the nurses with physical disabilities revealed that they hide their disability if at all possible, while the nurse recruiters claimed they'd never interviewed a nurse with a disability. The results from the qualitative study were difficult to generalize but it was clear there was a disconnect that begged further exploration. Hiding one's disability whenever possible from employers and colleagues became a recurrent theme in the studies of both nurses and nursing students.\n"," A subsequent study (Neal-Boylan, Fennie, & Baldauf-Wagner, 2011) explored whether the experiences of nurses with sensory disabilities (hearing, seeing or communication) were similar to the experiences of nurses with other physical disabilities. None of the participants had low or no vision, very few had disabilities of communication while most had hearing disabilities or impairments. We postulated that people with vision or communication disabilities were not going into nursing. Most of the nurses with disabilities of hearing, left or contemplated leaving employment in hospital settings despite the minimal accommodations necessary to help them safely perform their jobs. They reported that the accommodations they were supposed to receive were not forthcoming or were ignored. For example, several nurses with hearing impairments asked for meeting minutes to be put in writing. This request was frequently ignored.\n"," A study of nurses and physicians with disabilities (Neal-Boylan, Hopkins, Skeete, et al., 2012) found that their experiences were comparable. Physicians with disabilities also try to hide their disabilities. In both professions, others, even those within their own disciplines, are reluctant to acknowledge that there is more than one way to safely perform a procedure or care for a patient.\n"," Attempts to compensate for the disability, no matter how safe, are rarely supported by colleagues.\n"," While many nurses with disabilities have been leaving the profession, mostly because they are unaware of their rights, whom to contact for help or which settings might be more receptive to their employment, some have found jobs in nursing. However, a study of those nurses (Neal-Boylan, 2014) found that few had been given job descriptions and those that received them revealed that the essential functions of their jobs did not match the job descriptions.\n"," It is an antiquated view of nursing to attribute so much significance to heavy lifting and moving patients. Many nurses need to perform these functions but they don't typically perform them alone and they frequently have the assistance of people and technology. However, these requirements continue to be included as essential job functions to the detriment of nurses with disabilities. In fact, when nurses with disabilities sue their employers for violations of Title I of the ADA, employers often point to the fact that the nurse plaintiff could not meet the \"essential job function\" of lifting as a defense to the law suit. Unfortunately, courts are often willing to take the employer's definition of the nurse employee's essential job functions at face value, holding that the nurse is not otherwise qualified for the position. This high degree of deference to employer-provided job descriptions makes it more difficult for nurses to win cases under the ADA (Neal-Boylan & Miller, 2015) . This is a frustrating reality for nurses with physical disabilities as it is far more relevant and important today to require critical thinking and sound judgment than heavy lifting.\n"," Previous research studies (Aaberg, 2012; Ailey, Brown, Friese, et al., 2016; Kritsotakis, Galanis, Papastefanakis, et al., 2017; Luckowski, 2016; Neal-Boylan & Guillett, 2008a; 2008b; Neal-Boylan, Fennie & Baldauf-Wagner, 2011; Neal-Boylan, 2012; Neal-Boylan, Hopkins, Skeete, et al., 2012) revealed that nurses were unaware of the requirements of the ADA or how they might be violating them by discriminating against nurses with disabilities. The studies that followed (Davidson, Rushton, Dotzenrod, Godack, Baker, Nolan, 2016; Oermann, 2016 League for nursing (2016) have statements that include people with disabilities. However, it is unclear whether nursing programs take initiative or put as much effort into the inclusion of students with disabilities as they do for students of varied ethnic or racial backgrounds.\n"," If faculty confuse the essential functions of nursing work with the academic standards required of nursing students, then students with disabilities are less likely to be welcomed, admitted or accommodated (Levey, 2014; Matt, Maheady, & Fleming, 2015) . Essential functions are the abilities required in a particular nursing setting. However, nurses work in a variety of settings that may include sitting behind a desk or working from home. Technical standards (Marks & Ailey, 2014 ) required by nursing programs should pertain to academic success. If a student can meet the academic standards with sanctioned accommodations, then the student meets the criteria and qualifies to continue as a nursing student.\n"," Technical standards may require the student to be able to communicate, interact with others, meet the intellectual demands of the program and think critically. Technical standards should not mimic essential functions of nursing work, such as lifting, running or hearing. Technical standards, program outcomes and course objectives should specify what must be accomplished, such as auscultating lung sounds, but should not specify how this must be done. A student with a hearing impairment can use a special stethoscope that magnifies the lung sounds and still meet the objective.\n"," Clinical facilities may require students to be able to lift or ambulate independently (without an assistive device); however, they are also held to the requirements of the ADA. The school of nursing should work with the Disability Resource Professionals (DRP) in the college and in the clinical facility to determine if the student with an accommodation can practice safely within the specific clinical setting. A student with a missing arm may need assistance to perform a wound dressing but can still direct the wound care and perform the procedure safely with the assistance of another person or a piece of equipment.\n"," It is important to remember that all nurses don't practice in the hospital. In fact, more nurses practice in the community than in the hospital. There are a variety of settings in which a student can be placed to meet the clinical objectives. This author is currently experiencing alterations in assessing the clinical competence of students during the height of the COVID-19 crisis. All schools of nursing are compelled to use virtual simulations in place of direct care experiences.\n"," These can't replace direct patient care, but they are still valuable to teach clinical decision making and critical thinking. Simulation and virtual technology can also be used by a student with a disability to demonstrate competence with a specific skill.\n"," Programs of nursing are not expected, nor should they lower their academic standards to accommodate a student with a disability. The law requires \"reasonable\" accommodations. In practical terms, \"reasonable\" translates to those accommodations that do not \"fundamentally alter\" program standards and do not cost so much that the program will be placed in financial jeopardy (ADA, 1990) .\n"," In 2018, an integrative review of the literature (Neal-Boylan, Miller, & Bell, 2018) was undertaken to discover whether anything had changed for student nurses with disabilities since the ADAAA of 2008. The study found that a lack of awareness regarding the requirements of the law still pervades nursing programs. Fear that the student will jeopardize safety despite a lack of evidence to support that fear continues to prevent nursing programs from admitting and accommodating these students who may have the potential to make excellent nurses.\n"," The study found that students with disabilities still face barriers, especially faculty and administrator lack of awareness. When faculty confuse the essential functions of a nurses job with the academic standards expected of students, they make assumptions about the setting in which the new nurse graduate will work. However, it is the job of the faculty to educate students as generalists. Nursing students with disabilities must be viewed as individuals. Working with the school's DRP will help faculty understand what will meet the needs of the student without lowering academic standards or expectations.\n"," The 2018 study also revealed that faculty are increasingly aware of the universal design approach to inclusion. Universal design suggests that the environment should be the same for everyone, regardless of whether or not they have a disability. For example, rather than limit the time for an exam to one hour and give the student with an accommodation time and a half, would it be appropriate to give everyone an hour and a half to complete the exam?\n"," Rather than implementing universal design, nursing faculty typically approach students with disabilities using the medical model of disability (Marks & McCullough, 2016 ). The medical model claims that the disability is the result of a medical diagnosis, impacts a person's quality of life and should be managed with medical treatment. The social model of disability is preferred.\n"," It claims that disability is a contextual state of being. In essence, one is disabled if the environment is such that the person cannot function optimally within it. Universal design is a logical implementation the social model.\n"," There is as wide a variety of accommodations that can be provided for a nurse or nursing student with a disability as there are disabilities. Advances in technology have significantly increased the alternatives. Nurses are adaptable; there is typically more than one safe way to perform a procedure or deliver care. Physical, speech and occupational health colleagues can assist the nurse or student with a disability to develop safe compensatory techniques. Occupational health and engineering students might work with nursing students to develop a gadget or appliance that will assist the student with a disability to perform tracheostomy care, for example. Pairing a physical or occupational health student with a nursing student with a disability can provide learning experiences for both types of students. The physical therapy student might consider the nursing student their \"patient\" while also assisting the nursing student to care for the patient to whom they are assigned. These are excellent examples of interprofessional teamwork.\n"," There are electronic note takers that can be used instead of or to supplement a peer note taker.\n"," Virtual reality programs and simulation scenarios are perfect for allowing a student to demonstrate what they know in a safe environment. Adaptive hearing devices can be very helpful to nurses and students. There are specially made stethoscopes for the hearing impaired Nurses or students with low vision can use magnifiers. It is also possible to stock the school skills lab with syringes that have larger numbers. These are only a few examples of the many accommodations that can be provided to nurses and students with disabilities. The college's DRP will know of many more.\n"," Not everyone should be a nurse. However, we may be inadvertently excluding intelligent, compassionate people from nursing because of misconceptions and unfounded fears. Nursing programs considering greater inclusion of students with disabilities should meet with their DRPs and acquire a more comprehensive understanding of the ADA and its requirements. Faculty should revisit their technical standards (Marks & Ailey, 2014; Matt, Maheady, & Fleming, 2015) to determine if they are ADA compliant.\n"," Faculty and administrators cannot make their own accommodations. These must be developed through official channels and in collaboration with the Disability Services Office and the DRP.\n"," While faculty may think they are helping a student by establishing their own accommodations, they may be unintentionally discriminating against students without disabilities. Collaboration with clinical placement sites is very important. Help clinical partners understand that students with accommodations can compensate safely. Use your DRP as an advocate.\n"," It is crucial to meet the needs of the individual student and not assume that one approach works for everyone with a disability, even if the disability is the same or similar to someone else's.\n"," People with disabilities know their bodies and abilities better than anyone else does so let them show you what they can do and how they can do it. Consider refocusing your approach to nurses and students with disabilities using the social model of disability and universal design. Avoid confusing essential functions of the nursing role with academic requirements to succeed in nursing school and practice as a safe novice nurse.\n"," Most importantly, educate yourself and your staff about the law and disability. Renew your education annually or as needed per the recommendation of your DRP. Let's say we are inclusive and mean it.\n","Score: 1.322878786303103\n","\n","Title: Towards the Definition of a Low-Cost Toolbox for Qualitative Inspection of Painted Historical Vaults by Means of Modified DSLR Cameras, Open Source Programs and Signal Processing Techniques\n","Body Text: In this paper, we present a recent multispectral survey carried out within a monumental building in the historical center of Cagliari, Italy: the church of San Giuseppe Calasanzio (Fig. 1a) . Built between XVII and XVIII centuries in a baroque style, like other Italian churches of the Piarists' Order [1] , together with the adjacent college. The church has a barrel-vaulted nave with three chapels intercommunicating on the sides and a deep presbytery, covered with a dome on an octagonal drum from which it is possible to laterally reach the sacristy and the building of the college (Fig. 1b) ; The complex is currently close because of long-lasting and incomplete restoration works with a general state of decay of the inner finishes. At ground level, the vault of the sacristy, indicated with red region in Fig. 1b and geometrically reconstructed in Fig. 2 , has painting finishes with pictures of religious themes on the inner side, with decayed parts (Fig. 3a, b) . First floor level over the sacristy is communicating with the college. Instrumental miniaturization has recently focused the interest of geophysical community to the application of micro-geophysics to also architectural elements [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .\n"," The growing attention of our society to cultural heritage assets made possible an extension of traditional disciplinary limits to new methods and technology which, even with strong contribution from consolidated geophysical techniques, are developing aiming to resolve specific issues linked to the new diagnostic targets [17, 18] .\n"," In this context, an important role is being played by remote sensing techniques. Nowadays, remote sensing methods are an evolving research field taking advantage of the knowledge contamination from many specializations related to surveys and technology [19] .\n"," The most immediate demand for historical architecture documentation is the reconstruction of detailed and reliable 3D models of the monuments or their elements, that can be achieved with geomatic technologies such as photogrammetry through image-based modelling and Terrestrial Laser Scanner [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Structural analysis of cultural heritage assets is also possible by means of motion video magnification [27] or other photogrammetric techniques [28] .\n"," The experimental dynamic behavior of valuable historical slender structures, such as bridges, bell towers or other structures with one dimension prevailing on the others, can be assessed with ground-based remote sensing instruments simultaneously measuring structural vibrations of multiple backscattering points by means of Real Aperture Radar (RAR) interferometry [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .\n"," Based on the radar interferometry, even slow movements of more complex building elements or parts of historical centers and Cultural Heritage sites are monitored using satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar [34] [35] [36] [37] .\n"," Another emerging remote sensing technique in the field of Cultural Heritage inspection is the so called Teraherz (THz) technology, which, based on the recording of electromagnetic (EM) waves of that bands, is used on various kinds of archaeological or historical items allowing, under specific experimental setups, to image studies bodies at various depths [38, 39] .\n"," Thermal infrared acquisitions allow the assessment of various issues linked to monuments studies, like detection of moisture presence, cracks, voids and anomalous elements in historical walls [21, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . The application of infrared thermography to small objects reliably identified hidden defects or invisible restoration works [38, [46] [47] [48] [49] .\n"," Multispectral (MS) remote sensing mostly investigates the surface finishes through their interaction with the radiation from a range of wavelengths, both visible and invisible to the human eye, across the EM spectrum. Acquisition setup include camera, light sources, and filters parameters.\n"," Multispectral images are usually composed by different monochrome images collected by filtering the electromagnetic signals reflected and/or emitted by the objects through narrow spectral bands (Fig. 4) . In most cases, the images are acquired:\n"," • at the spectral interval of the ultraviolet light, at wavelengths lower than 400 nm; • at the visible frequencies, corresponding to the wavelength interval comprised between about 400 nm and 700 nm; • and at several frequency bands of the infrared signals, typically in the spectral bands of -Near Infrared (NIR), between 700 nm and 1100 nm, -Short Wavelength Infrared (SWIR), between 1100 and 3000 nm, -Mid Wavelength Infrared (MWIR), from 3000 nm to 6000 nm, -Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR), from 6000 to 15000 nm, and Far/Extreme Infrared (TIR), from 15000 nm to 1000000 nm.\n"," These EM bands sensing is also known as optical remote sensing and is sensitive to a wide range of applications [19] . We have already mentioned THz and thermographic techniques, which often constitute part of the multispectral protocols extended to all or most parts of the optical remote sensing bands [38, 45, 49] .\n"," Over the time, the multispectral analysis has been improved to study paintings, frescoes and historical documents [52] . Advances in this field of study allow the identification of the kind of material utilized by the artists and the detection of overlays, drawing additions, defects and past pictures not clearly readable by means of the visible light. Depending on the comparison of the energizing and the recorded spectrum, we can distinguish fluorescence or reflectometric surveys.\n"," The most common experimental configurations are based on recording the reflection of a natural or artificial energizing flux, in bands from ultraviolet (UV) to nearinfrared (NIR), (Fig. 5) . Their use allows to study the most superficial layers of paintings and writings [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . As predictable, the penetration depth of the different signals mainly depends on their wavelength. As shown in the scheme of Fig. 5 , the investigation depth increases as the frequency of the electromagnetic wave decreases.\n"," MS surveys are characterized by several parameters that influence the quality and the features of the experimental images. In the scientific literature different resolutions are defined. In particular, the spatial resolution indicates the size of a single pixel of the acquired data. The spectral resolution describes the width of the spectral bands that the sensor is suitable to record. The radiometric resolution defines the ability of the sensor to differentiate among small variations in the sensor incoming EM signal. In addition, the time resolution represents the time interval between two consecutive acquisitions [19] . In November and December 2017, the complex of San Giuseppe Calasanzio was the object of geophysical measurements as a preliminary step to develop a diagnostic protocol for the integrated knowledge of historical architectonic elements [11] .\n"," To test the usefulness of multispectral reflectometric methods for the inspection of precious inaccessible surfaces, this proximal sensing technique was applied to the sacristy painted vault. A set of low-cost hardware constitutes the acquisition instrumental fleet. Some processing steps are developed and proposed that can be easily implemented with open-source tools. Their preliminary application to the multispectral datasets is described to verify potentialities in detail enhancing, joint information retrieving and rough differentiation of apparently very similar pigments.\n"," The multispectral images were collected in raw format using a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera, Nikon D750, modified by removal of the internal bandpass EM original filter. This, permanent, operation allows the camera sensor to receive and record EM energy for a spectrum wider than the only visible band for which it was designed. To perform the multispectral over multiple narrower bands, five external optical filters were mounted, one by one, over the camera lenses (Fig. 6 ):\n"," • an UV bandpass filter, with acquisition in the range 320-390 nm;\n"," • a visible bandpass filter, in the range 390-700 nm;\n"," • an IR high pass filter at 720 nm;\n"," • an IR high pass filter at 850 nm;\n"," • an IR high pass filter at 950 nm.\n"," The camera setup was remotely controlled with a commercial acquisition software package distributed by the same manufacturer, the Nikon Camera Control Pro 2 (Fig. 7a) . Raw images had been acquired at a resolution of 6016 by 4016 pixels, with the following acquisition setup: To make more uniform the target lighting and to guarantee an energization over the camera recording bands, four artificial halogen lights were utilized (960 W, in total), and natural light was reduced as much as possible.\n"," The MS datasets were collected shots through four shots across the painted vault of the sacristy (Fig. 7b) : the camera was positioned approximately at one meter from ground, with direction mostly perpendicular to the vault inspected regions. \n"," Preliminarily to most processing steps, acquires datasets have been pre-processed with a Multi-Image Stacking (MIS) approach [45, [55] [56] [57] . Following this technique, raw MS images are acquired setting multiple camera exposition times for each combination of the other acquisition parameters (shot, optical filters, camera and light setups). Each RGB image, recorder with the given exposure, is then converted to a 16 bit grayscale image and then stacked with others at varying exposition time to produce an image (representative of the full stack images) which maintains a high level of details, optimized over each region of expositions (Fig. 8) . This procedure is repeated for each spectral gathering of acquisitions (each EM passband filter) and for each shot, using free image conversion and common mathematical processing tools.\n"," MS data are essentially images that can be processed as images or matrices with most common software tools for image editing (like GIMP, GNU Image Manipulation Program, or Photoshop by Adobe) and mathematical processing (like GNU Octave or MATLAB, MATrix LABoratory, by MathWorks).\n"," The processing proposed in this study are feasible with both free and proprietary software, even though they are realized through GIMP and MATLAB. \n"," One set of the processing steps implemented to enhance the qualitative interpretation of the MS datasets include most common functions in image editing, such as histogram enhancing, contrast magnification, color tuning, image fusion techniques, and others [58] .\n"," Furthermore, spatial signals in stacked grayscale images are evidenced using the Wavelet Decompose function [56] , which is now included in the standard distribution of GIMP. The workflow for this processing step, illustrated in Fig. 9 , can be summarized in:\n"," • image spatial wavelet decomposition (6 levels), regional field removing (−1 level); • histogram enhancing, contrast and brightness calibration, curve levels adjustments;\n"," • merging of resulting high spatial frequency levels. Finally, spectral dimension of experimental datasets can be explored, inside image editing environment, using popular tools like RGB channel combination or levels merging with the possibility to set up many parameters.\n"," The second set of experimented processing steps was realized inside less user friendly but more powerful and flexible platforms, like the mathematical programming environments which however maintain a certain easy to use with respect to programming languages.\n"," Most of the processing developed inside GIMP can be repeated even inside MATLAB environment, and some were, but with a little bigger difficulty due to the substantial absence of a graphical interface to tune many of the processing parameters. At least for beginners. Nevertheless, mathematical processing platforms flexibly allow to implement most complex processing like Principal Component Analysis, which is quite common in multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing protocols so much that is available in specialized environmental remote sensing software (e.g. the open source SNAP by ESA).\n"," The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear transformation implemented with the purpose to reduce multidimensional data in a few dimensions data set. The principle at the base of this technique considers that in many cases the data show correlations between their different dimensions. Through the PCA, the data are projected in a new set of axes. The new reference system is composed by the fewest possible dimensions. Therefore, this procedure consists of a coordinate transformation that allows to plot the original data in a new reference system of orthogonal axes with a minimum correlation between the variables. The first axis, derived from the PCA process, is oriented in the direction of the most variation, the second, in the direction of the new-most variation, etc. In order to calculate the new set of axes, the eigenvalueseigenvectors decomposition is utilized. The eigenvectors are unit vectors pointing in the direction of the new axes of the reference system. The axis with the highest eigenvalue corresponds to the axis explaining the most variation of data set [59] .\n"," Various sets of digital image processing were applied to the sample datasets, revealing great potentialities on their use to have a quick access to interpretable data through free software of generalist use. Images in Fig. 10 and their magnification in Fig. 11 show how is possible to quite simply obtain enhanced images where many details previously unrecognizable are revealed and interpretation of the inspected surfaces is aided. Global view of Fig. 10 allows to evaluate the great quantity of informative data that appear to the watcher in terms of color lost drawings, minor cracks, surface roughness, to name some. Looking at a sample magnification, in Fig. 11 , it is possible to notice a lot of the features of the original paints, revealing many details of leaves and decorations or evidencing an element previously imperceptible like the tape indicated by the white arrow.\n"," Principal Component Analyses were applied to the four shots MS data, both raw, stacked and their combination. Here are presented some results from the processing of mixed datasets, with raw RGB visible images converted to bit depth homogeneous to grayscale UV and NIR data. In these conditions, we have input multidimensional matrices consisting in three layers for each acquisition at visible band for varying exposure times, plus one stacked UV layer and three stacked NIR layers (720, 850 and 950 nm filters). The layers identities are the vector base to which the eigenvectors proposed by the PCA are projected in the coordinates contained in the coefficient vectors matrix. For each eigenvector or Principal Component (PC), the dataset has a new coordinate per pixel, the eigenvalue or score matrix, consisting in the eigenvalues of the PCA transformation. Figure 12 shows an RGB visible image acquired for shot 4. Figure 13 reports some results for the MS mixed dataset of the same shot. Figure 13a is the map of the 6-th PC score matrix, to which a threshold definition is applied to enhance the image contrast: many high frequency spatial features are evidenced, with respect to the RGB visible image, that can be reconducted to a subsurface roughness potentially related even to preparatory works. Figure 13b is an RGB false color combination of three principal components scores (R: PC #4; G: PC #5; B: PC #6) used here to differentiate two pigments with almost the same color, indicated by the white arrows. In the same figure, the coefficients of the three used PCs are plotted over part of the RGB false color image: the plot evidence that PC5 and PC6 have almost the same behavior over the original RBG axes constituted by two RGB acquisitions at visible band, but differ each other a lot for original coordinates corresponding to UV, NIR1 (720 nm) and NIR3 (950 nm) acquisitions. As a graphical validation we can see, in the map on the same figure, that the two angels' vests on the left of the image are represented with different behavior, being PC5 (green) prevalent for one and PC6 (blue) for the other. Despite of this, they are very similar in the visible band image (reported also inside Fig. 13b in the white bordered square on the top-right).\n"," The paper presents a first approach towards the definition of a low-cost toolbox for qualitative inspection of valued painted surfaces. Most of the elements (low-cost modified DLSR cameras, pre-processing algorithms, digital image elaboration commands, signal processing techniques) were already existing before this application and are proposed here with the aim of a possible flexible integration in the context of the (qualitative) analysis of valued historical surfaced. The low-cost approach is essential to give a useful set of hardware and software tools which could be applied even to case studies of historical importance but with minor budget availability.\n"," Processed images were able to highlight features on the vault paintings revealing details of the surface or its very shallow layers which were impossible or very difficult to distinguish in raw data.

decontamination by connecting a ventilator exhaust port with an underwater seal system to prevent COVID-19 spread Title\n","Body Text: Airborne infection isolation rooms with negative pressure are not universally available, especially in resource-limited settings like outbreak of corona virus infectious disease-19 .Intensive care unit preparedness in the setting of COVID-19 pandemics have been focused on broad concepts of infection control, increasing staffing capacity, and community engagement. [1] Aerosol-generating procedures should be performed on ICU patients with COVID-19 in a negative pressure room to avoid cross-contamination during the SARS epidemic. [2] Other infection precautions for mechanically ventilated patient include the use of closed systems and dual limb circuitry with a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter attached to the exhalation limb to minimize environmental contamination and to minimize the risk of malfunction of expiratory flow sensors due to contamination with aerosol. [3] It is important that expiratory filters are changed after each nebulizer treatment, or every two to four hours when continuous aerosols are administered. The coronavirus species, ranges in size from 0.06 to 0.2 μm. It is widely believed that HEPA filters are only capable of capturing particles sized 0.3 μm or larger. HEPA filters have been demonstrated to reduce virus transmission in simulated settings. [3] However the tiny mass of particles less than 0.3 μm not able to fly straight stuck into the HEPA filter due to Brownian movement. US government standards require a filter to remove 99.97% of particles sized 0.3 μm in order to qualify as HEPA. [4] In order to provide complete filtration and decontamination of exhaled air, we made an assembly by connecting a ventilator exhalation port (Hamilton C3, SN 2138, Switzerland) with an underwater seal system containing 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, Figure 1 . This assembly allows the passage of exhaled air through 1% sodium hypochlorite solution to make them decontaminated. An earlier study by Kampf G et al [5] concluded that COVID-19, including SARS coronavirus, Middle East J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV), can persist on inanimate surfaces, such as metal, glass, or plastic, for up to 9 days, but are efficiently inactivated by 62% to 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. This assembly may provide an extra protection from COVID-19 cross infection, especially when negative pressure space is not available. In our ICU setup we didn't measure the environmental Covid 19 virus particles level before and after the use of sodium hypochlorite underwater seal system, and thus further research and testing are necessary to validate this hypothesis.\n","Score: 12.884370213593753\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof Time course and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resurgence due to cold-chain food or packaging contamination Time course and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resurgence due to cold-chain food or packaging contamination\n","Body Text: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a global pandemic since early 2020 [1] . With strict nonpharmaceutical public health interventions, the local transmission of COVID-19 was contained in China; however, there have been small-scale outbreaks, especially in port cities, which was believed to be related to contaminated cold-chain food or materials, causing great concern in global. The report from WHO also mentioned the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through frozen products [2] . The persistence, stability and infectivity of contaminated inanimate surfaces argued [3] , to explore the indirect transmission routes of infection by fomite which was ignored.\n"," COVID-19, is a respiratory infection, and the accepted route of transmission is respiratory droplets dispersed by coughing, sneezing, talking and singing or by the spread of aerosols. There is no evidence supporting that SARS-CoV-2 can follow the fecal-oral route, and the chance of foodborne transmission is extremely low [4] . However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 particles from infected personnel to food packaging or to food surfaces is possible. While viruses are not able to propagate on the materials, these materials may work as a potential carrier for their spread. Transmission may occur indirectly through touching contaminated surfaces, followed by touching the mucosal membranes of mouth, nose, or eyes, and fomite transmission is possible [5] . We review the serial events in China after the main outbreak in Wuhan that related to contaminated frozen products and analyze relevant laboratory evidence support this hypothesis, hope to provide a few tips to strengthen the weak links of epidemic prevention and control.\n"," To clarify the possibility of cold-chain food or packaging contamination as a route of COVID-19 transmission, we performed a search on the official website of the Centers for Disease Control of China and local authorities (http://www.chinacdc.cn/en/) for resurgence events that related to cold-chain food or packaging contamination, and official reports or literature about traceability investigation.\n"," We also conducted a literature and report search to assess the relevant epidemiological events and laboratory basis of this transmission route, to support the existence of such mode of transmission.\n"," Since July 2020, a series of incidents of imported frozen food as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in China, and most of the incidents were traced to frozen shrimp imported from Ecuador, where novel coronavirus was found not only on the outer packaging [6] , but also on the inner packaging of frozen Pomfret from Ecuador [7].\n"," On August 12, 2020, authorities in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province found SARS-CoV-without any contact history; later in the outbreak investigation, live virus was isolated from the outer packaging of imported frozen cold cod that was carried by the two stevedores [9]. This event became the first known case where the live SARS-CoV-2 was detected on coldchain food in the world, confirming that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on the outer packaging for a long time under the condition of cold-chain transportation. This finding strongly supports the possibility of cold-chain foods as a vehicle of SARS-CoV-2 spread through cross-border transportation [10].\n"," In fact, as early as 1975, researchers have already found that viruses can survive long-term on common surfaces found in environments, and may play a role in virus transmission [11] .\n"," The recent studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 was detected from inanimate surface in the patient surroundings [12], another study shows unabsorbent materials like plastic are more dangerous than absorbent materials like cotton, because contaminated droplets are difficult to absorb [13] . Besides the effect of different types of materials, humidity and low temperature are more conducive to the survival of virus. SARS-CoV-2 was reported as being viable in aerosols for up to 3 hours and on the surface of stainless steel and plastic for up to 2 and 3 days, respectively, at 21-23℃ and a relative humidity of 40% [14] .\n"," Another study showed that SARS-CoV-2 was stable on swine skin for at least 14 days at 4℃ [15] . Whether at 4℃ or -30℃, refrigerated human milk did not significantly affect the SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral load over 48h period [16] . The lifespan of SARS-CoV-2 at 50% humidity was longer than at 30% humidity [17] . To ensure the quality of cold-chain food, when stored, transported, or sold, low temperature must be maintained all the time, usually at or below -18℃. Plastic is the most common material for outer packaging. The The cold-chain food and their packing could be contaminated at any step of production and transportation, through droplets expelled from infected workers who do not have appropriate personal protection equipment, by coughing, sneezing, talking or even breathing.\n"," On June 11, 2020, after 56 consecutive days of no local transmission events in Beijing, a 52-year-old man was diagnosed with COVID-19, without any contact or travel history. Majority of the outbreaks in China could always be traced to the transmission chain originating from imported food products or mails to workers at market sites, seafood processing facilities, port cold storage, and postal mailing service [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Source of these infections was believed to be contaminated cold-chain food or materials, and it seems more dangerous because infectious SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to survive on the surface of cold-chain food packages for at least 60 days [28] , and even longer at colder temperature and on extreme relative humidity (U-shaped dependence) [29] . With the occurrence of these outbreaks, we realized the existence of such a potential transmission route, and the corresponding prevention and control measures were come up with, and the scale of dissemination was gradually reduced.\n"," On August 11, 2020, New Zealand announced four confirmed cases in one Auckland household after 102 consecutive days of no local transmission events. These cases had no overseas travel history, but one of them was the employee of a cold-chain company [30] .\n"," On August 13, another 13 newly confirmed cases were reported; 3 were employees at the same cold-chain company, and another 7 were family members of these employees. As of October 20, 2020, a total of 179 origin-unknown cases with a C.12 lineage of virus sequence have been reported, and designated as the outbreak of Auckland August Cluster [31] .\n"," Similar outbreaks occurred among workers at processing facilities for meat, poultry, seafood, fruit and vegetable were also observed in other countries, including Japan, Australia, Germany, England and Wales, and the United States [32] .\n"," In addition to SARS-COV-2, norovirus have similar transmission. From July to October, 2019, there have been multiple cruise ship outbreaks of norovirus in the United States, after the review of food provisioning implicated the raspberries as the infection cause. Subsequently, frozen raspberries that can be traced back to China was recalled [33].\n"," We have also noticed that food production workers might be at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection because of their work [34] . Distinctive factors contributed to workplace transmission, including prolonged close contact with coworkers, shared work space, shared transportation and congregate housing [35] . The high-risk workplaces were meat and poultry processing facilities, which had the closest connection with cold-chain food [35, 36] . According to the data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, during March 1 -May 31, 2020, there were 28,364 reported cases and 132 (0.5%) deaths among workers in 382 meat and poultry processing facilities in 31 states\n"," [37]. These workplaces were often crowded, and always with high humidity, which is an ideal environment for SARS-CoV-2 to linger and spread. In the process of production and packaging, the virus might attach to the inner and outer packaging, even to food, and persist for a long time under the conditions of cold chain transportation. Under such circumstances, human-to-human, human-to-material, and material-to-human transmissions were all possible.\n"," J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19 is a respiratory infection, virus could replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and shed high RNA copies to environment, especially in the first week of symptom onset [38, 39] . SARS-CoV-2 is also considered to be more stable and persistent than other human coronaviruses in the environment [40] . The following conditions are required for contaminated cold-chain food or packaging to cause human infection. First, COVID-19 carrier could shed virus to surface; second, the virus is still alive after long distances transported, and can remain highly stable on material surfaces, such as card board and plastic, for days, particularly under refrigerated (4℃) and frozen (-10 to -80℃) conditions [41] [42] [43] ; last, workers in wharf are infected through direct contact, and the virus once reach the human body, they can disseminate rapidly through human-to-human transmission [32] .\n"," In this review of the relevant outbreaks, patient zero was always the stevedore and usually asymptomatic. It is likely that the virus titer on the materials will gradually decline over time [29, 43] . Infection due to direct contact with the contaminated material is often mild or asymptomatic, and therefore the patients may not be motivated to seek medical treatment in the beginning; however, they can become the source of infection, through human-to-human transmission, to other vulnerable individuals. Patient zero is often hidden and difficult to detect, and the outbreak can only be perceived after a period of a secret epidemic.\n"," We realized that a positive nucleic acid testing does not necessarily mean the existence of an active transmission. On August 6, 2020, in Yingkou, Liaoning Province, three samples were found to be positive in the testing of outer packaging of the food products, but the nucleic acid as well as antibody testing on 43 employees and 306 related personnel J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of the enterprise were all negative [44] . To date, there have been no case reports of infection caused by eating or purchasing cold-chain products. According to the investigations of the outbreaks, the high-risk group is port staff, especially the stevedores, who may have direct contact with contaminated materials. Protecting workers from becoming infected with COVID-19 presents substantial challenges. These people should be placed on the top priority for immunization.\n"," In response to changes in the transmission routes, the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China promulgated a series of technical guidance at the national level for the prevention and control of COVID-19 transmission related to cold-chain food production in 2021 [45] . Benefitting from these policies, several outbreaks were detected before the occurrence of an epidemic.\n"," The focus of prevention and control therefore should not only focus on imported products but on the entire territory, not only on humans but also on materials. Our observations suggest that regular sampling and testing of high-risk groups and imported products and proper disinfection of imported products should be an effective way to detect and prevent the spread of the virus via such mode of transmission.\n"," The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

Keeping the civilization running requires continuous work on its maintenance. With the increasing reliance of the civilization on the information processing and computer power, the phenomenon of life began to be studied from the viewpoint of its information content [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Gorshkov [7] estimated the information processing capacity of the global biota from the rate of photosynthesis at 10 35 bit s −1 assuming that the biota computes at maximum possible efficiency of the order of kT ≈ 10 −21 Joules per bit [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . This exceeds the global computing capacity of the modern civilization by about fifteen orders of magntude. Recent estimates of computing efficiency in protein synthesis supported the proposition that living systems are fairly close to the Landauer limit and many orders of magnitude more efficient than modern computers [13] . Per unit surface area, the biota consumes two orders of magnitude less power but performs ten millions more operations per second than modern supercomputers demonstrating a billion times greater computing efficiency [14] .\n"," In Section 5, we discuss how the high energy consumption by modern civilization is unlikely a sign of high orderliness but a sign of unsteadiness warning of a potential collapse. In the final Section 7, we discuss how life's major organizing principle, persistence via ensuring genetic and environmental stability, gives the meaning to biological information. We discuss how big disruptive animals, humans, could nevertheless culturally evolve into the guardians of the biosphere and prolong its existence using the scientific analysis of the laws of life functioning and adopting behaviors respecting those fundamental laws.\n"," A more complete description of the biotic regulation concept can be found in Gorshkov [23] and Gorshkov et al. [25] , see also Gorshkov and Makarieva [26, 27, 28] . Here, we introduce its main propositions at the simplified background of the more conventional ideas about life, evolution, and environment (Figure 1a ). The key genetic information of life is assumed to be that about reproduction. Copying of genetic information occurs with errors (mutations), which ensure that all organisms in a population differ (genetic diversity). In any given environment, some organisms reproduce better than others, their genetic information predominantly propagates. The environment may experience random changes, and the criteria of selection it imposes on the organisms, change as well. This causes the genetic information of a species change with time, which on a larger scale constitutes biological evolution. (a) Main genetic information is about how to reproduce. Mutations that accumulate during reproduction (copying of genetic information) serve as an ultimate source for adaptive genetic diversity. The environment undergoes random changes. In a given environment, some individuals survive better than others; this represents natural selection. (b) Main genetic information is about how to stabilize the environment in an optimal state. The genetic information written in quantum molecular memory cells can be copied without errors (ageing). Classical objects (organisms) encoded by this information stabilize the environment compensating for external and internal perturbations. The optimal environment is the one where the genetic information that encodes this environment features maximum competitiveness. In other words, life encodes and maintains an environment where the algorithm that does so possesses maximum fitness. This qualitative picture does not explain the long-term persistence of life and leaves plenty of room for alternative visions. Indeed, as mutations accumulate in the course of copying of genetic information, some individuals with erroneous copies will, in a given environment, reproduce better than others, so there will always be a natural selection of some sorts. However, selection based on relative fitness will not guarantee that the absolute fitness, i.e., the ability of organisms to produce a sufficient amount of healthy progeny, will not decline with time. Indeed, while it has become clear that, in the human population, natural selection is too weak to prevent accumulation of mutational load [29] , it is not clear what general principles would guarantee the necessary efficiency of selection for other species of the biosphere. Besides genetic degradation, another opportunity for life to go extinct comes from the unpredictable, uncontrollable, and unfavorable environmental changes.\n"," A logical way to account for life's persistence without appealing to a lucky chance is to assume that life's basic information kit includes, as its key component, the information about how to regulate the external environment ( Figure 1b) . Governed by this program, living organisms impose a stabilizing impact on the environment keeping it in a state optimal for life's functioning. The notion of optimality presumes that, in this environment, those individuals that perform environmental regulation must be \"the fittest\". This condition of a simultaneous genetic and environmental homeostasis imposes strict constraints on the properties of the optimal environment.\n"," A comprehensive quantitative analysis of these constraints represents a distinct feature of the biotic regulation concept in comparison to other propositions of life's stabilizing environmental impacts, including the Gaia hypothesis [30] . Essentially, the optimal environment must be strongly non-equilibrium, such that, if left without biotic control, it would rapidly degrade to a state decreasing fitness of all organisms. This condition ensures that a mutant with eroded program of environmental regulation, even if initially competitive in the optimal environment, will be unable to spread globally as it will have rapidly destroyed its life-important resources.\n"," Evolution and environmental change are considered as first-order corrections to the main picture of life's homeostasis (Figure 1b) , see also Haldane [31] . Evolution occurs in the direction of a more efficient program of environmental regulation. Paraphrasing a well-known saying about evolution, one can say that nothing in life sciences makes sense except in the light of life's persistence.\n"," How can living organisms ensure persistence of non-equilibrium environmental conditions? The information about characteristics of the optimal environmental state has to be stored and copied. Since the environment of life is macroscopic, it represents a classical object that ages-changes irreversibly with time. Copying of classical objects is not possible without information loss; they undergo decay and are different at any point of time. Thus, the information about environmental conditions, as well as all other life's information, must be written using quantum carriers-objects that do not age and possess the property of identity.\n"," In most biological species, the information about life's complexity is written in the polymer molecules of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Total information written in these molecules constitutes a species' genome. Once this information is lost in extinct species, it cannot be recovered. From paleodata, we know about the dinosaurs, mammoths, and other extinct species. We also know about species driven to extinction by humans-Steller's cow, the dodo bird, the passenger pigeon, the elephant birds, and others. Their genomes are irreversibly lost and irrecoverable. No extinct species ever came into existence again. The paleodata also indicate that the majority of extant species did not change morphologically for millions of years [32] . It logically follows that their genetic program remained invariant as well [33] . Furthermore, all extant life shares a common ancestor, i.e., during the four billion years of life existence there was only one origin of persistent life.\n"," The genetic information can only be copied, not created anew. Copying requires energy expenditures that come from the external environment. Information of the polymer DNA molecules is written with use of four molecular letters-nucleotides. These four letters can bind into complementary pairs to form the double-stranded four-letter DNA molecule. As this molecule is to be copied, the double DNA strand unravels, and, on each of the two strands, the complementary part is synthesized. In the result, two identical DNA molecules are formed of two different cells belonging to one and the same or different individuals of the same species.\n"," During the copying process, errors may occur partially erasing the information DNA carries. These copying errors obey the well-known pattern of radioactive decay. In a characteristic time period (the half-life time), one half of the initial number of the copied molecular objects acquire some errors. The other half remains error-free and identical to the previous generation. This identity is what constitutes the quantum nature of life. If life did not possess this property, i.e., there were no identical copies produced during copying, it would have been impossible to sustain the orderliness of life.\n"," With the probability of point mutation affecting a given nucleotide pair of about ν = 10 −10 per cell division [34] and division frequency of the order of τ −1 = q/K, where q = 1 W kg −1 is the universal mass-specific metabolic rate and K = 4 × 10 6 J kg −1 is the energy content of living matter [28] , the genetic information of life would have melted completely in about τ/ν ≈ one billion years. The observed level of tolerated genetic polymorphism in biological species, about one mutation per 10 3 nucleotides, indicates that a loss of function occurs when about one thousandth of the total amount of information has been lost. This gives a time scale of genetic decay of about one million years. Incidentally, this is close to the mean time of species' existence [35, 36] . If the program of life contains information about how to recognize and delete the erroneous copies from the population, then it could be possible to maintain life's orderliness for an unlimited period of time-or at least to prolong its existence far beyond the half-life time of genetic information. The necessary condition is that erroneous copies should be deleted faster than they reproduce themselves. Again, this condition constrains the properties of the optimal environment where life could persist.\n"," Recognizing and deleting the erroneous copies cannot be realized on the quantum level of DNA molecules. Classical macroscopic organisms are required that are able to consume energy and matter from the environment and function on the basis of the genetic DNA program. Namely, in a population of such macroscopic classical individuals that all age, the program of recognizing and deleting the erroneous information copies can be realized. It is the most complex part of the genetic program itself. This statement is key to the biotic regulation concept. Competitive interaction and natural selection are not merely imposed on the population by an external environment being passive outcomes of the organism-environment interaction (cf. Figure 1a) . Instead, competitive interaction and natural selection represent the key part of the genetic program itself.\n"," This property is not captured in the studies of complexity maintenance by cellular automata e.g., [2, 3, 17] -there the program of selection is external and unrelated to the properties of the algorithm it selects. For example, in the well-known experiment of Mitchell et al. [17] , selection was set to favor the algorithms that correctly performed a certain calculation. This selection strategy got no feedback from the selected algorithms. More generally, among the many aspects studied by information theory in biological systems [37] , the crucial aspect of how life interacts with its environment is practically missing.\n"," Macroscopic physical processes in the Earth's environment do not copy each other but arise anew triggered by external energy flows, of which on Earth the most important one is the solar radiation. All life and civilization are maintained by the ordered solar radiation which is close to the blackbody radiation with temperature T S = 6000 K. The Earth receives solar energy in the form of massless photons. After these photons have perturbed the ground states of molecules on Earth, and the excited states relaxed back to the ground state, the solar photons turn to thermal photons with mean temperature T E = 300 K. The power of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth's surface undergoes decay to thermal radiation via a multitude of diverse channels provided by the living systems, civilization, and the inanimate nature of winds, oceanic currents, storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes.\n"," As the black body radiation consists of photons with mean energy kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant, each solar photon with mean energy kT S decays into approximately T S /T E = 20 thermal photons of the Earth with mean energy kT E . This decay of solar photons into thermal photons shape all events and determine the time of all processes on the Earth's surface. In most fields of theoretical physics, it is assumed that time is isotropic, which presumes that its direction can be reversed. The equations of motion in theoretical physics do not contain information about the decay of excited states of matter. These equations describe transitions of kinetic to potential energy and back for the two known long-range interactions, electromagnetic and gravitational. In the gravitational interaction, time defines the periods of potential-to-kinetic energy transitions, as in ideal pendulum, or rotation of interacting masses over elliptic orbits that characterize the energy of their interaction. In neither of these cases does anything change in the considered processes except the number of oscillations or rotations grows counted from an arbitrary initial state. This number is referred to as time. Thus, defined time does not have a direction and it can be reversed, i.e., it conforms to the condition of isotropy. The considered processes change if only one takes into account dissipation and decay of excited states.\n"," A major achievement of quantum physics consists in the discovery of the identity of the ground and excited states of atoms, molecules, and atomic nuclei. Two quantum objects being in the same states cannot be distinguished from one another. All excited states conform to the law of half-life time decay: starting from a certain initial number of identical excited states, since the so-called half-life time counted using the number of non-dissipating oscillations or rotations, the number of the excited states diminishes by half. The remaining excited states are identical to the initial excited states. The second half undergoes spontaneous or induced decay. Induced decay diminishes the half-life time, but does not change the pattern: there always remain states that have not undergone decay and are identical to the initial states. Those states that have not undergone decay do not change (\"wear\") or age. Only those states that have undergone decay age and wear. The half-life time is a fundamental constant equal for all specific states irrespective of their \"age\". Life is capable of selecting quantum programs with the smallest or optimal half-life time in the environment.\n"," Let us define time as the number of arbitrarily chosen non-dissipating oscillations or rotations that have occurred from the moment when a certain initial amount of ordered states capable of undergoing decay has been prepared, to the moment when they have all undergone decay. If a new excited state has not been prepared by then, the time disappears. The direction of time is uniquely related to the diminishing number of the excited states, and thus automatically relates the cause and consequence. The decay of an excited state is accompanied by release of energy that can be routed along the additional decay channels. The power of a process is equal to the energy of the half of the initial states that have undergone decay divided by the half-life time. An event is the process of decay of an ordered state capable of undergoing decay. If there is no decay, there is no time and no events. If the Sun had been sending the same radiation power but in the thermal part of the spectrum corresponding to T S = T E = 300 K, the Earth would have remained as warm as it is now, but the decay of solar radiation would have been impossible. No processes related to this decay, including the process of life, would be possible. Time would have stopped.\n"," The ordered states that can undergo decay are slowly prepared at the expense of the energy of solar radiation. In the absence of a program governing how they will decay, their decay occurs explosively and the diversity of the possible channels for energy transformation is limited. Rare classical macroscopic physical processes, like wind, rain, storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes, \"die\" and arise anew. They consume the available energy in an explosion-like manner and discontinue until new stores of energy arise in the environment. Molecular quantum copying sometimes spontaneously appears in the inanimate nature at the expense of previously accumulated energy which is likewise spent in an explosive manner (for example, in chemical reactions with catalysts or nuclear chain reactions). Such reactions do not lead to the formation of classical objects that recognize and delete erroneous copies. The explosion-like ordered processes in the inanimate nature discontinue as soon as the energy stores have been depleted, after which all objects that are being copied disappear.\n"," The combination of classical and quantum processes to ensure persistence uniquely differentiates life from the inanimate world. To account for the apparent absence of life elsewhere in the Universe, Chopra and Lineweaver [38] proposed that life may originate relatively often but evolves too slowly to gain control over the planetary environmental conditions. The life-compatible conditions are otherwise unstable and quickly deteriorate driving the \"non-regulating life\" to extinction. In comparison, from the biotic regulation viewpoint, a \"life\" that is not capable of controlling conditions perpetuating its persistence, is not a life. As we discussed, self-copying (reproduction) and metabolism (energy consumption) are common to many processes in the inanimate world.\n"," Life's persistence corresponds to a genetic program that suppresses the explosive energy consumption. A good example is provided by how the biota handles the phase transitions of water on Earth. Water vapor evaporation under the influence of solar radiation is a slow distributed process. Condensation of water vapor, in contrast, is governed by the vertical velocity of the ascending air (the faster it ascends, the faster it cools and moisture condenses), so it may occur at an arbitrarily high rate that exceeds by orders of magnitude the rate of evaporation. Such explosive-like release of energy takes the form of hurricanes and tornadoes that quickly deplete all water vapor previously accumulated in the atmosphere [39] , Table 1 . Over natural undisturbed forests on land, where the hydrological cycle is under biotic control, the spatial and temporal fluctuations of precipitation and wind are strongly suppressed [40] [41] [42] . The biota of the forest plants, fungi, and bacteria on land is able to slow down the rate of water vapor condensation sucking the ocean-evaporated moisture to land. The rates of evaporation and condensation become more equal, and there appears an opportunity of an uninterrupted time that follows the decay channels generated by life.\n"," Civilization slowed down the decay of uranium in nuclear fission reactions and uses them for energy production (Table 1) . Accidental loss of control over the slow-down leads to explosions at the nuclear power plants (Chernobyl, Fukushima). Civilization did not succeed in slowing down the decay of the prepared initial state in the thermonuclear fusion reaction. Consumption of fossil fuels by civilization has been exponentially increasing demonstrating explosion-like dynamics [43] . Destruction of the forest cover by civilization likewise proceeds in an explosion-like manner, with losses of the order of 100% over one tree life span [44] .\n"," The biomass of the immobile life persists due to the equality between the rates of synthesis and decomposition of organic matter by plants, bacteria, and fungi on land and in the ocean. Large animals including humans are able to destroy the biomass of plants at high rates that significantly exceed the slow rate of photosynthesis. The uninterruptedness of the time of life has been maintained because the share of biomass consumption by big animals remained small. If all synthesized biomass is consumed, in an explosion-like manner, by large animals and man, the uninterruptedness of time can be broken and the stability of life on Earth destroyed. Therefore, the uninterrupted time on Earth is determined by life in the decay channels that life itself regulates, i.e., it is a consequence of the existence of life. (Only within the volume of the Sun the thermonuclear reaction is slowed down at the expense of radiation emission that prevents the star from the gravitational collapse. It is the only slow-down of energy flow that is independent of life on Earth.) In what is to follow, we consider these statements in greater detail. Table 1 . \"Explosion\" and \"slow-down\" energy consumption patterns in the biota and civilization. [45] . Note that the total power of thermonuclear explosion of the Tsar Bomba is just about 20 times lower than the power output from the Sun's surface. The only known way to slowdown the thermonuclear reaction is to arrange the thermonuclear fuel within the Sun's volume. 3 The data are taken from [45] . 4 Average energy store per kilogram is twice as much as that in conventional fuel (1 kg of TNT∼4.2 × 10 6 J). The strategic stockpile of explosives in various forms is assumed to correspond to three months of use for explosions. The global average (and local) power of explosions is determined by using the time of explosion and average mass (∼1 kt) of the TNT exploded. The global power of TNT explosions is 10 13 J/[10 −6 s] = 10 19 W. 5 Energy store per kilogram of organic substance has the same order of magnitude as that in the fourth column. The global supply of fossil fuels is determined by the power consumption under the assumption that the strategic reserves of fossil fuels are equal to the 3-month consumption by civilization. Local and average power per unit of Earth's surface area is assumed to be equal to the power of cars; energy consumption of heating and industrial production are characterized by the same order of magnitude. The global power consumption of fossil fuels is known to be equal to 1.7 × 10 13 W. 6 In columns 6 and 7, energy consumption of plant biomass is considered with energy content K = 4 × 10 6 J kg −1 and global store of the order of 10 15 kg [46] assuming most land ecosystems are disturbed; fires consume 2 GtC yr −1 [47] , which constitutes 4% of primary productivity on land 56 GtC yr −1 [48] (7 × 10 13 W), which amounts to 3 × 10 12 W globally or 0.02 W m −2 for land on average. Wood consumption due to logging consumes globally about 0.3 GtC yr −1 [49] ; however, in many regions of the world, logging facilitates forest fires [47, [50] [51] [52] . Instantaneous power for forest fire is estimated as the power of blackbody radiation at 800 K as 10 4 W m −2 . Decay time for fires, 10 5 s = 1 day, is estimated as local biomass store in forests (∼200 kg m −2 ) multiplied by K = 4 × 10 6 J kg −1 and divided by instantaneous local fire power; instantaneous local power of energy consumption by big herbivores, 10 2 -10 3 W m −2 , is taken from Figure 4a ; their total energy consumption in unstable ecosystems may reach 100% primary productivity with a global average of 10% [28] . 7 In intact forests, fires are suppressed by vegetation cover controlling the water regime and occur less frequently than once in a thousand years compared to disturbed ecosystems when burning may occur every 10 years. This is reflected in the mean value of burnt areas, which for non-anthropogenic fires is two orders of magnitude smaller than for anthropogenic fires [50, 51] . Big herbivores in intact forests are allocated less than 1% of primary productivity (Figure 4b ). Global estimates are made assuming 10% of primary production on land from intact ecosystems. 8 Gravitational long-range interactions (via buoyancy and condensation-induced atmospheric dynamics [53] ) determine atmospheric dynamics. Explosion-like energy release in storms (hurricanes and tornadoes) is not controlled by the biota. The energy storage per unit mass is estimated from volume-specific energy storage ρ a V 2 = 10 4 J m −3 , where V∼10 2 m s −1 is wind velocity in the eyewall of the storm and ρ a = 1 kg m −3 is density of atmospheric air. Instantaneous power per unit surface area for storms is estimated as ρ a V 3 = 10 6 W m −2 . Energy storage in floods is gh = 50 J kg −1 , where h∼5 m is height of the surge, g = 9.8 m s −2 is the gravitational acceleration. Assuming that during the flood the water rises by h∼5 m in t = 5 days, the local flood power is ρgh(h/t) = 0.6 W m −2 , where ρ = 10 3 kg m −3 is density of liquid water. Mean global power for floods is estimated assuming that every flood lasts about 2t = 10 days and in one year the total globally affected area is about S f l = 10 6 km 2 [54] , ρgh(h/t)(2t/[1 year])S f l = 10 10 W. Total energy storage in floods ρgh 2 (2t/[1 year])S f l = 10 16 J. Total energy storage in storms is estimated assuming a storm lasting on average 10 days and there being globally 40 storms each year [55] with total energy ρ a V 2 HL 2 = 10 17 J, where H = 10 km is height of the atmosphere and L = 100 km is storm's radius where V 30 m s −1 . Total storm power is ρ a V 3 L 2 = 3 × 10 14 W, global surface-specific power density divides this number by the Earth's surface area S E . 9 The biotic pump mechanism regulates precipitation and winds. The dry air can ascend and descend in the atmosphere of Earth with zero net power expenditure; in contrast, water vapor condenses as it ascends, disappears from the gas phase and returns to the ground surface in the liquid or solid form. This water vapor disappearance from the gas phase creates a vertical pressure gradient (a deviation from the hydrostatic equilibrium) that acts as a vertical force pushing the air upward. Work of this force per unit time represents the power of the biotic pump air circulation [53] . The nearly instantaneous restoration of the hydrostatic equilibrium of the air occurs at the expense of the horizontal air inflow, mostly from the adjacent oceans. In a steady state, this incoming flow of moist air increases the precipitation rate over the forests by the magnitude of the river runoff. How to harmonize the fluxes of evaporation and precipitation such that their difference is equal to the amount of moisture needed to compensate the river runoff-at the same time minimizing the occurrences of hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts-represents one of the most complex processes of the biotic regulation of the environment. In intact forests, fluctuations of precipitaton are suppressed by the biotic pump mechanism [41, 42] . The energy store in the atmosphere is given by 10 3 Pa is partial pressure of atmospheric water vapor. Total store is given by the product of p v h γ S f o = 10 20 J, where h γ = 5 km is the scale height for the vertical distribution of relative partial pressure of water vapor in the gravitational field [53] and S f o = 10 13 m 2 is the total global area of intact forest landscapes [56] . Decay time is the turnover time of water in the atmosphere. Mean power of wind associated with condensation rate controlled by forests is\n"," is the universal gas constant and T∼300 K is absolute temperature. The estimate of local power assumes that precipitation events on average take about one tenth of the time. 10 Characteristics are estimated of the atomic bomb (Little Boy) dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. The bomb with mass of 4.4 t contained 64 kg of enriched uranium. Blast yield is 15 kt of TNT (63 × 10 12 J). Initial radius of explosion is taken as 100 m. 11 The fission of one atom of uranium-235 releases on average 200 MeV (3 × 10 −11 J) with taking into account the decay of its fragments or 83 × 10 12 J per kilogram of 235 U. For low-enriched uranium (3 to 5% concentration of uranium-235), which is usually used as fuel for thermal-neutron reactors at nuclear power plants, it corresponds to the energy storage of about 3 × 10 12 J per kilogram of uranium. Although uranium is quite widespread in nature, only a relatively small portion of it is concentrated in deposits that are economically profitable for industrial development and use in nuclear energetics. Identified resources in situ recoverable at a cost not exceeding 260 USD per kilogram of uranium are estimated to be ∼10 7 t [57] . Since natural uranium contains about 0.7% of fissile isotope 235 U, total storage of energy is given by 0.007 × 10 10 kg × 3 × 10 12 J/kg∼2 × 10 20 J. Presently, there are about 450 nuclear power reactors in operation worldwide with generating electric-power capacity of 4 × 10 11 W. The average efficiency of conversion of heat to electric power is about 30%. Total (global) power of nuclear reactors is estimated as 10 12 W, while the mean power per unit surface area is 10 12 W/[5 × 10 8 km 2 ]∼2 × 10 −3 W m −2 , where the Earth's surface area S E is taken into account. A typical nuclear power station generates electricity at a rate of ∼10 9 W. Taking into account that a nuclear reactor core has an effective radius of 3 m, one can estimate the local surface-specific power of nuclear reactor as 10 9 W/[3 m] 2 ∼10 8 W m −2 . Nuclear stations are designed for at least a 40-year operating life.\n"," In a search for quantitative criteria of life's orderliness and complexity, a proposition was put forward by Chaisson [18] , see also Chaisson [15, 19, 20] that evolutionary progress and an increase of complexity with time in both animate and inanimate nature is reflected in the magntiude of the energy rate density. Assuming, additionally, that \"complexity generally increases with evolution\" [19] , higher energy rate densities in organisms that appeared later in the evolution were interpreted as a correlation between energy rate density and complexity.\n"," Here, we reconsider these estimates and their more recent interpretations [13] to show that there is no evidence for any systematic large-scale changes in mass-or volume-specific energy rate density in the course of biological evolution. In the biological context, individual rate of energy consumption is called metabolic rate, so these terms will be used here interchangeably. In addition, since the density of living matter is close to the density of liquid water ρ = 10 3 kg m −3 , mass m and volume V in living objects are related as m = ρV, thus mass-and volume-specific rates differ by a constant ρ. Figure 2 Chaisson [15] summarized his previous estimates, according to which the more complex plants with their metabolic rate of about 1 W kg −1 evolved from the more primitive protists that presumably had a lower metabolic rate of about 0.1 W kg −1 . The latter figure was obtained by Chaisson [18] (p. 138), see also Chaisson [20] , for the biosphere as a whole by dividing the global rate of photosynthesis F by global plant mass. Using modern data, this estimate can be obtained as\n"," Here, M = 450 GtC is the total plant mass in the biosphere in carbon units [46] , F = 200 GtC yr −1 is the global gross primary productivity, K C = 42 × 10 6 J (kgC) −1 is the energy content of organic matter [58] . Chaisson [20] used a lower value for plant biomass, 1200 Gt instead of 450 GtC ≈ 4500 Gt and a lower value for the biosphere energy consumption (10 21 erg s −1 = 10 14 W instead of FK C = 3 × 10 14 W) to obtain q b = 9 × 10 −2 W kg −1 .\n"," Chaisson [15] Figure 2 , see also Table 3 of Chaisson [19] , Figure 6 of Chaisson [20] , attributed q b = 0.1 W kg −1 to protists and referred to it as \"valid for the great majority of Earth's lower plant life\". In Table 3 of Chaisson [19] , it is stated that examples of such low energy rate density is provided by \"phytoplankton, algae.\" This is incorrect. The low value of q b (1) is due to the fact that most part of plant biomass is wood, which is metabolically inactive e.g., [46, 59] . Wood performs mechanical functions not related to the biochemical energy conversion. To estimate the energy consumption of plants per unit wood mass is similar to estimating the energy consumption of birds per unit mass of their nests or energy consumption of the civilization per unit mass of buildings. In the ocean, plants lack such metabolically inactive parts. Global biomass of oceanic phytoplankton M p ≈ 1.3 GtC is several hundred times lower than M. With gross primary production of the ocean about F p ≈ F/2 ≈ 100 GtC yr −1 , mean mass-specific photosynthetic rate of phytoplankton is\n"," This value for phytoplankton is significantly higher than the values quoted by Chaisson [15] [ Figure 2 and references therein] for the higher plants like gymnosperms and angiosperms (0.5-1 W kg −1 ). It falls on the upper range of mass-specific metabolic rates of life as a whole ( Figure 2 ) and coincides with the metabolic rate of human brain, which in young healthy adults constitutes around 1.3 µmol O 2 min −1 g −1 [60, 61] , which corresponds to 10 W kg −1 assuming 20 J (ml O 2 ) −1 .\n"," Direct measurements of metabolic rates in phytoplankton and protists confirm that these organisms do not have lower metabolic rates than the higher plants and animals ( Figure 2) . Notably, even if we calculate the metabolic rate of higher plants per unit mass of their photosynthetic tissue, still for plants on land we obtain a mean figure of about 1 W kg −1 , since the biomass of green leaves is about ten times larger than phytoplankton biomass Supplementary Information Bar-On et al. [46] , while gross primary productivity on land is about the same as it is in the ocean. This is also consistent with direct estimates of respiration rates in green leaves (Figure 2 ).

Pink shading denotes the proposed optimal range for life's functioning, approximately between 1 and 10 W kg −1 [58, 62] . Red solid lines are the allometric dependencies of q on body mass m for groups of heterotrophic species from Table 1 of Makarieva et al. [58] , gray dotted lines are the same dependencies for Q = qm. The thinner red line for Protozoa represents starved cells from Ikeda [63] [58] . Green solid line is the mass-specific rate of dark respiration in green leaves depending on leaf thickness l calculated from the data of Wright et al. [64] . Linear size l (upper horizontal axis) and body mass m (lower horizontal axis) relate as l = (m/ρ) 1/3 . The dependencies for the mass-specific brain metabolic rate in ectotherms and endotherms on body mass (measured in vivo, violet solid line, and estimated indirectly, violet dashed lines) are constructed using the data of Mink et al. [65] . See Section 6 for details.\n"," In a more recent analysis, Kempes et al. [13] recognized that there is no consistent change of mass-specific metabolic rate across all life. Kempes et al. [13] wrote that while \"multicellular life obeys a certain economy of scale: as organisms grow larger, the metabolic rate required to support a unit of mass is decreasing and larger mammals support more tissues for the same amount of energy\", more recently \"it has been observed that this scaling relationship is not preserved across all the taxa of life.\" Indeed, Makarieva et al. [58] established that \"mean metabolic rates of major taxonomic groups...converge on...a remarkably small range compared with the 4000-to 65,000-fold difference between the mean metabolic rates of the smallest and largest organisms that would be observed if life as a whole conformed to universal quarter-power or third-power allometric scaling laws.\" The dataset of Makarieva et al. [58] included a large compilation of prokaryote metabolic rates that had not been previously analyzed. Namely, these data for the smallest organisms allowed the generalizations about the metabolic portrait of life to be made.\n"," Kempes et al. [13] did not cite the study of Makarieva et al. [58] , but referred to DeLong et al. [66] who used the data of Makarieva et al. [58] for bacteria, converted them from mass-specific to whole-body basis and observed that the scaling exponent in bacteria, listed in Table 1 of Makarieva et al. [58] , becomes greater than unity when the allometry is expressed per whole-body mass. Converting those data back to the mass-specific basis, Kempes et al. [13] discussed how the scaling exponent changes with growing body size of the organisms, noting that q first grows with size in prokaryotes, then it remains relatively constant in protists and then declines in larger organisms ( Figure 2) .\n"," However, Makarieva et al. [58] emphasized that the methodological inaccuracy of measuring the link between organismal size and metabolic rate is profoundly different in the unicellular versus the multicellular organisms. In unicells, especially in prokaryotes, it is common to measure metabolic rate of a unit mass (e.g., taking 1 g dry mass of the bacterial suspension). Cell size is not simultaneously measured. Makarieva et al. [58] see Supplementary Information retrieved cell sizes from independent sources, often estimating cell mass from linear cell size. This procedure does not impact the value of mass-specific metabolic rate, but it should profoundly impact the dependence between mass-specific metabolic rate and cell size, especially given that the size of bacterial cells can change depending on their nutrition status (growth, starvation, etc.). This source of error is absent in larger organisms, where metabolic rate is commonly measured on a whole-body basis simultaneously with the body mass.\n"," DeLong et al. [66] and Kempes et al. [13] did not assess the uncertainty associated with the poorly known cell sizes of unicellular organisms; at the moment, their conclusion about the difference in the scaling exponents between prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and higher organisms lacks statistical significance and cannot be meaningfully interpreted. A more up-to-date analysis of Ikeda [63] controlling for the physiological state in Protozoa indicates a decline in mass-specific metabolic rate with growing body size that is not distinguishable from what is observed in the groups of larger organisms (Figure 2 , thin red line).\n"," In summary, given that the low q b (1) assumed to characterize the lower life forms in the analyses of Chaisson [15] and previous work appears to be a miscalculation, while phytoplankton q p (2) falls instead on the upper border of all life energy rate densities, little support remains for a progressive increase in energy rate densities or any other consistent change in metabolic allometry with evolution ( Figure 2 ), see also analyses by Ikeda [63] , Johnson et al. [67] , Kiørboe and Hirst [68] , Hatton et al. [69] .\n"," Instead, since within evolutionary close groups of organisms the mass-specific metabolic rate declines with growing body size, while evolution tends to produce larger body sizes from smaller ones, the more recently evolved bigger forms within a group face the danger of leaving the life's metabolic optimum range of 1-10 W kg −1 [58] . Once this happens, the bigger forms with low q could lose competitiveness and be forced out from the biosphere if a new group in the same body size interval evolves that has managed to elevate its rate back to the optimal range. In this context, Chaisson [15] 's proposition that endotherms who elevated their q rates above those of the similarly sized ectotherms might have been more evolutionarily advanced, at least in some aspects, remains meaningful. Figure 3 displays the interplay between metabolic optimality and ecological dominance by comparing two groups of species, lizards [70] and mammals [69, 71] . The green squares indicate population energy consumption of several hundred populations of mammalian species world over (mostly mainland) with a geometric mean of 3 × 10 −4 W m −2 and half of all values confined between 0.9 × 10 −4 and 12 × 10 −4 W m −2 . (Population energy consumption J is equal to population density (individuals per unit area or inverse area per one individual) multiplied by individual metabolic rate Q, J = NQ, see Methods). The red circles in Figure 3a show 198 lizard populations on the mainland, i.e., where the reptiles have to co-exist with mammals. The geometric mean energy consumption rate of a mainland lizard population is 2 × 10 −5 W m −2 with half of all values confined between 0.4 × 10 −5 and 14 × 10 −5 W m −2 . The population energy consumption by mammals is more than an order of magnitude higher than that of mainland lizards. On the ecosystem level, lizards are precluded from claiming the same amount of energy resources as mammals. Things turn different on isands, where the competition with mammals is significantly reduced [70] . The blue circles in Figure 3b show population energy consumption in 148 island populations of lizards-compared to the mainland, it rises to 3 × 10 −4 W m −2 with half of all values confined between 0.7 × 10 −4 and 16 × 10 −4 W m −2 . Remarkably, the geometric mean values of population energy consumption in mammals and island lizards practically coincide. These data are consistent with the idea that the metabolically suboptimal lizards lose to mammals in the competition for ecosystem energy resources but re-gain their share of resources where this competition weakens or disappears altogether.\n"," During evolution, the endotherms could have forced out some of the ectotherms with suboptimal metabolic rates (Figure 2 ) from their ecological niches causing their extinction-either by themselves or at the backstage of major environmental cataclysms. (For example, the metabolically 'sub-optimal' dinosaurs, whose metabolic levels continue to be debated, see e.g., [72] [73] [74] and references therein, could have been outcompeted by the evolutionarily young metabolically optimal mammals.) Figure 3 illustrates a \"metabolic footprint\" of how this could have happened. Further insights into ecological dominance and metabolic optimality are provided by consideration of individual surface-specific energy consumption rates as dependent on the organism's body size.\n"," If, generally, the volume-and mass-specific metabolic rate q is size-invariant across life (Figure 2) , then the surface-specific metabolic rate (or surface-specific energy rate density) j = Q/S = qρl 3 /l 2 = ρql, where S is the area of the organism's projection on the ground surface, should grow linearly with linear size l of the organism. The flux of energy via the body surface of the smallest organisms like 1 µm bacteria is about 10 −3 W m −2 , while the biggest organisms like endotherms consume up to 10 3 W m −2 (Figure 4a ). In between lie the characteristic values of net primary productivity P∼1 W m −2 that plants generate using the energy of solar photons. The critical linear size l c = P/(ρq)∼10 −3 m divides all life into the small and the big, the immotile and the locomotive, the ecologically sustainable and the ecologically unstable [28, 62] . Figure 2 . The dashed line shows a characteristic value of primary productivity P = 1 W m −2 ; (b) share β of ecosystem energy flux consumed by heterotrophs from a given body size interval in stable ecosystems on land (dashed contour histogram) [28, 62] and in the ocean (solid contour histogram) [75] . The lower β values for the largest organisms in the ocean compared to land might be related to over-fishing, which reduced fish biomass in some body size intervals by at least an order of magnitude see, e.g., [76] . Note the logarithmic scale of the vertical axis in (b).\n"," Organisms of linear size smaller than l c consume less power than the biosphere is able to generate, j = ρql < P, per unit area of their projection on the Earth's surface (∼l 2 ). Such organisms do not need to move actively or destroy live plants. They can satisfy their energetic needs by sitting and waiting for the dead plant parts falling down to become their food. Like plants themselves, such organisms can form a continuous cover, e.g., in the form of bacterial mats or fungi mycelia.\n"," Conversely, species larger than the critical body size cannot sit and wait. They require more food per unit area per unit time than the biosphere is able to produce. Such organisms have to move collecting biomass synthesized by plants over a large home territory H exceeding their body projection area S = l 2 by many orders of magnitude, H S. Importantly, these bigger locomotive organisms must feed on live plant biomass. Indeed, at any moment of time, they occupy only a tiny portion S/H 1 of their feeding territory and thus cannot compete for dead plant biomass with the immobile heterotrophs (bacteria and fungi) that are ubiquitously present. This explains the pattern noted by Cebrian [77] that vertebrate (i.e., bigger) detritivores are rare and their role is insignificant. The smallest heterotrophs, on the other hand, should preferentially consume dead plant biomass (i.e., they should be detritivorous) because live plants defend themselves biochemically, and it would be costly to overcome their defense. The bigger organisms have no choice but to accept these costs.\n"," Plants represent the energetic basis for ecosystem functioning-indeed, \"the removal of primary producers leaves no system at all\" [78] . As the bigger organisms consume live plant biomass, the big herbivores as an ecological and evolutionary group present a persistent threat to ecosystem stability. Fires also consume live plant biomass at a rate that is comparable to herbivores in disturbed ecosystems ( Table 1 , column 6) representing some of the more voracious \"plant-feeders\" [79] . However, unlike living organisms, fires do not evolve. Thus, a natural ecosystem can in principle evolve to a state where it becomes resistant to fires \"once and for all\", by employing efficient water retention and moisture transport mechanisms. Meanwhile any resistance the plants would evolve against herbivores, e.g., [79] Figure 2d ,e, can be in principle overcome by evolution of the big herbivores themselves. This does not mean that any big herbivore the evolution has produced will destroy its own ecosystem by overfeeding. However, there are no general ecological, biological, or physical laws that would prohibit the occasional self-destructive increase in population numbers of big herbivores.\n"," Persistent, stable ecosystems, both on land and in the ocean that apparently managed to keep population densities of big herbivores in check allocate a very low portion of total ecosystem flux to the biggest organisms (Figure 4b) . The largest share of ecosystem productivity (80-90%) goes via the detrital channel of the smallest heterotrophs, bacteria, fungi, and eukaryotic unicells. These organisms keep their mass-specific metabolic rates within the optimal range ( Figure 2 ) and do not exceed the critical linear size l c associated with ecological instability (Figure 4a ). Together with plants, they represent the main working unit of life whose functioning is stabilized in accordance with the law of large numbers.\n"," Invertebrates of intermediate size are still metabolically optimal (Figure 2 ), but their size is already supercritical (Figure 4a ). These organisms are allocated a smaller share of about 10% of ecosystem energy flux (Figure 4b) . Finally, the biggest organisms, vertebrates, have fallen out of the optimal metabolic range and increased their body size by two orders over the critical l c . This double suboptimality is associated with the lowest share of ecosystem energy flux (less than 1%) allocated to these organisms in stable conditions (Figure 4b) .\n"," Recently in a discussion of the ecological role of big animals opened in the Russian Journal of Ecosystem Ecology, e.g., [75, [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] Hatton and Galbraith [86] suggested that the idea of an ecological and environmental disruption associated with big animals might be in contradiction with the approximate constancy of population energy consumption observed in different-sized vertebrate species, as established by Hatton et al. [69] [their Figure 2E ]. To address this criticism, we first note that the pattern shown in Figure 4b is consistent with the data of Hatton et al. [69] and Hatton and Galbraith [86] . Indeed, share β of ecosystem energy flux consumed by all organisms in a given body size interval is equal to\n"," where N i (m −2 ) is population density of the i-th species, Q (W) is whole-body metabolic rate of individuals in this species, β i = N i Q i /P is population energy consumption of the i-th species, n is the total number of species in the considered body size interval, and P (W m −2 ) is ecosystem primary productivity. If population energy consumption β i is independent of body size, as Figure 2E of Hatton et al. [69] suggests, the decline of β with increasing body size will occur at the expense of the declining number n of the bigger species (e.g., in most ecosystems, there are more species of rodents than of big ungulates), as also recognized by Hatton and Galbraith [86] . (Note that if N i is expressed in ind m −2 , Q should be expressed in W ind −1 and body mass m in kg ind −1 such that the relationship between whole-body Q and mass-specific q metabolic rates, Q = qm, is preserved.) Furthermore, any global compilation of β i = N i Q i /P necessarily includes population density data from significantly perturbed ecosystems including some overgrazed nature reserves in Africa [87] . In such ecosystems, population energy consumption by big animals can be artificially elevated by providing extra food to the protected species. Controlling for the degree of anthropogenic disturbance may change the size-related pattern for β i from the current size-invariance towards lower values at larger body sizes. Makarieva et al. [87] using the data of Damuth [71] showed that the scaling of N i is different in open (savanna, presumably less stable) versus closed (forests, presumably more stable) ecosystems: in closed canopy ecosystems, N i declines more rapidly with growing body size.\n"," (We note in passing that in their pan-eukaryotic compilation of N i Q i estimates Hatton et al. [69] included multicellular plants, which, unlike the remaining species of the biosphere, are known to contain large amounts of metabolically inactive structural tissues (wood). This raises the problem of defining the metabolically relevant whole-plant mass, which is smaller than total plant mass. Relocating the relatively high plant β i towards smaller body sizes in Figures 2E and 1C of, respectively, Hatton et al. [69] and Hatton and Galbraith [86] , would have made the overall dependence of N i Q i on body size across all eukaryotes more negative.)\n"," Finally, the logic of Hatton and Galbraith [86] 's objection that big animals are not dangerous since their share of consumption declines with body size such that they may not claim all ecosystem productivity does not contradict the statement that big animals are potentially dangerous. As long as big animals are confined within the ecological corridor of relatively low β as outlined in Figure 4b , they do not pose a threat to the ecosystem functioning; the ecosystem is balanced. However, since big herbivores are physiologically selected to destroy live plants, it appears to be just a matter of time when a big species with a sufficiently destructive potential arises in the course of evolution. Homo sapiens appears to be a conspicuous example [88] .\n"," While there is no general increase in energy rate density q in plants and animals to \"parallel the emergence of major evolutionary stages on the scale of life's history\" cf. [15] , the human civilization does consume a relatively large amount of energy per unit time per unit live mass. For 2015, the global energy consumption P c = 17 × 10 12 W (550 quadrillion btu per year) [43] divided by cumulative mass of all human bodies M h = 4 × 10 11 kg [46] gives q c = P c /M h = 43 W kg −1 for the modern civilization. This is more than an order of magnitude higher than a typical q h ≈ 1.5 W kg −1 of the human body. In countries consuming several times more energy power than the global average, the ratio q c /q h may well reach 200.\n"," Do those high energy rate densities, q c ∼10 2 W kg −1 , testify for an increased complexity and evolutionary advancement our civilization could be proud of? Our species appears to be using so much energy because a certain part of the Homo sapiens population was historically forced out of their natural ecological niche (a warm tropical climate with a high biological productivity). With technological progress they have attempted to recreate the \"paradise\" conditions in a significantly more hostile and less productive environment of the higher latititudes [14] . This requires a lot of energy.\n"," However, such elevated rates are not unprecedented in the living world. Growing bacteria and animal tissues during peak activity, e.g., during flight, consume energy at rates of up to several thousand Watts per kilogram [89] . However, living organisms do not normally maintain such rates for a prolonged period of time. This indicates that such levels of energy consumption are not sustainable in the long term.\n"," Likewise, while global rates of synthesis and decomposition of organic matter in the biosphere balance each other with a high accuracy ensuring life's persistence in the long term, the energy consumption of the modern civilization mostly derives from fossil fuels that are not renewable. All major mineral and energy resources that our civilization consumes at an ever increasing rate are in decline. Unlike in the rest of life, here we are apparently dealing with an unsteady process of an explosion-like exponentially accelerating energy consumption that will end in the depletion of energy resources and the collapse of the corresponding energy-consuming structure. The instantaneous unsteady rate of energy consumption can be significantly higher than our civilization's q c in many processes like nuclear bomb explosions that cannot claim high orderliness (Table 1) . Biospheric processes, in contrast, are characterized by a slow-down of potentially explosion-like processes. In particular, the biotic control of water vapor condensation in natural forests stabilizes the terrestrial water cycle against such weather extremes with explosion-like energy release as hurricanes and tornadoes [39, 40, 42] .\n"," Per unit surface area, the energy consumption of our civilization J c = P c /S E = 0.03 W m −2 , S E = 5 × 10 14 m 2 , is about an order of magnitude lower than the global gross photosynthetic power on Earth FK C /S E ∼0.6 W m −2 . However, it exceeds the ecologically permissible energy quota for animals of human size by more than an order of magnitude (Figure 4b) , illustrating the significant disruptive potential of our species with respect to destabilising the biosphere. (Direct consumption of primary productivity of the biosphere (food, cattle fodder, wood) by humans appears, in power units, to be of the same order of magnitude as consumption of fossil fuels which mostly determines J c [90] . Fires provide a similar disturbance removing annually about 4% of net primary productivity on land (Table 1) .)\n"," The structure of anthropogenic energy consumption reveals its low information content. About one third of all energy flow is spent on transport. Transport vehicles represent macroscopic objects whose behavior can be characterized by just a few variables like the velocity vector of its movement. Its environmental function consists of consuming petrol and releasing carbon dioxide. In contrast, the continuous cover of plants and immobile heterotrophs covering the Earth's surface consists of microscopic memory cells that independently censor environmental conditions on a fine scale and react to environmental perturbations in a non-random way. Each such cell possesses an information-processing capacity comparable with that of a modern personal computer [7] . For example, the functioning of soil biota can change the life-time of organic compounds turning normally short-lived substances like proteins (that rapidly degrade under laboratory conditions) into long-lived ones and vice versa [91] . The meaning of \"Once there were bacteria, now there is New York\" may be precisely the opposite to what this phrase is usually invoked to imply [5] .\n"," Generally, living organisms impose control over their external environment via the surface of their bodies. With the growing size of compact animal bodies, the relative number of body cells that are in contact with the external milieu diminishes inversely proportionally to linear body size l:\n"," where S = l 2 and V = l 3 are the animal body area and volume, s = l 2 cell and v = l 3 cell are the mean area and volume of cells in the animal body.\n"," For large animals cells that interact with the external environment represent a negligible proportion of total body cells, e.g., η = 10 −4 for l = 0.5 m and l cell = 50 µm. Information flux in the animal body is proportional to total energy consumption of the animal. The larger the animal, the smaller the share of its information flux it can spend to participate in the biotic regulation of the external environment which allows for its very existence. Large animals use the available fluxes of energy and information almost exclusively to maintain the orderliness of their internal milieu rather than the external environment [14] . Failure to process environmental information at a sufficient rate leads to ecological misbehavior and demise. In certain aspects, this can be compared to the economic phenomenon of a decline of big monopolies that focus too much on themselves while paying insufficient attention to, and failing to predict, the market trends their smaller competitors eagerly monitor [92] .\n"," When large animals begin to dominate the ecosystem, the environment left without biotic control rapidly degrades. As it degrades, so does the efficiency of competitive interaction, which can no longer stabilize the genetic information of life. Thus, the spontaneous occurence, in the course of evolution, of yet bigger life's forms may not represent some evolutionary advancement, but, on the contrary, can be manifestation of degradation (ageing) of life's algorithm as a whole. Life is trying to counteract this decay process by limiting the energy resources allocated to big animals ( Figure 4b ).\n"," When these limits are overcome by whatever reason, the environment degrades locally ( Figure 5 ) or globally depending on the spatial scale where the limits have been broken. \n"," The dependence reported by Wright et al. [64] Table 1 and Supplementary Information, log 10 (q d /q d ) = −1.04 log 10 (LMA/LMA), where q d and LMA are, respectively, the rate of dark respiration per unit dry leaf mass and dry leaf mass per unit leaf surface area, q d = 9.7 nmol O 2 (g dry mass) −1 s −1 , LMA = 128 (g dry mass) m −2 , corresponds to log 10 (q/q) = −1.04 log 10 (l/l), where q is the rate of dark respiration per unit live mass and l is leaf thickness estimated from LMA, q = 1.45 W kg −1 , l = 4.3 × 10 −4 m. (Assuming 30% dry mass content in live mass and live matter density ρ = 10 6 g m −3 , we have l [m] = LMA/0.3 [(g dry mass) m −2 ]/ρ; assuming 20 J per 1 ml O 2 [58] we have q [W kg −1 \n"," The data for starved Protozoa from Ikeda [63] , Table S1 -1 (thin red line in Figure 2 ) were corrected to 25 • C assuming Q 10 = 2 as in Makarieva et al. [58] by multiplying the original metabolic rates by 2 (25 • C−T)/10 • C , where T is the measurement temperature in degrees Celsius. Note that, in Table S1 -1 of Ikeda [63] , the wet mass of cells is mistakenly represented in nanograms (10 −6 mg), it should be picograms instead (10 −9 mg) to match the (correct) values for cell volumes. Data for starved cells correspond to those rows in Table S1 -1 of Ikeda [63] , where variables \"GR\" and \"UNS\" are both zeros.\n"," The violet solid line in Figure 2 describes five mammalian species where oxygen consumption of the brains was measured in vivo [65] Figure 1 , the violet dashed lines also include the remaining indirectly obtained estimates from Table 1 of Mink et al. [65] .\n"," In Figure 3 , lizard population densities N (m −2 , an inverse area per one individual) and body masses m were taken from Appendix S1 of Novosolov et al. [70] (148 island and 198 mainland populations). Mammalian population densities N and body masses m were taken from the Supplementary Data of Hatton et al. [69] (2663 populations for 608 species). Given the highly uneven numbers of populations studied for different mammal species, a mean population density for each mammalian species was estimated by taking a geometric mean of all population densities for the considered species. To obtain population energy consumption J = NQ (W m −2 ), each lizard population density and each mean mammalian population density were multiplied by field metabolic rate Q f (W) as established by Nagy [93] for reptiles, Q f /Q 0 = 0.196(m/m 0 ) 0.889 , and mammals, Q f /Q 0 = 4.82(m/m 0 ) 0.734 , respectively, where Q 0 = 1 kJ day −1 = 0.0116 W, m 0 = 1 g.\n"," Note the relationship between population energy consumption J = NQ and individual surface-specific energy consumption j = ρql = Q/S (Figure 4a) , where S = l 2 is the projection area of the individual on the ground surface: J = jSN.\n"," We have considered several key statements of the biotic regulation of the environment that views life and environment as inseparable entities. In closed non-equilibrium systems, entropy diminishes. In open non-equilibrium systems that consume ordered energy, entropy may remain constant and the systems can be stabilized in the non-equilibrium state as long as this energy inflow is available. For example, as long as solar energy generates the fluxes of evaporation from the oceanic surface, there will be hurricanes.\n"," However, for living systems, their order (measured as the stabilization of the genetic information against decay) is not directly related to the availability of external energy supply. If the organism does not eat, it will die. However, even if it does eat, it will die. This allows the formulation of a constraint on the information entropy [6] : if the external energy flow is low ordered compared to the information carrier, the information content can be stabilized if and only if this information carries a program of such stabilization. The measure of how disordered external energy is as compared to the ordered object in question is provided by the probability of spontaneous arisal of this object in the presence of this energy. Unlike hurricanes, living objects never arise spontaneously.\n"," The genetic program of life must carry a subunit about how to recognize and delete the copies with erroneous information. The process of recognition of erroneous copies represents a measurement. This measurement is performed by classical objects (individuals) that all age and die. The deletion of erroneous copies must involve their deprivation of essential resources like energy. Thus, the efficiency of the stabilization program depends on the environmental properties ( Figure 1 ). Under conditions of unlimited resource abundance, the deletion of erroneous copies (and defective individuals) from the population would be impossible [28] . Individuals incapable of environmental regulation will propagate at the expense of consuming the available resources until they force out all \"regulators\", after which the biotic regulation discontinues and the environment degrades.\n"," A theoretical question is whether it is possible to conceive a program that will sustain itself eternally (provided the solar energy flux and other basic planetary characteristics remain constant). This is not obvious. The appearance of big animals, and generally the body size growth in the course of evolution, shows that, when the cells of the multicellular body act in concert (mutually correlated), they can at least sometimes outcompete the small organisms that represent independent individuals. This increase in individual competitive capacity comes hand in hand with the ability of large animals to destroy live plant biomass ( Figure 5) .\n"," Apparently, both in the ocean and on land, the large-scale evolutionary increase in body size-from unicellular organisms to multicellular invertebrates to yet bigger vertebrates-was paralleled with a decline of the share of ecosystem energy consumption allocated to them-from, respectively, ∼100% to ∼10% to ∼1% (Figure 4b) . It is most pronounced in the ocean [75] , where there are no large primary consumers: the biggest animals reside at the top of the food pyramid with extremely low population energy consumption.\n"," The energetic deprivation of the biggest animals, and the destabilization their high population numbers can invoke, suggest that the spontaneous increase in body size during life's evolution may represent a drawback of the life's algorithm as a whole, a sign of its ageing and losing order. Given that the key function of life is to maintain an environment where it can stabilize itself, big animals with their low surface-to-volume ratio are unable to perform efficient environmental regulation but are potentially capable of destruction.\n"," Brains, and the human brain in particular, are tissues that display a close to optimum volume-specific energy rate density ( Figure 2) . Apparently, having discovered external energy resources, the humanity has found itself in a temporary state of energy abundance and has been so far disturbing and destroying the biosphere. However, it is in principle possible that with use of their metabolically optimal brains humans will realize the principles of life stability and implement them into their culture. The danger of resource abundance for population organization has been intuitively recognized in some cultures, whereby the belongings of the deceased are destroyed preventing the accumulation of wealth [94] . However, a scientific recognition of the danger of abundance is required. If this is done, then the degradation of life could be stopped via human knowledge.\n"," The biotic regulation concept gives meaning to the information content of the genome: the information makes sense if it fits the general program of keeping the environment stable. This information can be copied infinitely without loss as it is written on quantum carriers (DNA molecules) that do not age. The combination of quantum and classical properties is a distinct feature of life as compared to processes in the inanimate nature. In modern computers, programs are written on macroscopic non-quantum memory cells. Errors that arise in these programs do not obey the quantum law of radioactive decay. This copying does not necessarily produce identical copies. Technical problems or improper handling of physical data carriers can lead to disappearance of all copies. However, program users are able to recognize and delete erroneous, virus-affected programs and by doing so they act as the classical individuals in the natural biota.\n"," The modern civilization is in this context fully classical. It does not contain any quantum program of the stationary norm and how to prevent decay. Life, on the other hand, does not contain any information about the stationary state of the civilization. In the inanimate nature, there cannot be sustainable development; there is only the decay of an ordered state that determines the direction of time. The irreversibility of time is manifested in the impossibility of creating perpetuum mobiles of the second kind-one cannot get work from heat at the same temperature. In the living nature there is only one example of sustainable development-it is the programmed development of an embryo from the egg or a plant from the seed. This development occurs strictly in line with the genetic program of the species that determines the decay channels for energy transformations; and which processes must occur at each stage. The normal process of development, as well as deviations from the norm, are well defined. This sustainable development according to the genetic program formed during the billions of years of biological evolution culminates in the stationary life stage of the adult individual. This life continues for a known period of time and ends with the decay and death of the individual. For most species, the biosphere provides sustainable conditions for the development of all generations of organisms for several million years.\n"," In contrast to biological species, human civilization does not have a program of sustainable development. Such a program can be created only on the basis of fundamental research. In a broad sense, sustainable development of the civilization can be understood as a steady-state process of cultural change: the civilization continues to evolve culturally (in particular, scientifically and technologically), but the environmental conditions persist that enable all generations to thrive [95] [96] [97] . Currently, attempts at climate stabilization are primarily based on technology and aimed at mitigating carbon dioxide emissions. Meanwhile, protection and conservation of natural ecosystems are viewed as a related but separate goal. Reflecting this duality, there are different international organizations dealing with the presumably different sets of problems, e.g., the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services [98] . The biotic regulation concept indicates that environmental sustainability cannot be achieved without understanding and quantifying the genetically encoded regulatory functions of the natural ecosystems. A wide international effort is needed to study the stabilizing climate impact of the still remaining least disturbed natural ecosystems [99] [100] [101] . Long-term climate stability, and thus sustainability on a planetary scale, is contingent upon the existence of vast areas where natural ecosystems are allowed to operate maintaining the environmental conditions in a suitable for life state. \n","Score: 10.324393759246144\n","\n","Title: \n","Body Text: S of July 10, 2003, 438 cases (250 probable, 188 suspect) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were reported in Canada, 375 (85.3%) of which occurred in Ontario. 1 The majority of cases in Ontario occurred in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). SARS has resulted in unprecedented apprehension in the local community and severe economic harm to local business and tourism. More importantly, it has challenged health care workers to use effective infection control measures. In the present article, we will discuss the infection control guidelines for the anesthesiologist that were adopted by our institution, the rationale behind them and the impact of the SARS outbreak on anesthesiologists in Toronto.\n"," illness was called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) with a case definition (Table I) from the World Health Organization (WHO). 3 On March 12, 2003 , WHO issued a global alert in relation to clusters of SARS. 4 In Toronto, the first documented case was a 78-yr-old woman who had travelled to Hong Kong on February 13 with her husband. 5 In Hong Kong, she and her husband stayed at a hotel at the same time and on the same floor as the Guangdong physician from whom the outbreak in Hong Kong originated. On returning to Toronto on February 23, she stayed in her apartment, which she shared with family members. Two days later, she became ill and died at home on March 5, 2003 . Several of the family subsequently developed respiratory symptoms. The 43-yr-old son was admitted to the emergency department of a community hospital in Scarborough that became the epicentre of the Toronto outbreak. By the end of April, 262 SARS cases (143 probable, 119 suspected) and 21 deaths had been reported in Ontario, the majority in the GTA. 6 All these cases could be traced back to the original index patient. On April 23, WHO issued a travel advisory warning for Toronto, which was removed one week later. On May 14, Toronto was removed from the list of areas affected by SARS as no new probable case had been reported since April 19. However, another cluster of SARS patients was discovered on May 23, 2003. 7 The second cluster was traced to a 96-yr-old man who underwent surgery for a fractured pelvis in a hospital in North York on April 19. While in hospital he developed SARS but it was managed as postoperative pneumonia. He infected several other patients in his ward, including a woman who was later transferred to a rehabilitation hospital. This resulted in a further 118 cases in the GTA as of July 10, 2003. 1 Eventually, on July 2, WHO removed Toronto from the list of areas with recent local transmissions.\n"," R Re e--e ex xa am mi in na at ti io on n o of f i in nf fe ec ct ti io on n c co on nt tr ro ol l m me ea as su ur re es s The SARS outbreak is unique in recent history of public health because of its rapidity of transmission, its concentration in health care settings and the large number of health care workers who were infected. In an analysis of a cohort of 144 patients with SARS in the GTA, 73 (51%) were health care workers, 8 including 14 (19%) physicians and 29 (40%) nurses. Anesthesiologists, as specialists in airway management, are at high risk because of frequent exposure to patients' respiratory secretions. Three anesthesiologists in our area were infected. 9 They contracted the disease after tracheal intubation of patients with respi- -high fever (> 38°C) AND -cough or breathing difficulty AND one or more of the following exposures during the ten days prior to onset of symptoms:\n"," -close contact B with a person who is a suspect or probable case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); -history of travel to an area with recent local transmission of SARS -residing in an area with recent local transmission of SARS 2 A person with an unexplained acute respiratory illness resulting in death after 1 November 2002, A but on whom no autopsy has been performed AND one or more of the following exposures during to ten days prior to onset of symptoms:\n"," -close contact, B with a person who is a suspect or probable case of SARS; -history of travel to an area with recent local transmission of SARS -residing in an area with recent local transmission of SARS Probable case 1 A suspect case with radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) on chest\n"," x-ray (CXR). 2 A suspect case of SARS that is positive for SARS coronavirus by one or more assays. 3 A suspect case with autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of RDS without an identifiable cause. ratory failure of unknown cause. These cases occurred in the early stage of the outbreak before SARS was suspected. The anesthesiologists wore surgical facemasks, gowns and gloves but no goggles/visors.\n"," International investigations have revealed important information that prompted health care workers to reexamine the precautionary measures for infection control.\n"," The agent that causes SARS is a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV), unlike any other human or animal virus in the Coronavirus family. 10, 11 The virus can survive for up to 48 hr after drying on plastic surfaces. 12 In Hong Kong the virus survived in urine and feces for at least 24 and 48 hr respectively. In patients with diarrhea, the virus can survive up to four days in the stool sample which has a lower acidity than normal stools. 12 Thus, once the body is exposed to this viral agent, the body surface can be contaminated for an extended time. Similarly, exposed inanimate objects may act as carriers for up to 48 hr.\n"," The virus is spread predominately by infectious droplets and contact. Because of early reports of clusters of cases in community settings such as apartment buildings and the high infection rates among health care workers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Hanoi and Toronto, the etiological agent of SARS was thought to be highly contagious. 13, 14 However, with the exception of 'superspreaders', there is growing evidence that SARS-CoV is only moderately transmissible. 15, 16 The average number of secondary infections generated per case at the start of the epidemic was estimated as 2.7, which is much lower than that for influenza. 17 In some instances, however, a single individual (\"superspreader\") has directly infected a large number of other people. This is exemplified by the Singapore outbreak in which half of the first reported 201 probable cases were infected by five source cases. 18 Despite the discovery of the virus and its genome, it is still uncertain when patients are most infectious and how to identify 'superspreaders'. 19 \n"," In Hong Kong and Toronto, most of the patients infected with SARS had no co-morbid illnesses and half of them (44-51%) were fit health care workers. 8, 20 Approximately one in five (20-23%) patients with SARS required admission to intensive care units (ICU) with or without ventilatory support.\n"," In a detailed analysis of cases identified in the initial outbreak associated with the nosocomial transmission of SARS in the index hospital in Toronto, the case fatality rates were 2.9% and 53.8% for those aged less than or over 60 yr respectively. 1 The case-fatality rate was calculated by dividing the cumulative number of deaths within 60 days after symptom onset by the total number of probable and suspect cases. Data from the WHO 21 revealed that the overall case fatality ratio was 14 to 15% and was influenced by age (Table II) . This ratio was estimated by survival analysis based on the individual data from the onset of the illness until death or full recovery.\n"," Early in the Toronto SARS outbreak, full protective gear (goggles, gowns, N95 masks and gloves) was considered to be sufficient to protect health care workers from SARS. In April, a number of health care workers contracted the infection during their care of SARS patients despite increased protective precautions. 22, 23 Experience from Hong Kong suggested that the infection among 'protected' health care worker was related to how well the precautionary measures were used. In a case-control survey, 24 they found no infection in staff using complete precautionary measures, whereas infected staff had omitted at least one of the precautionary measures. This demonstrates how difficult it is to practice and perfect full infection control in view of the long survival ability of the virus outside the body. Additional measures have been suggested. However, most important of all is the 'hypervigilance' of health care workers in practicing infection control measure.\n"," I In nf fe ec ct ti io on n c co on nt tr ro ol l g gu ui id de el li in ne es s f fo or r a an ne es st th he es si ia a Exposure to oral and respiratory secretions at the time of tracheal intubation subjects the anesthesiologist to a serious risk of acquiring the infection. Health organizations and agencies such as WHO, 25 This guideline applies to all surgical patients and is based on long-standing recommendations by Health Canada that masks and eye protection or face shields should be worn where appropriate to protect the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth during procedures and patient care activities likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions. 29 For practical purposes, the anesthetic machine is considered 'dirty' and the anesthetic drug cart as 'clean'. The machine is usually the first area anesthesiologists touch after contact with the patient. A large container is positioned on the anesthesia machine in which all airway equipment (laryngoscope blade and handle, mask, suction catheter, etc.) is placed after use. The container and its contents are removed from the OR as soon as possible following intubation. The contents are separated for cleaning, sterilization or disposal before they are returned to the OR. A second set of equipment including clean masks, laryngoscope handles and blades is immediately available. All steps are taken to keep the anesthesia drug cart 'clean'. The cart is used only after hand-washing or removal of the outer pair of gloves. Thus, the infection control team should be informed about the transfer route. The spread of respiratory droplets from the infected patient should be minimized by the patient wearing a N95 mask without an expiratory valve. Staff involved in the transfer and the care of patients in the OR should take full droplet/contact precautions. Clean surgical scrub suits laundered by the hospital should be worn and personalized hats or hair covers are avoided. The rationale for using alcohol-based hand rub, N95 masks, gowns, gloves and powered respirators in the OR has been reviewed recently. 9 Because the SARS-CoV virus is spread by droplets and can survive on inanimate objects for 48 hr, extra precautions and vigilance are important to avoid contaminating anesthesia equipment or surfaces such as the telephone in the OR. Double gloves are recommended when handling SARS patients. The outer pair is removed after direct patient contact and before touching equipment or furniture in other areas of the room.\n"," Of the precautions recommended above, the use of personal protection systems (PPS) may be the most unfamiliar for anesthesiologists. Although it is not currently recommended by Health Canada, 27 hospitals in Ontario are using PPS according to the directive from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care of Ontario to all Ontario Acute Care Hospitals for high-risk procedures. 28 The PPS adopted in our institution is the powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR 3M, Berkshire, UK) system while other hospitals have purchased the Stryker® T4 (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) PPS. No consensus has been reached regarding which has the better air filtration system. Nonetheless, these systems are considered to be important barriers to protect health care workers during high-risk procedures such as intubation and extubation. The PAPR consists of a beltmounted powered air purifier with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, connected via a tube to a lightweight headpiece (Figures 1 and 2) . The HEPA filter removes particles of 0.3 to 15 µ with an efficiency of 98 to 100%. 30 The lightweight hood or headpiece provides excellent coverage of the head, face and neck. We have several years experience in using the PAPR system in the bronchoscopy suite without disease transmission to health-care workers. There are several important clinical points to remember. First, it takes time, training and assistance to put on the personal protective equipment and the PAPR system properly. Advance warning of a patient in need of tracheal intubation is required in order to prepare properly. Second, the personal protective equipment must be removed in proper sequence to avoid contamination of the users. Third, it is difficult to communicate with each other due to the noise generat-ed by the high flow through the PAPR system. This noisy environment may cause errors due to its potential for miscommunication.\n"," Contaminated protective gear must be removed before transferring the patient to the recovery room. Time should be allowed for the anesthesiologist and assistant to remove contaminated gloves, gowns, face shields or masks and head cover and renew protective precautions at the end of the case.\n"," The anesthesia machine is protected with high efficiency, low volume filters placed in both the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the circuit. Hydrophobic filters are used in our institution as the filtering process is based on pore size and not on hydrostatic charge. The hygroscopic filter based on hydrostatic charge may become overwhelmed when wet and will allow passage of virus. With the filter placed in both limbs of the circuit, the soda lime does not need to be changed but the end-tidal CO 2 sample line and trap must be changed after the case.\n"," Most ORs currently use positive pressure with up to 20 room air exchanges per hour. Because of the high air exchanges in the OR, aerosolized infectious particles will be cleared rapidly. However, those in close contact during a high-risk procedure such as tracheal intubation/extubation may still have a high exposure, and those outside the room may be exposed to infectious aerosols if the door to the OR is left open. Therefore, movement in and out of the OR must be kept to a minimum during the procedure.\n"," Local experience from personnel who contracted SARS during airway instrumentation suggested that patient coughing should be kept at a minimum before, during and after intubation and/or induction of anesthesia. Instrumentation of the airway with either a cuffed endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway is acceptable and should be performed by the most experienced staff available.\n"," Despite the long list of precautions suggested by our institutional guidelines, it is difficult to list details of all the modifications to practice that have occurred. Questions concerning best practice remain. For example: should the pager be clipped on the OR uniform inside the OR? Should we use tape from the roll to secure the endotracheal tube or should the tape be precut? Anesthesiologists are familiar with the importance of vigilance in maintaining patient safety. A similar high level of vigilance is necessary to prevent the spread of this serious infection.\n"," In the second month of the outbreak, a cluster of six health care workers contracted SARS after participating in a difficult and prolonged tracheal intubation. 23 Since then, most hospitals have included anesthesiologists, the specialists in airway management, to assist in the tracheal intubation of SARS patients. To minimize aerosol spread by coughing, intubation is performed in sedated and paralyzed patients. Personnel performing intubation, anesthesiologists and respiratory technicians, must take full precautions including the PAPR FIGURE 2 The powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) system consists of a belt-mounted powered air purifier with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. FIGURE 1 A lightweight headpiece is connected to the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) system via a tube hood, gown, gloves etc., as outlined in the previous section. There must be a well-rehearsed plan and protective clothing, intubating equipment and essential drugs must be provided. Particular care is necessary for the removal of potentially contaminated clothing.\n"," In summary, it is extraordinary that the spread of the infection in the GTA outbreak can be traced to one person with unrecognized SARS. The outbreak disrupted the health care and living in a city the size of Toronto. One hopes for greater vigilance in the future.\n"," Anesthesiologists are unique in their frequent exposure to respiratory secretions and blood. We must pay greater heed of our environment to protect ourselves, our patients and our families from infectious disease.

Deep sequencing from lower respiratory tract samples confirmed infection was caused by a novel coronavirus, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization [1] .\n"," On 11th March 2020, due to the global logarithmic expansion of the cases, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the WHO.\n"," The most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue. Diarrhea was uncommon [2] .\n"," SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be transmitted from person to person mainly through respiratory droplets or close contact [3] . The ocular surface is exposed to the outside environment, which may become a potential gateway for pathogens such as viruses to invade the human body.\n"," Moreover, ACE 2 is a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [4] . ACE 2 has also been detected in the human retina [5] , vascularised retinal pigment epithelium choroid [6] and cornea and conjunctival epithelia [7] .\n"," For these reasons, it's important to evaluate the clinical spectrum of ocular diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n"," Moreover, the exponential increase in the number of Covid-19 cases was like a tsunami for health care companies, which were not ready to face this emergency. Ophthalmology departments were also affected by the reorganization of healthcare services. So, it is necessary to rearrange ophthalmologist routine clinical practice in order to control viral spread and try to maximize patient and health-care provider's safety.\n"," Articles were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published between December 2019 and April 2020.\n"," A total of 9 articles was included.\n"," In a cross-sectional study of Liwen Chen et al., was studied the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of 534 cases of COVID-19 in China [8] .\n"," The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. There was a similar number of men and women (134/ 129 and 134/137, respectively) in the two hospitals.\n"," Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom.\n"," Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular symptoms. The authors explain this due to the fact that COVID-19 patients are more likely to have a lot of time to use electronic products.\n"," Only four patients reported a history of eye disease among the 25 cases-two reported conjunctivitis and two reported dry eye. These 25 patients did not report any other eye disease history or any symptoms associated with intraocular diseases (such as iritis, choroiditis, and retinal disease), which suggests that conjunctivitis may be the primary cause of the conjunctival congestion.\n"," Conjunctival congestion and positive RT-PCR in pharyngeal swabs were found at the same time in four COVID-19 patients.\n"," The conclusion of the study is that the conjunctival swab test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in patients with conjunctival congestion.\n"," Moreover, among the 25 cases with conjunctival congestion, 18 (72%) had a history of hand-eye contact, 13 with frequent contact and 12 who never washed their hands, suggesting that hand-eye contact is possibly a high risk factor.\n"," A study in the New England Journal of Medicine by Zhong Nanshan and other [1] , that analys the clinical features of patients infected with COVID-19, reported nine cases with conjunctival congestion among the 1099 cases enrolled (0.8%).\n"," In a retrospective cohort study by Zohu and others, has been reported 3 cases of conjunctival congestion in 67 COVID-19 patients or suspected cases [9] . Of the cases enrolled in the study, one was positive for the conjunctival sac 2019-nCoV test and two cases were suspicious positive. None of these three patients had ocular symptoms. One patient presented with conjunctivitis as the first symptom but had a negative conjunctival sac 2019-nCoV test. This kind of conjunctivitis has no specific manifestation, and can present in one eye or two eyes. In the early stage, it appears as common conjunctival hyperemia with fewer secretions. It is watery and akin to thin mucus. Occasionally small pieces of conjunctival hemorrhage are seen.\n"," The authors concluded that the incidence of conjunctivitis in patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is not high and that the concept that the virus is transmitted through the conjunctival route it is not supported.\n"," Jianhua Xia and collegues evalueted the presence of coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [10] .\n"," Thirty confirmed novel NCP patients were selected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 26 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. At an interval of 2 to 3 days, tear and conjunctival secretions were collected twice with disposable sampling swabs for reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.\n"," Only one patient with conjunctivitis found viral RNA in his tear fluid and conjunctival secretion twice. The conjunctivitis was characterized by viral conjunctivitis with conjunctival congestion and aqueous secretion.\n"," No viral RNA was detected in the tear fluid and conjunctival secretions of the severe or common-type patients without conjunctivitis.\n"," The authors concleded that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis. However, the possibility of virus particles in tear and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients without conjunctivitis cannot be completely ruled out.\n"," Marvi Cheema [11] and others reported a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with an initial medical presentation of keratoconjunctivitis, the first such reported case in North America.

Anterior segment examination of the affected eye was remarkable for 2+ conjunctival injection, 3+ follicles, 1 small pseudodendrite in the inferior temporal cornea, and 8 small (0.2 mm) subepithelial infiltrates with overlying epithelial defects at the superior temporal limbus. She was diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis and a conjunctival swab of the affected eye was positive for the SAR-CoV-2 virus.\n"," Lu Chen and colleagues [12] had describe the ocular manifestations of a hospitalised patient with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus disease. Thirteen days afer illness onset, the 30 years old reported redness, foreign body sensation and tearing in both eyes without blurred vision. Slit lamp examination identified bilateral moderate conjunctival injection, watery discharge, inferior palpebral conjunctival follicles and tender palpable preauricular lymph nodes. No subconjunctival haemorrhage or pseudomembrane were observed. No lesions on the corneal or anterior chamber inflammation were detected.\n"," He was diagnosed as bilateral acute conjunctivitis and RT-PCR assay demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in conjunctival specimen. The conjunctival swab specimens remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 14 and 17 days after onset. On day 19, RT-PCR result was negative for SARS-CoV-2.\n"," They concluded that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing ocular complications such as viral conjunctivitis in the middle phase of illness. However, conjunctival sampling might not be useful for early diagnosis because the virus may not appear initially in the conjunctiva.\n"," Zhang et al. [13] found that two patients with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 was found in ocular discharges by RT-PCR only in one COVID-19 patient. Although the incidence of conjunctivitis is extremely low, these results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 have shown a capacity to use the eye as a portal of entry and cause ocular disease. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 via the host functional receptor is mediated by ACE2 which is expressed in human cornea and conjunctival tissues.\n"," They concluded that the negative results of conjunctival sac in other 71 patients may be owing to the lower viral concentration, the sampling time lag (mean time 18.15 days), and the lower positive rate of the inefficient diagnostic method.\n"," Ziad and collegue [14] found that tracheal aspirates yelded significantly higher SARS-CoV loads, compared with the nasopharyngeal swab and sputum specimens. This suggests that the viral concentration and genome fraction is diverse in different sites. In consideration of the ocular surface is an open microenvironment, and the viral may transport to the inferior meatus of the nose rapidly, the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in ocular surface is likely to be very low.\n"," De Wit et collegues [15] demonstrated that, in the rhesus macaque model, MERS-CoV RNA could detect in the conjunctiva, and the viral loads could no longer be detected in the conjunctiva 6 days post infection.\n"," Another thing needs to be considered is that the lower positiive rate of RT-PCR makes early of SARS-CoV-2 a challenge. Therefore, improvements in the sensitivity of molecular diagnostic methods need to be taking in the future.\n"," A PubMed search on 24th March 2020 found no evidence that contact lens wearers are more likely to contract COVID-19 than spectacle wearers. The likely belief for this being a concern relates to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated in tears, albeit to date, infrequently [16] and also that the virus is known to be transferred by hand contact, and could be transferred to contact lenses during their application and removal. Thus, it is understandable this has been raised as a potential concern for increasing their risk of exposure to the virus. The consistent advice to protect individuals from the virus is to employ frequent handwashing with soap and water. The lipid envelope of the virus can be emulsified by surfactants such as those found in simple soap, which kills the virus [17, 18] .Best practice advice for contact lens wearers includes the same instructions that should be impered under all situations, regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic. When using contact lenses, careful and washing with soap ant water followed by hand drying with unused paper towels is paramount. For contact wearers, this should occur before every contact lens application and removal, and such practice reduces the risks of infection and inflammatory responses and is highly effective [19] . It follows that as long as contact lens wearers are using correct hand hygiene techniques, they should be limiting any virus transmission to their ocular surface, and indeed, as already stated, there is currently no evidence that they are at any higher risk of developing COVID-19 infection than non-wearers [20] .\n"," To date, there have been no laboratory studies reported on the ability of coronaviruses to adhere to contact lenses, and none on the ability of disinfectants to kill coronaviruses adhered to contact lenses [20] .\n"," There is no evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tears or conjunctival tissue of asymptomatic patients and even in those with confirmed disease, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface is low [16, 21, 22] . Thus, binding of SARS-CoV-2 to contact lenses from the ocular surface in asymptomatic wearers would be unlikely [20] .\n"," A recent paper [23] has been cited as suggesting that silicone hydrogels are more likely to bind SARS-CoV-2 than hydrogels. However, this paper did not examine contact lens materials [20] . The inanimate surfaces described in the paper [23] which most closely resemble contact lens materials were \"plastic\" and silicon rubber. Neither of these materials appropriately represents the complex bulk and surface chemistry of contemporary contact lens materials and cannot be used to reflect the likely binding of any pathogenetic organism to modern day contact lenses [20] . The factors governing the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to inanimate surfaces are so far unknown, but for a variety of waterborne viruses the major driving factors were electrostatic interactions (charge driven), followed by hydrophobic interactions, with only minor impact from van der Waals interactions [20] .\n"," The purpose of this review is to highlight the possible ocular presentation of COVID-19 infection and the consequence of the pandemic in the daily ophtalmology routine.\n"," Conjunctivitis (and keratoconjunctivitis) can be the first symptom in infected patients. The virus can be present in tear and conjuntival secretions, requiring maximum attention.\n"," It's important to understand if COVID-19 could spread through the ocular route or present as the primary infected site.\n"," Ocular implications should also be considered for therapy. In fact, one potential treatment is chloroquine and its derivatives [24, 25] , including hydroxychloroquine, which have both antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. These compounds are effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, but in vivo data are lacking. Although some encouraging outcomes have been reported, further evidence from coordinated multicentre trials is required.\n"," Hydroxychloroquine can induced Retinal Toxicity [26] after long term usage. Retinopathy is rarely seen before 10 or more years of usage at the recommended dosage [27] . However, the doses proposed to treat COVID-19 are 4-5 times higher [28] and this must be considered during the therapy and the ocular implication must be investigated. It's important to analays the ocular fundus before, during and after the treatment. The exponential increase in the number of Covid-19 cases was like a tsunami for health care companies, which were not ready to face this emergency. Ophthalmology departments were also affected by the reorganization of healthcare services. We submitted a questionnaire to 14 health care companies present in Piedmont, in Italy.\n"," In all there was a reduction in ambulatory activity, reserved only for urgent non-deferrable services. There was a reduction in shifts in the operating room, reserved for emergencies. In five cases, operating rooms were intended for COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms, sending urgent ophtalmology patients to other better equipped hospitals. Furthermore, in six hospitals, ophthalmology personnel were sent to the COVID-19 departments to carry out non-specialist assistance activities.\n"," A dedicated Covid-free ophthalmology department has been maintained in only four healthcare companies. In other cases, beds with other specialties have been merged, with the aim of freeing up as many hospital wards as possible for patients with COVID-19.\n"," Even when the emergency is over, the guard cannot be lowered. In fact, ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals remain at higher risk of infection, due to the proximity to the patients during the physical examination.\n"," It is important to think carefully about how to take care of patients until the World is declared COVID-free.\n"," Several infection control measures are recommended (Fig. 1) , subdivided into three categories [29] :\n"," use of PPE environmental control administrative control.\n"," In addition, the use of telemedicine must be encouraged to provide care for non-urgent cases. Telemedicine is defined as the use of information technologies to support healthcare between participants who are separated from each other [30] . Fortunately, the current technologies allow an optimal management for less severe cases. \"Routine post-op\" care for cataract surgery in nonglaucomatous eyes, for example, could likely be cut further via telemedicine.\n"," The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) [31] has published a report advising ophthalmologists to wear masks and eye protection when caring for patients potentially infected with COVID-19. In our opinion, it's important to use of PPE for all cases regardless of SARS status, as well as hand hygiene measures and use of gloves, N95 masks, goggles and gowns. The patient should not speaking during the slit lamp examination.\n"," The installation of large plastic protective screens on slit lamps (Fig. 2) is essential to minimize the risk of droplet contamination between the patient and ophthalmologist. Even AAO [31] recommended this installation.\n"," It's important the use of disinfectants specific to COVID-19 [32] , including diluted household bleach (five tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water) and alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol.\n"," Lai et al. [29] reported the importance of air ventilation in waiting areas.\n"," Basic survey to identify patients with possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or the development of COVID-19 should be performed.\n"," This should include questions about symptoms (fever, dry cough, sore throat, headache, loss of taste/smell) and proximity to a validated or suspected COVID-19 case as well as travel to an endemic region [31] . This screening should be performed by calling the patient in advance; in alternative, at the front desk once the patient arrives at the clinic.\n"," Balancing between the need to provide care and save sight and the risk of contracting COVID-19 should be considered with respect to each patient.\n"," In addition, social distancing must be implemented in waiting areas by blocking alternating seats (Fig. 3) .\n"," Further precautions can be taken during the visit [33] :\n"," the patient should enter without accompanying adults, if possible; Imaging devices will necessitate careful cleaning between patients. Automated perimetry needs to be completely revisited, since the perimetry bowl is not only a potential source of viral spread, but also notoriously difficult to clean without damage; use of disposable tonometers with single-use protective sleeves. Pneumotonometers and air-puff tonometry, both of which can presumably aerosolize the tear film and viral particles, may need to be avoided; \n"," It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the ocular manifestations of COVID-19.\n"," The studies analaysed, in fact, have some limitations. First, the sample size and the covered population consisted mainly of patients with mild disease. Moreover, the studies are often descriptive study, without a correlation analysis. Finally, no normal population was observed in the studies, so a normal control group should be included for comparison in future studies.\n"," Anyway, with the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and with it's high infectivity, it is necessary to rearrange ophthalmologist routine clinical practice in order to control viral spread and try to maximize patient and health-care provider's safety.\n"," It is essential to create COVID-free ophthalmology ward and a ward for suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Individuals with non-urgent ophthalmic problems who are suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases can be postoponed for medical treatment.\n"," If the visit is urgent, they must be evaluated in a designated isolated clinic.\n"," In the long run, it is helpful to capitalize on this experience and reorganize how we offer healthcare to our patients.

The persistence of dried viruses is affected by various environmental conditions and factors such as heat, moisture, pH, and the type of surface (12, 15) . Furthermore, the compositions of media may also influence the persistence of viruses. The impact of drying on viral persistence has been evaluated in previous studies using viruses typically prepared in standardized media, including a cell culture medium supplemented or not with fetal calf serum (FCS) (4, 19) . However, these media are not representative of clinical situations because viruses have been detected in protein-rich media, such as serum, and protein-poor media, including water (11, 17) .\n"," In the present study, the persistence of two enveloped viruses, influenza virus type A (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and two non-enveloped viruses, minute mouse virus (MVM) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), was investigated. These viruses are relevant models for assessing viral persistence. MVM is a member of the Parvoviridae family, which is known to be resistant to desiccation (9) , and the other viruses have been implicated in nosocomial infections (5) . Furthermore, infectious titers higher than 10 6 TCID 50 mL −1 can be obtained for each virus in vitro.\n"," In addition, components of virus-containing media may affect viral persistence. Therefore, the influence of concentrations of common media components (fetal bovine serum [FCS] , bovine serum albumin [BSA] and sodium chloride [NaCl]) on the persistence of CVB4 was also investigated.\n"," CVB4 E2 is a strain provided by Ji-Won Yoon (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) (8, 13) . HSV-1 (ATCC VR-260), CVB4, MVM (ATCC VR-1346), and H1N1 A/PR/8/34 (ATCC VR-1469) were propagated on Vero (ATCC CCL-81) cells, Hep-2 (ATCC CCL-23) cells, A9 (EACC N° 85011426) cells, and MDCK (NBL2) (ATCC CCL-34) cells, respectively. Infected A9 cells cultured in supplemented DMEM and supplemented MEM (Invitrogen, France) were used to culture Vero and Hep-2 cells. MEM and DMEM media were supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% L-glutamine at 37°C and incubated in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Infected MDCK cells were cultured in MEM at 35°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. When cell lysis reached at least 75%, the inoculated flasks were scratched, freeze-thawed three times, and centrifuged at 2,000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was aseptically aliquoted and stored in a −80°C freezer. The viral titer was determined by limiting a dilution assay to 50% of the tissue culture infection dose by the method of Spearman-Kärber method and expressed as log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (7) .\n"," CVB4E2-positive strand RNA was quantitated by two-step quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (15) . Briefly, total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, California). Total RNA was retro-transcribed to cDNA using the Affinityscript QPCR cDNA synthesis kit and a specific reverse primer at 42°C for 15 min. Positive strand-specific RT was quantitated by the brilliant II QPCR kit (Agilent Technologies Stratagene) under universal cycle conditions (10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 60°C) on a Mx3000p (Stratagene). Primers were located within the enterovirus 5'-nontranslated region, which was highly conserved among enterovirus serotypes: CVB4 forward (5'-CCCTGAAT GGGGCTAATC) and CVB4 reverse (5'-ATTGTCACCATA AGCAGCCA). The sequence of the CVB4 probe was 5'-VIC-AACCGACTACTTTGGGTGTCCGTGTTT-TAMRA (Applied Biosystems). Negative controls were performed by RT-PCR without the reverse transcriptase enzyme or without DNA. Primers and probe pairs were designed with PrimerExpress software, and data were analyzed with Sequence Detector version 1.6.3 (both from Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts). Results were expressed as the cycle threshold (Ct)\n"," Fifty microliters (10 µL for iterative drying) of the virus inocula were applied to the middle of each petri dish lid (35-mm diameter [Falcon]), and dried under the air flow of a class II biological safety cabinet at room temperature. The air flow speed was 0.4 m s −1 and the relative humidity was measured using a relative humidity meter (Temperature and Humidity Data logger, IHM). Medium (1 mL) was added to recover dried virus inocula. The infectious titers of harvested fluids were then determined and the results expressed as described above.\n"," Statistical analyses of the results were performed by the Mann-Whitney U test using Graphpad Prism version 5.00 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, USA) when appropriate. Differences were considered to be significant when P <0.05.\n"," Fifty microliters of clarified culture supernatant fluids from cells infected with CVB4, MVM, H1N1, or HSV-1 were applied to petri dish lid surfaces and then dried under the airflow of a class II biological safety cabinet at room temperature (20 ± 2°C). The dried inocula were recovered and titrations were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section.\n"," Samples were considered dried when liquid was no longer observed on the lids, which occurred within 2 h. The mean values of the infectious titers of droplets containing HSV-1, H1N1, and CVB4 were reduced by 2.33 log 10 ; 1.1 log 10 ; 1.5 log 10 , respectively, 2 h after the inoculation (Fig. 1 ). Infectious viruses were not detected in dried HSV 1 and H1N1 inocula recovered 3 and 5 d after inoculation. In contrast, the viral titers in dried CVB4 inocula recovered 2 h to 5 d post inoculation were unchanged (4.39 +/− 0.38 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 , n=4). The viral titer of MVM in dried inocula recovered one week post inoculation was unchanged and similar to the titers measured in drops applied to the lids (5.87 +/− 0.20 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 n=4). No infectious particle was detected in dried CVB4 inocula 6 weeks after inoculation, whereas a significant amount of infectious particles was recovered from dried MVM inocula (0.5 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 [detection limit] vs 4.00 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 , respectively, P <0.02).\n"," Reductions in the infectious titers in recovered inocula when drops were dried on petri dish lids raised several issues. The efficiency of recovering viral particles in these conditions was questioned. The infectious titer of CVB4 was determined to address this issue, and RNA was also extracted to measure the amount of viral RNA by RT real-time PCR in order to estimate the level of viral particles. The amounts of viral RNA in recovered inocula dried for 2 h at room temperature and in fresh inocula were similar, as displayed by the pattern of Ct values obtained by RT real-time PCR (mean values were 24.36 vs. 23.86, respectively, P=0.56), whereas the infectious titer values were markedly different (2.17 log 10 reduction P=0.028) (Fig. 2) . Taken together, these results demonstrated that viral particles dried on petri dish lids were readily recovered.\n"," Thus, after drying on a plastic surface, the non-enveloped viruses, CVB4 and MVM, remained infectious for a longer period of time than the enveloped viruses, H1N1 and HSV-1.\n"," The patterns of resistance of MVM, CVB4, H1N1, and HSV-1 were examined. Ten microliters of each clarified supernatant fluid containing MVM, CVB4, H1N1, and HSV-1 was dried as described above. Repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension were carried out: 10 µL of sterile distilled water was added to a dried spot to start a new cycle of drying. Thereafter, dried inocula were recovered using 1 mL of culture medium and the viral titers were determined. Fifty microliters of each culture supernatant fluid containing H1N1, CVB4, HSV-1, or MVM was applied to Petri dish lids in quadruplicate. They were dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet at room temperature from 2 h to 6 weeks. Thereafter, dried inocula were recovered using 1 mL of titer media and the infectious titers were determined and expressed as log 10 . The results are the mean ± SD of four independent experiments. The dashed line represents the detection limit of the test. Each drying cycle resulted in a gradual reduction in the viral titers of H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 of approximately −0.4, −1.1, and −1.8 log 10 TCID 50 10 µL −1 per cycle, respectively (Fig. 3) . No reduction in the viral titer was detected for MVM after each cycle of drying. Furthermore, a reduction in viral titers was not observed in clarified supernatant fluids containing viruses kept at room temperature for the duration of the experiment (data not shown).\n"," These results showed that iterative drying resulted in reductions in the viral titers of H1N1, CVB4, and HSV-1, whereas those of MVM remained unchanged.\n"," Media containing various concentrations of FCS, BSA, and NaCl diluted in distilled sterile water were spiked with 1% of clarified CVB4-containing supernatants. Fifty microliters of these viral suspensions were applied to petri dish lids and dried, and viral titers in the recovered dried spots 2 h after the inoculation were determined.\n"," When the CVB4 suspension was spiked in medium containing a low concentration of FCS (<0.05%) or BSA (<0.01 mg mL −1 ) (Fig. 4) , the viral titers in the recovered dried spots were higher at 2.66 and 3.08 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 , respectively. In contrast, the viral titers in the suspension containing 1.25% of FCS and more than 0.39 mg mL −1 of BSA were below the detection limit of the test <0.5 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 . The viral titers in the suspension containing more than 1.25% FCS increased steadily and reached 1.17 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 at 100% FCS (P=0.019 vs the detection limit of the test).\n"," The viral titers in the recovered dried spots were lower when CVB4 was spiked in FCS and BSA media than in media containing any concentration of NaCl (Fig. 4) .

In contrast, the viral titers in media containing between 0.1 and 2 mg mL −1 NaCl decreased from 3.08 to 2.58 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (P=0.04). In media containing more than 2 mg mL −1 NaCl, the viral titers increased steadily and reached 4.16 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 at 300 mg mL −1 NaCl (P=0.028 vs. viral titers at 2 mg mL −1 NaCl).\n"," The efficiency of recovering CVB4 when drops were dried in protein-rich media was analyzed. Viral titers were determined and RNA was extracted to measure the amount of viral RNA by RT real-time PCR. Experiments were performed with CVB4 spiked (1% vol/vol final dilution) in FBS (100%) or water containing 50 mg mL −1 BSA. In both protein-rich media, the amounts of viral RNA in recovered inocula dried for 2 h at room temperature and in undried inocula were similar, as displayed by the pattern of Ct values obtained by RT real-time PCR, whereas the infectious titer values were markedly different (Fig. 5) . Taken together, these results demonstrated that viral particles contained in a protein-rich medium dried on petri dish lids were readily recovered.\n"," Several considerations in the present study are noteworthy. The persistence of H1N1, HSV-1, MVM, and CVB4 was investigated and, for the first time, the effects of NaCl, FCS and BSA concentrations on CVB4 persistence were determined. Moreover, the effects of repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension on the persistence of H1N1, HSV-1, MVM and CVB4 were investigated. We selected petri dish lids for two reasons: they are hydrophobic, which prevents spreading of the droplet, and are non-porous, thereby improving virus viability (2) . The efficiency of viral recovery from petri dish lids was confirmed in experiments combining the measurement of infectious titers and estimation of the levels of viral particles through the amount of viral RNA measured by RT real-time PCR.\n"," Inactivation under the biosafety cabinet was achieved at different times based on the type of virus being tested. Inactivation curves for H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 encompassed two phases. The first phase lasted 2 h and corres-ponded to rapid decreases in the viral titer of −2.33, −1.1, and −1.5 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 for HSV-1, H1N1, and CVB4, respectively, but not MVM. In the second phase, the viral titers of each virus slowly decreased. Scheuplein and al. reported that the first phase was characterized by water loss due to the evaporation of free water from the surface (14) , which exposes viruses to a liquid-air interface, leading to virus inactivation (18) . Repeated drying followed by resuspension in water was carried out for the first time in the present study. Infectious titers of H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 decreased gradually at each cycle, whereas no significant change was observed in the MVM infectious titer. Within these cycles, each resuspension modified particle positions and allowed for the new exposure of viral particles to the liquid-air interface, which may explain the continuous reductions observed in viral titers with each cycle (14) . CVB4, which persisted for 5 weeks under the biosafety cabinet, was fully inactivated by 4 cycles of iterative drying, while H1N1 persisted for 5 d and remained infectious after 8 cycles. This difference can be explained by rehydration during the resuspension process, which markedly inactivated non-lipid viruses, as reported previously for poliovirus (3) . However, MVM, a non-enveloped virus, was not affected by iterative drying.\n"," Enveloped viruses were more sensitive than non-enveloped viruses in the second phase of viral persistence, which started when liquid was no longer observed on the lids; H1N1 and HSV-1 were inactivated in 5 d and 3 d, whereas CVB4 was inactivated in 6 weeks and MVM continued to be infectious. Drying was slower in this phase, which can be explained by the slow process of water loss due to the diffusion and elimination of bound water, as demonstrated previously (14) . It remains to be determined whether the process is still slower in the case of MVM, as reflected by the persistence of this virus in our experiments.\n"," A discrepancy was noted between our results and previous findings and was explained by several differences regarding media, surfaces, virus strains and temperature. Bean et al. inactivated H1N1 at a higher temperature (28.3°C vs. 20°C) (2) and Abad et al. inactivated poliovirus, an enterovirus resuspended in PBS, on a latex surface in less than 20 d (1) whereas CVB4 was inactivated in 6 weeks in our experiments.\n"," The results of our study show that the initial concentrations of BSA, FCS, and NaCl played a role in the pattern of viabil- , and 50 µL of these suspensions were applied to petri dish lids in quadruplicate. Inocula on lids were dried for 2 h at room temperature, and, thereafter, recovered with 1 mL of culture media. The infectious titers were determined and expressed as log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (■). RNA was extracted and the levels of viral RNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and expressed as C t (□). The results are the mean + SD of four independent experiments. The dashed line represents the detection limit.\n"," ity of CVB4 exposed to drying. The infectious titers of CVB4 after drying were higher when the virus was in pure water than in water containing BSA or FCS. These results demonstrated that the resistance of CVB4 to drying was hampered in the presence of BSA or FCS. The survival curves of CVB4 resuspended in 0 to 0.29 mg mL −1 BSA in 0 and 1.25% FCS were similar, which is consistent with the corresponding concentration of BSA in FCS under these conditions (0 and 0.30 mg mL −1 ). Taken together, these results suggest that the lower resistance of CVB4 in the presence of 0 to 1.25% FCS in our experiments depended on albumin. In contrast, with an initial concentration of more than 1.25% FCS, the impact of drying on CVB4 viability was reduced. A previous study reported that higher concentrations of proteins protected viruses against drying (16) ; however, CVB4 exposed to drying was fully inactivated in the presence of high concentrations of BSA (more than 0.39 mg mL −1 ) in the present study. The mechanism underlying the protective effect provided by high concentrations of FCS against drying remains to be determined. At an initial concentration of more than 10 mg L −1 , NaCl protected CVB4 from desiccation. This can be explained by a slow rehydration process during sample recovery, which protected the viral capsid, as previously suggested (3). In contrast, the viability of CVB4 was the lowest at a concentration of 9 mg mL −1 NaCl, which is the average concentration in blood.\n"," We herein showed that viruses persisted for days or even weeks on dry hydrophobic surfaces. The pattern of resistance of viruses toward drying, as illustrated in the model of CVB4, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral populations, as suggested by the results of iterative drying. Moreover, media compositions and component concentrations clearly played a role when virus suspensions were exposed to drying. The results of our study suggest that a subsequent increase in solute concentrations in droplets modulated the viability of viruses toward drying. Since the compositions of media play a role in the viability of viruses exposed to drying, the persistence of viruses in natural media (clinical or environmental), instead of defined media, need to be investigated. Further studies will be directed towards this line of investigation in our laboratory.\n","Score: 7.208980993484255\n","\n","Title: Biocide-tolerance and antibiotic-resistance in community environments and risk of direct transfers to humans: Unintended consequences of community-wide surface disinfecting during COVID-19? *\n","Body Text: Since the first reported outbreak in December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused over 100 million confirmed infections, including more than two million deaths around the globe . Contact with viruscontaminated surfaces, or fomites, has been recognized as an effective route of community spread of the novel coronavirus (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2020a) . As vaccine doses are being administered to the wider population (Dai et al., 2020; , infection control and prevention strategies remain in place in most countries. One effective measure to contain the virus spread is to use disinfectants to destroy viral pathogens that are present on common touch surfaces. Public guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend regular cleaning and disinfecting on high touch surfaces in homes and public places by spraying and wiping with disinfectants (CDC, 2021; WHO, 2020b) . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency publishes a list of approved disinfectant products for containment of COVID-19 with regular updates (EPA, 2021) . Of the 535 products listed, the most commonly used active ingredients are quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs, a group of chemically similar substances), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), and ethyl alcohol (ethanol) (EPA, 2021) . In total, the four biocidal agents represent two-thirds of the active ingredients used in current EPA-approved disinfectant products for Global sales of surface disinfectants totaled $4.5 billion in 2020, representing a dramatic increase (>30%) over the previous year (Lewis, 2021) . The intensive and indiscriminate use of chemical disinfectants raised concerns on their potential adverse ecological effects. In a recent discussion, Nabi et al. (2020) pointed out that the massive use of toxic and corrosive disinfectants in outdoor urban environments threatened urban wildlife. Zhang et al. (2020) argued that some disinfectants would end up in aquatic environments and pose acute risks to aquatic biota. Similar views were held by Chu et al. (2020) that the overuse of chlorine-based disinfectants could impair water quality and threaten ecology and human health. Singh (2020) further postulated that the injudicious use of disinfectants and sanitizers could accelerate the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in natural environments, after their eventual discharge or disposal.\n"," Concerning antimicrobial resistance, much of the discussion in recent literature has revolved around the prevalent use and sometimes misuse of antibiotics in the current pandemic (Anonymous, 2020; Bengoechea and Bamford, 2020; Hsu, 2020; Reardon, 2020) . Given the fact that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 are often prescribed with antibiotics for treating bacterial coinfections, some warned that excessive use of antibiotics e sometimes even on patients showing no symptom of bacterial infection e can exacerbate the emergence of antibiotic resistance (Anonymous, 2020; Bengoechea and Bamford, 2020; Clancy and Nguyen, 2020; Hsu, 2020; Usman et al., 2020; Yam, 2020) . A widely overlooked risk, however, lies in the fact that massive loads of chemical disinfectants are being used on a routine basis in community settings, including many public places with high user occupancy or foot traffic, to reduce the virus spread or as a precautionary measure. In areas with persisting spread of COVID-19, such practices have been put in place for months with no ending yet in sight (CDC, 2021) . In this context, antimicrobial resistance emerged from regularly disinfected surfaces and environments in those immediate surroundings may become a realistic risk which has been barely addressed in current regulatory guidelines or scholarly discussions revolving around COVID-19. In this domain, the limited information published to date predominantly focuses on the discharges (e.g., via runoffs) of chemical disinfectants and the induction of antimicrobial resistance in the receiving environments, such as in municipal wastewater, surface water, and soils (Hora et al., 2020; Murray, 2020; Usman et al., 2020) . In reality, community-related environments have much closer links with humans, where antimicrobial resistant pathogens emerged under current circumstances could pose risks of direct transfers to humans via contacting surfaces, touching objects, or similar activities. Such risks are not of a speculative nature: ample evidence showed that when exposed to those commonly used biocidal agents, many types of bacterial pathogens could develop increased tolerance and through similar mechanisms, acquire resistance to antibiotics (Russell, 1999) . In July 2020, a group of scientists at WHO proposed that the short-and long-term impact of the widespread use of biocides for environmental and personal disinfection, including resistance to antimicrobials, should be included in the current research agenda (Getahun et al., 2020) .\n"," The use of chemical agents can radically change the microenvironment the bacteria living in. By exerting constant selective pressures, biocidal agents promote bacterial tolerance over time, especially on those high touch surfaces in public settings where cleaning and disinfecting are routinely performed under the current regulatory guidelines (CDC, 2021; Mc Carlie et al., 2020; WHO, 2020b) . Along with their intensive and regular uses during COVID-19, such risks may culminate to unprecedented levels and persist as the current pandemic continues. The frequent and complex interactions between people and their immediate surroundings mean that antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogens emerged in these settings could pose direct risks to humans, especially in densely populated urban communities.\n"," As the current pandemic passes over the twelve-month mark since the first report to the WHO, and the spread of the virus and new variants continue with the slow vaccine rollouts, fresh concerns have been raised over the widespread and regular use of chemical disinfectants in public spaces and community environments. On January 29, 2021, Nature published a feature article where the author combed through existing evidence on fomite transmission of COVID-19 and raised questions over the cleaning and disinfection protocols that have been widely put in place in response to COVID-19 (Lewis, 2021) . On the same day, two Australian scientists published a letter in Science expressing concerns over the surging use of antimicrobials including disinfectants, sanitizers, and antiseptics during COVID-19, and warned on the potential of disinfectant-facilitated bacterial acquisition of antimicrobial resistance, a widely acknowledged environmental and public health risk (Lu and Guo, 2021) . Building on the recent scholarly discussions (Hora et al., 2020; Murray, 2020; Nabi et al., 2020; Usman et al., 2020) , this article aims to present the first comprehensive view on this issue in the current literature context, by focusing on the main biocidal active compounds in disinfectant products approved for COVID-19. To this end, we surveyed the active ingredients in disinfectant products currently approved for COVID-19 and the common mechanisms promoting tolerance to biocides in bacteria and resistance to certain antibiotics. By scrutinizing the up-to-date evidence and scholarly discussions, we highlight the risks of exacerbated emergence of biocide-tolerant and drug-resistant bacteria by current practices of regular community-wide chemical disinfecting as well as potential transfers of antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogens to humans. We also propose feasible strategies to mitigate these risks in the current pandemic and possibly in the post-pandemic era, as such practices may continue as a precautionary measure before the eradication of COVID-19.\n"," As of March 3, 2021, there are 535 EPA-approved chemical disinfectant products for COVID-19 disinfection (EPA, 2021) . Despite the large varieties of products offered to consumers, the majority of these products rely on several biocidal active compounds (i.e., biocidal agents) as active ingredients for COVID-19 disinfection. Of those, the most commonly used biocidal agents are a group of structurally similar quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), and ethyl alcohol (ethanol). Altogether, the four groups of biocidal agents account for two-thirds of the active ingredients found in current EPA-approved disinfectants (Fig. 1) . Nearly 81% of the disinfectant products (n ¼ 431) use only one biocidal agent, while the rest of them use two (n ¼ 90) or more (n ¼ 14) in their formulation.\n"," The lack of diversity of active ingredients used in these products increases the likelihood of exposing bacteria to the same type of biocidal agents over and over again on a regular basis, under the current practices of regular disinfecting of contact surfaces in community and public settings during COVID-19. QACs, which constitute the highest percentage of biocidal agents in EPAapproved disinfectant products for COVID-19 disinfection, contain a variety of structurally similar compounds. For instance, benzalkyl dimethylammonium compounds (BACs), the most widely used active ingredients in EPA-approved QAC disinfectant products, are benzalkyl dimethyl ammonium compounds (i.e., first-generation QACs) or ethylbenzalkyl dimethyl ammonium compounds (i.e., second-generation QACs) or a combination of both (i.e., thirdgeneration QACs). Dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (DAD-MACs) are predominantly dioctyl, octyl decyl, or didecyl dimethylammonium chloride or a combination of these, which are often considered as the fourth-generation QACs. Among the 247 QACs products currently approved for COVID-19 disinfection (as of March 3, 2021), 117 products contained only BACs, 19 contained only DADMACs, 111 contained both BACs and DADMACs, and 49 contained QACs with other non-QAC active ingredients such as ethanol or isopropanol (Fig. 1) . The fourth-generation QACs (twin or dualchain QACs) generally have superior antimicrobial performance than the former generations (Gerba, 2015) . However, the antimicrobial effects of different QACs are similar, e.g., adsorption and penetration of cell wall, reaction with cell membrane, degradation of proteins and nuclei acids, leakage of cellular content, which involve the positive charged quaternary nitrogen and N-alkyl chain (Buffet-Bataillon et al., 2012b; Gerba, 2015) . As a result, bacteria could develop similar mechanisms to increase tolerance to different QACs. In general, if a microorganism is intrinsically tolerant to certain QACs or acquires such tolerance after exposure, it is likely to exhibit cross-tolerance to other QACs (Soumet et al., 2012; Tabata et al., 2003; Voumard et al., 2020) .\n"," It should be pointed out that even before the current pandemic, numerous studies had reported the occurrence of biocide-tolerant bacteria in food processing (Langsrud et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2016) , livestock and poultry farm (Bjorland et al., 2005; Long et al., 2016) , healthcare (Gebel et al., 2002; Pidot et al., 2018) , and domestic environments (Cooper et al., 2008) . Many types of bacterial pathogens have shown the ability to adapt and develop increased tolerance to biocidal agents, including the four major active ingredients used in products listed by EPA for COVID-19. For instance, He et al. (2014) isolated bacteria samples from their local community environments, and found that 24% of the isolates (n ¼ 268) collected from surfaces frequently disinfected by BACcontaining sprays or wipes showed tolerance to BAC (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 3 mg/L). In a recent review, Kampf (2018) conducted a systematic literature search to assess the adaptive potential of bacteria on low-level BAC exposure. Most of the reviewed bacterial species (n ¼ 57) underwent a multi-fold increase in MIC after adaption. Among those, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium showed the highest MIC to BAC (3000 mg/L), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2500 mg/L), Enterobacter spp.\n"," (1500 mg/L), Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1000 mg/L), which could exceed the BAC concentrations in practice use (Kampf, 2018) . Chlorine-tolerant bacteria were often detected in drinking water or drinking water distribution systems. Five chlorine-tolerant bacteria, namely, Legionella, Sphingomonas, Mycobacterium, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas are most commonly reported in published literature (Luo et al., 2021) . Notably, Sphingomonas TS001, a chlorine-tolerant bacterium, could withstand 4 mg/ L sodium hypochlorite which showed only 5% reduction in viability after 240 min of exposure (Sun et al., 2013) . Similar findings were reported on increased alcohol tolerance in healthcare settings. Pidot et al. (2018) tested the alcohol tolerance of Enterococcus faecium collected from hospitals, where the Enterococcus faecium isolates collected after 2010 were found to be ten-fold more tolerant to alcohol than were older (pre-2004) isolates. The study established a contaminated surface transmission model to assess the clinical relevance and demonstrated that even after disinfection with 70% isopropanol, alcohol-tolerant Enterococcus faecium could transmit to mice and colonize in their guts. In a follow-up study, Gebel et al. (2019) pointed out that Pidot et al. applied 0.85 mL isopropanol to cover a 450-cm 2 surface and thus may lead to inadequate surface disinfection. The authors showed that 60% or 70% isopropanol were sufficiently effective to inactivate alcoholtolerant strain of Enterococcus faecium but 23% isopropanol was not. The study concluded that healthcare workers could be reassured that, when used at 60% or 70% (v/v) for the appropriate contact time and with a sufficient volume, isopropanol would be effective against Enterococcus faecium. Studies on hydrogen peroxide tolerance are relatively scant, although published data suggested that both group A Streptococcus and Escherichia coli could develop tolerance to it over a short period of exposure (Dukan and Touati, 1996; Henningham et al., 2015) . In addition, other researchers have observed increased bacterial tolerance to phenolic compounds, peroxyacetic acid, isopropanol, and hypochlorous acid (Horinouchi et al., 2017; Nguyen and Yuk, 2013; Nontaleerak et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2019) , all of which are used as common active ingredients in current EPA-approved disinfectant products for COVID-19 ( Fig. 1) .\n"," One of the difficulties in defining the adaptive behaviors of bacteria to biocidal agents is the terminology used in the existing literature. Currently, there is no clear and consensual definition of 'disinfectant resistance' and 'reduced susceptibility' or 'increased Active ingredients in EPA-approved disinfectants for COVID-19. As of March 3, 2021, a total of 535 products are listed, with 34 biocidal active compounds contained within. Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) were found in 247 products, hydrogen peroxide in 82 products, sodium hypochlorite in 74 products, and ethyl alcohol in 35 products. Other common active ingredients include peroxyacetic acid (30), phenolic (29), isopropanol (21), and hypochlorous acid (21). Most of these approved products contain only one active ingredient (n ¼ 431), and some products contain two (n ¼ 90) or more (n ¼ 14). A QAC product may contain one or several benzalkyl dimethyl ammonium compounds (BACs) and dialkyl dimethyl ammonium compounds (DADMACs), or a combination of both. Specifically, among the 247 QACs products approved, 117 contained only BACs, 19 contained only DADMACs, and 111 products contained both BACs and DADMACs. There are also 49 products containing QACs and other non-QAC biocidal active compound such as ethanol or isopropanol. All products are intended for use on surfaces (not humans). EPA expects them to kill the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) when used in accordance with their label directions. This list is regularly updated by the EPA (available at: https://cfpub.epa.gov/giwiz/ disinfectants/index.cfm).\n"," tolerance' in scholarly literature (Cerf et al., 2010; Chapman, 2003a; Langsrud et al., 2003; Maillard, 2018; Maillard et al., 2013; Russell, 1999) . A comprehensive definition was proposed earlier by Russell (1999) that bacteria which are (i) insusceptible to a concentration of disinfectant used in practice or (ii) not inactivated (or sometimes not inhibited) by a concentration that inactivates (or inhibits) the majority of strains of that organism are deemed to be in this category. Recently, some scholars argued that the concept of disinfectant resistance or tolerance should be clearer, namely, surviving bacteria after disinfection at recommended concentration should be termed as 'resistant' and bacteria with higher MIC should be termed as 'reduced susceptibility' or 'increased tolerance' (Cerf et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2019) . In this article, we adopted the definition by Weber et al. (2019) to avoid ambiguity on terminology.\n"," In general, the tolerance to biocidal agents in bacteria can be categorized as intrinsic and acquired. Intrinsic tolerance is a natural chromosomally controlled property which means that a bacterial species are less susceptible to certain biocides than other bacterial species and often manifests as a permeability barrier reducing the uptake of foreign substances (Ortega Morente et al., 2013; Russell, 1999; Sheldon, 2005) . Bacterial spores have been considered as the most biocide-tolerant bacterial species, followed by mycobacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 2) . The coat or possible cortex of spore, the cell wall of mycobacteria, and the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria can confer increased tolerance to biocides, while Gram-positive bacteria is most susceptible (Ortega Morente et al., 2013; Russell, 1999; Sheldon, 2005) . In addition, physiological (phenotypic) adaptions could confer intrinsic bacterial tolerance to biocides, and bacterial cells contained within a biofilm are more insusceptible to biocides than planktonic cells (Ortega Morente et al., 2013; Russell, 1999; Sheldon, 2005) . Acquired tolerance, which can be effectuated by cellular genetic alterations or acquisition of exogenous mobile genetic elements carrying biocide-tolerant genes, is observed in certain strains of bacteria that are less susceptible to some antimicrobials compared with the average for this bacterial species (Mc Carlie et al., 2020) . Specifically, genetic alterations such as mutations or differential gene expression can lead to increased tolerance under antimicrobial stress exerted by biocidal agents (Mc Carlie et al., 2020) . Meanwhile, horizontal gene transfers allow mobile genetic elements carrying biocide-tolerant genes, such as plasmids and integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), to move from the donor cell to the recipient cell (Partridge et al., 2018) (Fig. 3) .\n"," Bacterial mutations are random in nature but can also be driven by selective pressure exerted by antimicrobials (e.g., disinfectants), which could contribute to the development of increased tolerance (Maillard, 2018; Mc Carlie et al., 2020) . Kim et al. (2018a) described fixed mutations in the pmrB gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa after continuous culture in the presence of BAC, which reduced the negative charges in the outer membranes and resulted in its increased tolerance to BAC. Horinouchi et al. (2017) exposed Escherichia coli to isopropanol (0e500 mM, in 50 mM steps) for adaptive laboratory evolution. The authors found that mutations of relA, marC, proQ, yfgO, and rraA conferred tolerance to isopropanol and several other alcohols (e.g., ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol). Furi et al. (2013) reported that mutations in the promoter region of norA, a major facilitator super (MFS) family transporter, resulted in increased expression and conferred increased tolerance to benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine.\n"," Horizontal gene transfer is considered to be an important contributor in the development of increased biocide tolerance in bacteria (Mc Carlie et al., 2020) . Bacteria can acquire mobile genetic elements (MGEs) bearing biocide-tolerance genes from other bacteria. Among them, insertion sequences, transposons, integrons, and gene cassettes are able to move between DNA molecules within a cell, while ICEs and plasmids could move between bacteria (Fig. 3) . Insertion sequences (IS) are discrete DNA segments carrying more than one transposase (Tnp) genes. Two copies of the same or related insertion sequences could bind to both sides of a \"passenger\" gene to form a composite transposon (Tn) (Mc Carlie et al., 2020; Partridge et al., 2018) . Unit transposon is much different to composite transposon, which was bounded by a pair of inverted repeats (IR) rather than insertion sequences, carrying a transposase gene and \"passenger\" genes (Mc Carlie et al., 2020; Partridge et al., 2018) . Insertion sequences and transposon carrying \"passenger\" genes (e.g., biocide-tolerant genes) can randomly translocate to different locations on the same or other DNA molecules (Mc Carlie et al., 2020; Partridge et al., 2018) . Gene cassettes typically contain one promoter-less gene and an attC recombination site, which are captured by a lager genetic unit integron (Hall, 2012; Partridge et al., 2009 ). Integrons are defined as an attI recombination site, a promoter (Pc), and an intI gene which mediate the insertion and excision of gene cassettes (Hall, 2012) . Plasmids are circular or linear extrachromosomal replicons which can carry other mobile genetic elements to transfer between bacteria by conjugation (Shintani et al., 2015) . Also known as conjugative transposons, ICEs can integrate into host chromosome and replicate (Carraro and Burrus, 2015; Johnson and Grossman, 2015) . Intercellular gene transfers include conjugation/mobilization (mediated by plasmids and ICEs), transformation (uptake of naked extracellular DNA fragments), and transduction (bacteriophages transfer chromosomal DNA and MGEs) (Partridge et al., 2018; von Wintersdorff et al., 2016) . The acquisition and stockpiling of MGEs facilitate the rapid evolution of bacteria and accelerate the emergence of biocide tolerance (Mc Carlie et al., 2020) . Kim et al. (2018a) reported ICE-mediated BAC tolerance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which encoded efflux pumps to extrude the biocide molecule. In another study, Elhanafi et al. (2010) found that the BAC tolerance of Listeria monocytogenes H7550 was associated with a gene cassette harbored on the plasmid of the strain, pLM80, which included two efflux pump genes (bcrB and bcrC) and a transcriptional regulator (bcrA) that controls the transcription of multidrug efflux systems. Norman et al. (2008) reported that the plasmid pOLA52 in Escherichia coli was able to express multidrug efflux \n"," Efflux pump has been recognized as a major mechanism of biocide tolerance in many bacteria (Gnanadhas et al., 2013) . Referred to as multidrug resistant (MDR) proteins, these transmembrane proteins can pump out a wide range of toxic substances, including biocidal agents, from bacterial cells (Buffet-Bataillon et al., 2012b; Poole, 2007) . Five efflux pump families have been identified (Fig. 4) , namely, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, the major facilitator super (MFS) family, the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) family, the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family, and the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily (Buffet-Bataillon et al., 2012b; Ortega Morente et al., 2013; Putman et al., 2000) . Except for ABC family transporters which directly use ATP energy as the driving force, the other four transporter families are powered by the transmembrane H þ or Na þ gradient (Wand, 2017) . In Staphylococcus aureus, chromosomallyencoded biocide efflux pumps include the MepA protein (MATE) and the NorA, NorB, MdeA, LmrS proteins (MFS), while plasmidencoded biocide efflux pumps include the QacA, QacB proteins (MFS) and the Smr, QacG, QacH, QacJ proteins (SMR). Both the chromosomally-encoded and plasmid-encoded efflux pumps can confer tolerance to QACs in Staphylococcus aureus (Costa et al., 2013) . These MDR efflux pumps could also extrude other unrelated compounds, including dyes (rhodamine, ethidium bromide) and antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin) (Costa et al., 2013) . Enterococcus faecalis was found to express the biocide transporter QacA/B (MFS), in addition to QacED1 (SMR) and EfrAB (ABC) (Bischoff et al., 2012; Kazama et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2003) . Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the qacA/B (MFS) gene system has the most common QAC-tolerant genes, which are found on plasmids (Jennings et al., 2015) . The qacA and qacB genes are closely related with only seven nucleotides being different, resulting in changes in only one amino acid (Paulsen et al., 1996) . As a consequence, the QacA transporter utilizes acidic aspartic acid residue to confer tolerance to monovalent and divalent cations via proton motive force, while the QacB transporter with an uncharged residue (alanine) is more specifically tolerant to monovalent cations (Jennings et al., 2015; Ortega Morente et al., 2013; Paulsen et al., 1996) . Efflux pumps and their determinants of biocide tolerance are also widely distributed in Gram-negative bacteria (Poole, 2005) . The biocide transporters in Escherichia coli include the YdhE, MdtK, NorM efflux pump (MATE), the MdfA, CmlA, CmlB, Cmr efflux pump (MFS), the EmrE, SugE efflux pump (SMR), and the AcrAB-TolC, MdtABC-TolC, MdtEF-TolC, CusCFBA efflux pump (RND) (Anes et al., 2015; Buffet-Bataillon et al., 2012b; Poole, 2005; Slipski et al., 2018) . The presence of qacA (MFS), qacDE, qacE (SMR), and acrA (encode precursor for AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, RND) in Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae could accommodate common biocides including ethanol, chlorhexidine acetate, chlorine-containing '84' disinfectant, and benzalkonium bromide (Guo et al., 2015) . In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, QacED1, QacF, QacG (SMR) efflux pumps and PmpM (MATE) efflux pumps conferred tolerance to QACs, while MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, MexJK (RND) efflux pumps conferred tolerance to triclosan (Chuanchuen et al., 2002 (Chuanchuen et al., , 2005 Poole, 2005; Wand, 2017) . Recently, Kim et al. (2018a) showed that the increased expression of ICE-harbored efflux genes (i.e., sugE-A, sugE-B [SMR], ABC transporter related genes, and an RND family member gene) and chromosomally-harbored muxABC-opmB genes (RND) are related to BAC tolerance (alkyl (60% C 12 , 40% C 14 ) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride). In Acinetobacter Baumannii, biocide transporters included the AbeM efflux pump (MATE), the AdeF efflux pump (MFS), the AbeS efflux pumps (SMR), and the AdeABC, AdeIJK, AbuO efflux pumps (RND) (Wand, 2017) .\n"," The proteobacterial antimicrobial compound efflux (PACE) family, a new multidrug efflux pump family recently reported, was first discovered in Acinetobacter baumannii and hence named as Acinetobacter chlorhexidine efflux protein I (AceI) (Hassan et al., 2013 (Hassan et al., , 2015 . AceI transporter and its homologs widely existed in Gram-negative bacteria, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Acinetobacter baylyi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas protegens, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, which were shown to confer bacterial tolerance to chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride, dequalinium, proflavine, and acriflavine (Hassan et al., 2013 (Hassan et al., , 2015 .\n"," Membrane alteration, which includes variations in the composition and content of membrane proteins, fatty acids, and phospholipids, can confer bacterial tolerance to biocides (Maillard, 2018) . The porin loss of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli reduce their cell membrane permeability and consequently increase their tolerance to biocides (Coldham et al., 2010; Fernandez-Cuenca et al., 2015; Forbes et al., 2019; Karatzas et al., 2008) . Tabata et al. (2003) showed that OprR, an outer membrane protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was correlated with BAC tolerance. The authors observed an increase level of OprR expression in BAC-tolerant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and recovered BAC susceptibility in the corresponding knockout mutant. Some studies showed that QACs induced specific variations in the membrane fatty acid composition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Guerin- Mechin et al., 1999; Mechin et al., 1999) . With a hydrophobic long C-chain, the diffusion and penetration of QACs in cell are closely related to membrane lipids and lipopolysaccharides (Russell and Gould, 1988) . Therefore, changes in membrane fatty acid composition could limit the adsorption and penetration of QACs and thus cause a progressive loss of bactericidal efficacy. Kim et al. (2018a) found that the reduction of oprG gene expression decreased OprG, a major outer membrane protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa which mediates the diffusion of small hydrophobic molecules, and prevented the adsorption and penetration of BAC. The change of membrane potential could also result in decreased susceptibility to biocides in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Maillard, 2018) . In the study by Kim et al. (2018a) , reduced negative charges in the outer membranes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resulted in decreased sorption of positively charged BAC. When exposed to tetradecyltrimethylammonium (TDTMA), Pseudomonas putida exhibited a higher membrane negative charge due to increased phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylglycerol contents (Boeris et al., 2007) . These phospholipids are the composition of released outer membrane vesicles and thus eliminate QACs molecules attached to the membrane by neutralizing the positive charges of ammonium quaternary moiety (Boeris et al., 2007; Marisa Heredia et al., 2016) .\n"," Biofilms can colonize virtually any biological or inanimate surface and have been identified in industrial, medical, and domestic settings (Hu et al., 2015; Kumar and Anand, 1998; Ledwoch et al., 2018; Rayner et al., 2004) . It is established that bacteria within biofilms can endure higher concentration of biocides compared to the same bacteria growing planktonically in suspensions (Cooper and Hanlon, 2010; Kumar and Anand, 1998; Shen et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2010) . Smith and Hunter (2008) grew biofilms of two nosocomial pathogens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, on hospital environmentrelevant materials and treated them with three hospital disinfectants, namely, BAC (1%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), and triclosan (1%). The results showed that these biocides were not effective to kill the bacteria within biofilms when used at their recommended concentrations. After the treatment, 0%e11% and 80% of viable cells were found in MRSA biofilms and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, respectively. For all three disinfectants, the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of both organisms living in biofilms were found to be 10e1000 times higher than their planktonic counterparts (Smith and Hunter, 2008) .\n"," Biofilms can confer bacterial tolerance to disinfectants through a multitude of mechanisms including reduced diffusion, chemical interactions with biocidal active compounds, reduced growth rates, enhanced mutation and horizontal gene transfer (Bridier et al., 2011; Kumar and Anand, 1998) . A characteristic feature of biofilms is their three-dimensional spatial structures consisting of multiple layers of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (Fig. 5) , which can act as physical diffusion barriers, molecular sieves, adsorbents, and reactants to hamper biocide penetration and react with biocidal active compounds (Bridier et al., 2011; Kumar and Anand, 1998) , potentially resulting in exposure to sublethal concentrations of biocides (Chapman, 2003b) . Inside biofilms, competition for nutrients and limited access to oxygen result in slow growth and starving cells, which can also contribute to increased bacterial tolerance to biocides (Bridier et al., 2011; Ortega Morente et al., 2013) . The slowly growing strains of Mycobacterium avium showed higher chlorine tolerance compared with rapidly growing strains (Taylor et al., 2000) . Notably, starvation could stimulate the synthesis of glutathione and subsequently promote the chlorine tolerance of some bacteria (Saby et al., 1999) . One study found that starving Klebsiella pneumoniae required up to 200fold more chlorine to achieve same six-log number reductions compared with the well-fed cells (Stewart and Olson, 1992) . Apart from these effects, biofilms can also promote biocide tolerance in bacteria via mutations or horizontal gene transfer (Conibear et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2010) . Conibear et al. (2009) reported that Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells in biofilms exhibited at least 100-fold increase in mutation frequency compared to planktonic cultures. In an earlier study, Ehlers and Bouwer (1999) demonstrated that the physical proximity of bacteria within biofilms could facilitate horizontal gene transfers. The authors reported that the conjugation frequencies between different species of Pseudomonas were 1000e50,000 times higher in biofilms compared with planktonic conditions.\n"," Generally, it is unlikely for bacteria to develop tolerance to biocides by target alteration since most biocides have multiple target sites against bacteria. Production of specific enzymes to inactivate the biocide molecule is also uncommon in bacteria (Gilbert and McBain, 2003; Wand, 2017) . Nonetheless, there have been some reports in these domains. The most well-known target alteration is the mutations in fabI gene which can confer increased tolerance to triclosan (Heath et al., 1999) . In this particular case, the function mechanism of triclosan is to inhibit the activity of the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) and thus prevent fatty acid synthesis (Heath et al., 1998) . Mutations in fabI gene have been found in Escherichia coli (Heath et al., 1999) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Hoang and Schweizer, 1999) , Staphylococcus aureus (Heath et al., 2000) , Acinetobacter baumannii (Chen et al., 2009) , Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Lee et al., 2002) , and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Skovgaard et al., 2013) . Some bacteria are also found to inactivate biocide molecules at low concentrations by synthesizing specific enzymes. For instance, group A Streptococcus can synthesize enzymes such as NoxA and AphC oxidase to decompose hydrogen peroxide (Henningham et al., 2015) . The presence of superoxide dismutase enzyme and catalase enzyme in Escherichia coli increased its tolerance to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (Demple, 1996; Greenberg and Demple, 1989) . Inactivation of phenols, aldehydes and QACs have also been reported in bacteria (Kummerle et al., 1996; Meade et al., 2001; Nishihara et al., 2000) .\n"," Inappropriate use of antibiotics has been recognized as the main cause of antibiotic resistance found in bacteria (Chokshi et al., 2019; Fair and Tor, 2014; Levy and Marshall, 2004; Michael et al., 2014; Ventola, 2015) . Factors driving the increased drug resistance among pathogens principally acquired in healthcare settings include greater severity of illness in hospitalized patients, presence of more severely immunocompromised patients, increased introduction of resistant pathogens from the community, effective implementation of infection control and isolation practices and compliance, increased use of antimicrobial prophylaxis, increased use of empirical polymicrobial therapy, and a high rate of antimicrobial use per geographic area per unit time (Anonymous, 2021) . Meanwhile, factors driving the increased resistance among pathogens principally acquired in the community settings include frequent and often overuse of antibiotics by both providers and patients, widespread use of antibiotics in agriculture and animal production, patient noncompliance with antibiotic therapy, prolonged survival of persons with chronic diseases and altered host defenses, and lack of research on new antibiotics (Anonymous, 2021) . The main mechanisms conferring antibiotic resistance to bacteria include reducing the access to the target (e.g., via efflux pump and impermeability), inactivation of antibiotics, and re-programing of its target structure (Blair et al., 2015; Walsh, 2000) . In comparison, less attention has been drawn to the fact that exposure to disinfectants could also promote antibiotic resistance and give rise to multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria (Buffet-Bataillon et al., 2012b; Kim et al., 2018b; Wand, 2017) .\n"," A substantial body of published literature has described the linkage between the use of chemical disinfectants and the growth of antibiotic resistance in some bacteria (Elekhnawy et al., 2020; Gilbert and McBain, 2003; Ortega Morente et al., 2013; Russell, 2003; Wand, 2017) . Langsrud et al. (2004) observed crossresistance to BAC and antibiotics in Escherichia coli after being exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of BAC. Specifically, enhanced efflux pumps were found to be responsible for the sixfold higher BAC MIC and ten-fold higher chloramphenicol MIC. Mc Cay et al. (2010) reported that after continuous enrichment culturing, Pseudomonas aeruginosa became 12 times more tolerant to BAC while at the same time, its resistance to ciprofloxacin increased by a remarkable 265 times e the latter was ascribed to mutations in gyrA. Kim et al. (2018b) elucidated the underlying mechanisms and showed that biocide tolerance genes and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were located in the same mobile genetic elements, and the mutations in pmrB and the upregulation of efflux pump genes contributed to the antibiotic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa after being exposed to BACs. Tandukar et al. (2013) also explored the antimicrobial resistance of microbial communities after BAC exposure. The study found that such exposures not only selected BAC-tolerant species but concurrently increased their resistance to several clinically relevant antibiotics. Specifically, degradation and transformation were found to be the predominant mechanisms of their tolerance to BACs and resistance to penicillin G, while efflux pumps largely contributed to their resistance to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. Similar effects were reported on chlorine-tolerant bacteria. Jin et al. (2020) elucidated the mechanisms of how chlorination promotes the horizontal transfer of ARGs. The study found that the disinfection process enhanced cell membrane permeability and the oxidative stress response of chlorine-tolerant injured bacteria, where competent cells showed a 550 times higher transformation frequency than untreated bacteria and could easily uptake the free ARGs from the ambient environment. In an earlier study, Zhang et al. (2017) found that exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of three commonly used biocidal agents (chlorine, chloramine, and H 2 O 2 ) facilitated the conjugative transfer of ARGs between Escherichia coli and further from Escherichia coli to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium via intracellular ROS formation, SOS response, increased cell membrane permeabilization, altered expressions or regulations of conjugation relevant genes. It is worth noting that exposure to biocidal agents can lead to further drug resistance in antibioticresistant bacteria. In an early study, Akimitsu et al. (1999) showed that exposure to QACs promoted oxacillin and b-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains (Akimitsu et al., 1999) .\n"," The association between chronic sublethal exposure to biocidal agents and promoted antibiotic resistance has been demonstrated unequivocally in laboratory studies (Jin et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2018b) , although real-world situations are often more complicated. Many field studies have been conducted to explore whether there was indeed a correlation between disinfectant use and antibiotic resistance. Khan et al. (2016) isolated 22 genera of bacteria from chlorinated drinking water systems and evaluated the correlation between sodium hypochlorite tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility. The study found consistent correlations between chlorine tolerance and MIC of several clinically antibiotics including tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin, indicating that drinking water disinfection may indeed induce antibioticresistance in surviving bacteria. Liu et al. (2018) investigated the impact of chlorine disinfection on the promotion of antibiotic resistance in a full-scale wastewater treatment plant over one year. The study showed that chlorine dioxide disinfection increased the abundance of both extracellular and intracellular ARGs up to 3.8 folds and 7.8 folds, respectively. In a different setting, Fernandez Marquez et al. (2017) collected 39 Salmonella isolates from hen eggshells and found a positive link between biocide tolerance and antibiotic resistance. Among those, a total of 29 isolates (74.4%) showed higher MIC than wild-type strains and were determined as tolerant to biocides including benzalkonium chloride (BAC, 7.7%), cetrimide (CT, 7.7%), hexadecylpyridinium chloride (HDP, 10.3%), triclosan (TC, 17.9%), hexachlorophene (CF, 30.8%), and P3-oxonia (OX, 25.6%). The study found that most of the biocide tolerant isolates were resistant to ampicillin (90.5%), followed by chloramphenicol (61.9%), tetracycline (47.6%), and trimethoprime sulfamethoxazole (38.1%). Similar results were reported by de Quadros et al. (2020) where the authors assessed the biocide tolerance and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella serotypes isolated from a swine slaughterhouse. All tested strains (n ¼ 25) were susceptible to 0.5% and 1% peracetic acid and 18 of the 25 tested strain were resistant to 0.5% BAC. The authors found that only four of the tested strains were susceptible to all the seven antibiotics tested, i.e., amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, doxycycline, cefaclor, azithromycin, and enrofloxacin, while other strains showed resistance to one or several antibiotics. Marino et al. (2011) showed that Staphylococci strains isolated from food and food environments were resistant to both QACs and several antibiotics. Fernandez Fuentes et al. (2014) reported that Gram-negative bacteria collected from organic foods were both biocide tolerant and antibiotic resistant, and efflux pumps genes (e.g., acrB, sugE, efrA) and antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., ereA, lsa) were both detected in those species.\n"," The terms 'co-resistance' and 'cross-resistance' are often used to described the adaptive behaviors of microorganisms that are resistant or less susceptible to biocidal agents and antibiotics, although they do have different meanings (Buffet-Bataillon et al., 2012b; Elekhnawy et al., 2020) . Co-resistance means that different tolerance/resistance mechanisms are encoded by the same gene (Buffet-Bataillon et al., 2012b; Elekhnawy et al., 2020) . For instance, Kim et al. (2018b) found that, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, biocide tolerance gene and antibiotic resistance gene are located on the same mobile genetic element. Cross-resistance means that one particular mechanism is responsible for biocide tolerance and antibiotic resistance exhibited by a certain microorganism (Buffet-Bataillon et al., 2012b; Elekhnawy et al., 2020) . One notable example of cross-resistance is that some QAC transporters can also pump out clinical antibiotics (Table 1 ). In reality, many clinical and hospital isolates manifested cross-resistance or coresistance to biocides and antibiotics. Sidhu et al. (2002) found that nearly 50% of clinical staphylococcal strains (118/238) were BAC tolerant, and those strains were more likely be resistant to antibiotics than BAC-sensitive ones. The qacA/B and qacC genes were widely detected in BAC-tolerant isolates, which could be the reason for their resistance to certain antibiotics (Table 1) . Romao et al. (2005) reported that among 35 Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, 73% showed multidrug resistance to antibiotics (mainly ceftazidime, cefepime) and 43% were BAC tolerant. In a later study, Romao et al. (2011) showed that a total of 124 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were all resistant to antibiotics, and 32 showed resistance to two or more antibiotics. Among the 43 antibiotic-resistant isolates tested for disinfectant susceptibility, twenty isolates also showed tolerance to BAC. Buffet-Bataillon et al. Table 1 Efflux determinants conferring increased tolerance to QACs and resistance to antibiotics (adopted with modifications from Tezel and Pavlostathis (2015)).\n"," Typical antibiotic substrates RND YhiUV-TolC, AcrAB-TolC, MexAB-OprM, CmeABC, CmeDEF, SdeXY, OqxAB (2011) collected 153 blood culture isolates of Escherichia coli and assessed the relationship between their QACs MIC and antibiotic resistance. The authors found that cotrimoxazole resistance was correlated with higher MIC of QACs. In a follow-up study, they elucidated the molecular mechanisms that class 1 integron harbored dfrA/sul1 and qacED1 gene cassettes which mediated the increased tolerance to QACs and resistance to cotrimoxazole (Buffet-Bataillon et al., 2012a) . Similar findings were reported by Kadry et al. (2017) where the authors found that class 1 integron was responsible for the increased tolerance to biocides in multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates. In a recent study, Boutarfi et al. (2019) collected 77 Enterobacter isolates from hospital environments and showed that they were tolerant to biocides and resistant to clinically antibiotics. While many filed studies have reported evidence suggesting a link between disinfectant exposure and antibiotic resistance, some studies suggested otherwise (Cole et al., 2003; Maertens et al., 2020; Oggioni et al., 2015; Peyrat et al., 2008; Roedel et al., 2019) . In reality, there may not be a simple cause for such linkage, since in 'real-world' situations antibiotics often exist in complex environments and therefore, the use of disinfectants may not be the only or the primary driving force for the occurrence of antibiotic resistance. Overall, current evidence suggests that disinfectant-induced antibiotic resistance is more likely to become a contributing factor when bacteria are repeatedly exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of biocidal agents in disinfectants. This is plausible given that in practice, the concentration of biocides will be in a continuous gradient from zero to the treatment concentration (Gilbert and McBain, 2003) . Meanwhile, the actual uses of disinfectants by untrained individuals and the wide variety of receiving surfaces and environments differ from an ideal situation, and many factors could affect the disinfection efficacy, potentially leading to subinhibitory concentration exposure. Common risk factors include inadequate cleaning of the surface to be disinfected, materials with porous or complex internal structures that are difficult to access, presence of biofilms, and failure to follow instructions during product storage and use. A lesser known risk factor in disinfectant-induced antibiotic resistance is that some disinfection byproducts (DBPs) e intermediates often generated in chemical disinfection processes e can have mutagenic activities and contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes (Li and Gu, 2019; Lv et al., 2015) . Experiments using three commonly occurring DBPs, namely, trichloroacetic acid, chlorite, and iodoacetic acid, demonstrated that the latter two compounds had antibiotic-like effects and induced antibiotic resistance at both high (near MICs) and low levels (ca. 3% of MICs) . Lv et al. (2014) investigated the association between antibiotic resistance and the mutagenic activities of DBPs by exposing Pseudomonas aeruginosa to dichloroacetonitrile, dibromoacetic acid, potassium bromate, and 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone. Exposed Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed varied degrees of resistance to antibiotics, especially to norfloxacin and polymycin B where the resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased by over 10-fold from control (Lv et al., 2014) . Given the complexity of oxidative disinfection processes e many involving condition-specific pathways and byproducts e the antibiotic-like effects and mutagenic activities of DBPs represent a challenging and under-investigated issue that require further studies as part of the understanding of disinfectant-induced antibiotic resistance in bacteria.\n"," It is generally accepted that disinfectants and antiseptics should be used when there is scientific evidence demonstrating the benefits of use or when there is a strong rationale for doing so. When used properly, disinfectants have been shown to be effective in reducing microbial contamination (Laustsen et al., 2008; Rutala et al., 2019) and preventing infections (Chmielarczyk et al., 2012; Loo, 2015; Robustillo Rodela et al., 2012) , which are particularly important in healthcare settings (Climo et al., 2013; Rutala et al., 2014; Santana et al., 2007) . Their uses are essential in high-risk settings such as healthcare facilities in the current pandemic given the large numbers of patients routinely admitted to these facilities and workers at potential risks of exposure to contaminated surfaces or objects. A more cautious approach, however, is needed to weigh the risks and benefits of their prolonged and often non-discriminated use in other low-risk settings. The constant selective pressures exerted by over a handful of disinfecting agents would inevitably give rise to bacteria that can survive in these environments, and consequently increase the risk of exposure to biocide-tolerant and drug-resistant bacteria for people living by or contacting with these surfaces (Fig. 6 ). Despite the current widespread practice, reports evaluating the correlation between disinfectant use and potential induction of bacterial tolerance or resistance in community-relevant environments are scarce. To date, there has been no study or scholarly discussion on the risk of antimicrobial resistance emerging from the regular use of chemical disinfectants on common touch surfaces in community or public settings, revolving around the current practices during the COVID-19 pandemic or the EPA-approved disinfectants. Pertinent data and findings suggest that one probably should not neglect the emerging risk of community outbreaks of antimicrobial bacteria as unintended consequences of the wide and regular use of chemical disinfectants in a persisting pandemic. In a recent investigation on disinfectant-induced bacterial resistance in confined building environments, Mahnert et al. (2019) identified a significantly lower diversity of microbes with more resistance genes in regularly cleaned and strictly disinfected premises compared with those without such requirements. He et al. (2014) collected 64 samples on common touch surfaces in four fitness centers and two school dormitories in Massachusetts, USA, including weight machines, exercise bikes, dumbbells, boxing gloves, refrigerator door handles, toilet handles, TV remote controls, and bathroom faucet handles. About 9.6% of the isolated bacterial strains (n ¼ 653) were BACtolerant, and the BAC-tolerant strains of Staphylococci were also resistant to erythromycin, penicillin, and ampicillin. Notably, all BAC-tolerant strains were identified in samples collected from surfaces upon which antibacterial wipes or sprays (containing 0.02%e0.12% BAC) had been frequently applied, while strains isolated from non-antibacterial cleaned surfaces were all susceptible to BAC. In a randomized double-blind trial, 224 households in a northern Manhattan neighborhood completed a twelve-month study on bacterial resistance emerged from the routine use of antibacterial cleaning products containing QACs. Upon completion of the study, BAC-insensitive bacterial isolates were found in households assigned with antibacterial cleaning products, which also exhibited resistance to one or multiple types of clinical antibiotics (Carson et al., 2008) . In a recent study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, Zheng et al. (2020) found increased QAC concentrations in 40 indoor dust samples collected from residential homes in Indiana, USA. The increased exposure to QACs was associated with the frequent use of disinfectants by occupants during the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020) and the accumulation of those compounds on indoor atmospheric particulate matter. Similar findings were reported in an earlier study where the concentrations of triclosan, a common phenolic disinfectant, were positively correlated with the abundance of an antibiotic resistance gene in indoor dusts (Hartmann et al., 2016) .\n"," One of the particular risk factors associated with community-emerged bacterial tolerance or resistance is their direct transfers to humans. There have been plenty of reports on human acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pathogens in community and public settings, before the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (Kang et al., 2006; King et al., 2006; Morozumi et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2012; Tao et al., 2012; Wise et al., 2011) . Adding to this risk, many common bacterial pathogens such as Enterococcus spp., Shigella spp., Listeria spp., Klebsiella spp., Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) could survive for months on dry inanimate surfaces (Kramer et al., 2006) . Several routes of microorganism transfers could eventuate from the human interactions with the surrounding environments, of which the surface-to-hand transfer is the most common route. Davis et al. (2012) reported that human infections of MRSA were typically associated with contaminated high touch surfaces in indoor environments. In a six-month study, Lax et al. (2014) demonstrated the close link between the hands of indoor occupants and common touch surfaces (e.g., countertop, floor, door knob), where an occupant's hand shared 84% of genes with those present on a kitchen countertop, suggesting substantial transfers of microorganisms from inanimate surfaces to humans in indoor environments. In a subsequent study, Lax et al. (2017) found high resemblance between the microbiota present on patients' skins and those on in-hospital surfaces, suggesting that bacterial communities can transfer in both directions between humans and the surrounding surfaces (Lax et al., 2017) . Rusin et al. (2002) measured the transfer efficiency of pathogens from surface to hands and further from fingers to lips. The highest transfer rates were observed on hard, nonporous surfaces where the number of bacteria transferred from surface to hand could reach up to 10 6 cells with a 10 s contact. Substantial transfers of bacteria from fingers to lips were also found, with rates up to 40% identified in the study. Lastly, it is worth noting that the likelihood of acquired human infection is not only determined by bacterial transfer efficiency or effective doses of bacteria transferred, but the specific type of pathogens being transferred to human. For instance, the minimal infectious dose of Shigella spp. was below 10 CFU while an equivalent dose of some Salmonella spp. was beyond 10 5 CFU (Gerhardts et al., 2012) . It should be noted that, in practice, disinfectants are often used at concentrations considerably higher than minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) or minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) to achieve rapid killing, and it is unlikely for bacteria to survive and develop resistance under normal circumstances (Weber and Rutala, 2006) . Further, the antibiotic resistance promoted by exposure to disinfectants, as described in some studies (Langsrud et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2017) , may not be clinically relevant because the test organism may not be a human pathogen, the altered level of antimicrobial susceptibility was within achievable serum levels for the antibiotic, or the antibiotic tested was not clinically used to treat the concerned pathogen. Although strains with reduced susceptibility to disinfectants have been reported outside laboratories (de Quadros et al., 2020; Fernandez Marquez et al., 2017) , the concentration of disinfectants used in healthcare settings usually greatly exceeds the concentration required to kill strains with reduced susceptibility to disinfectants. Overall, from the current evidence, reports on disinfectantpromoted antibiotic resistance should not discourage the appropriate use of disinfectants, but more studies should be carried on the proposed linkage between disinfectant uses and antibiotic resistance, particularly in real-life scenarios outside laboratories and under community or environmentally relevant conditions.\n"," Meanwhile, one should also be aware that the actual scenarios of use can vary greatly, and many factors can contribute to the situation where the bacteria may be exposed to sub-lethal levels of biocides from the inappropriate uses of disinfectants. Apart from human errors and misuses , confounding factors such as the inappropriate dilution of disinfectants, co-existence of biocide-exhausting substances (e.g., due to inadequate cleaning prior to disinfection), insufficient contact, and disturbance during the disinfection process are among the common issues encountered in disinfectant uses (Cerf et al., 2010; Elekhnawy et al., 2020; Fig. 6 . A schematic illustration on the potential growth of disinfectant-tolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria on contact surfaces in community and public settings, posing risks of direct transfers to humans. With a highly non-diverse spectrum of biocidal agents in disinfectant products approved for COVID-19, these unintended consequences may arise from the regular and intensive surface disinfecting during COVID-19 and perhaps extended to the post-pandemic area. Rutala and Weber, 2018; Song et al., 2019) . Further, the methods of how disinfectants are applied in practice (e.g., wipe, sprays, or gels) and the characteristics of receiving surfaces or objects (e.g., porous or having complex internal structures) can also influence the efficacy of disinfection (Rutala and Weber, 2018; Song et al., 2019) . Under these circumstances, bacteria can be, in theory, exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of biocides. Such risks may be aggravated in the current pandemic due to the widespread and non-discriminated use of disinfectants in non-conventional settings.\n"," The regular and persisting use of chemical disinfectants in community and public settings under the current circumstance may bring unintended consequences e constant selective pressures exerted on microbiota not only can increase their tolerance to biocidal agents but their resistance to certain antibiotics. Such risks are likely to be exacerbated by the non-diverse portfolio of active ingredients used in current 535 disinfectant products approved for COVID-19. While these risks are widely overlooked in recent scholarly discussions and regulatory guidelines, ample evidence has shown disinfectant-induced resistance in many bacterial pathogens with their mechanisms elucidated under laboratory and environmental relevant settings. For many bacteria, tolerance to biocidal agents can be intrinsic or acquired, specifically, via mutations and horizontal gene transfer, membrane alterations, upregulation of efflux pumps, biofilm formation, as well as other mechanisms conferring tolerance to specific biocides. Importantly, some biocides and degradation byproducts are known to further induce antibiotic resistance in bacteria. While there is a strong suspected link between disinfectant use and community-emerged bacterial resistance, the underlying risks of human acquisition of resistant bacterial pathogens from the surrounding surfaces in community and public settings have been barely assessed in the COVID-19 context. Meanwhile, existing data and evidence suggest that hand contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is a prevalent route of bacterial transfer to humans in these environments, where transfer rates from hard, nonporous surfaces to hands were found to be generally high, with substantial transfers further from fingers to lips. Under current regulatory guidelines, common touch surfaces may become 'hotspots' for the growth of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and subsequent transfers to members of the public, especially in places with high user occupancy or foot traffic.\n"," In the midst of a prolonging pandemic where regular surface disinfection remains an essential means of reducing the virus spread, and that scientific evidence demonstrated that disinfectants are beneficial in reducing microbial contamination and preventing infectious when used properly, we propose the following actions to be considered for mitigating the risks of communityemerged biocide-tolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and consequent transfers to humans from surrounding surfaces and environments. First, it is essential to remove dirt and debris from the surfaces and objects before spraying or wiping them with disinfectants. Then, users must carefully read the labels on disinfectant products prior to their use and comply with the instructions. To avoid exposing microorganisms at subinhibitory conditions, care must be taken to ensure that products are current (non-expired), intact (no leakage or visible damage on packaging), properly stored (e.g., no direct sunlight or excessive heat), and applied on desired surfaces or objects in adequate amounts for sufficient periods of time. Where possible, alternating the use of disinfectant products with unrelated active ingredients can mitigate the emergence of increased biocide tolerance. As a precaution, proper hand hygiene should be maintained by community members to minimize transfers of bacterial pathogens from regularly disinfected touch surfaces or objects to humans. Children and crawling infants should be given more attention to maintain good hand hygiene and minimize hand-to-face bacterial transfers. Lastly, given the fact that regular disinfection also greatly reduces microbial diversity, maintaining natural ventilation and plantation can diminish the competitive advantages of bacterial pathogens selected by biocidal agents, and help restore the microbial diversity in affected environments. As the current pandemic progresses into the twelfth month, and community-wide surface disinfecting remains an essential measure to control the virus spread, we call for attention of regulatory bodies and the scientific community on these underlying risks and mitigation measures. Future studies on the consequences of prolonged and intensive community-wide surface disinfecting could focus on current knowledge gaps on: i) the extent to which the disinfectant-induced bacterial resistance to antibiotics occurred in real-world environments and whether the emerged antibiotic resistance is clinically relevant and to what extent it affects the efficacy of antibiotic treatment; ii) human acquisition of biocide-tolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens from surrounding surfaces and environments, focusing on community and public settings that are in close proximity to humans and most severely impacted by disinfectant use during the current pandemic and possibly into the post-pandemic era.\n"," The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n","Score: 7.031151088658477\n","\n","Title: Mitigating the Twin Threats of Climate-Driven Atlantic Hurricanes and COVID-19 Transmission\n","Body Text: In 2020, the converging threats of climate-driven hurricanes and active coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission vastly complicate the process of preparing coastal and island-based populations for seasonal hurricane risks. Response is impeded by fundamental incompatibilities between the most effective population protection strategies for each of these hazards. The proven pillars of hurricane mitigationevacuation and shelteringbring people together, transporting them in groups and shielding them inside fortified structures.

[6] [7] [8] [9] [10] In search of workable solutions for protecting populations, despite conflicting approaches, we examine (1) how climate change may be making Atlantic hurricanes more dangerous;\n"," (2) how COVID-19's ease of transmissibility complicates hurricane preparedness; (3) how evacuation and sheltering procedures may spread COVID-19; and (4) how communities can creatively manage concurrent hurricane and pandemic threats in 2020, when there is no COVID-19 vaccine.\n"," There is mounting evidence that climate change is making hurricanes more hazardous while rendering island and coastal communities more vulnerable. 11, 12 Recent hurricane seasons have showcased how climate change is likely contributing to stronger, wetter, and slower-moving Atlantic storms as they come onshore over populated areas. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Hurricane Dorian's devastation of the northwest Bahamas in 2019 provides a compelling example of this trifecta of storm characteristics. 21, 22 Now, in 2020, climate scientists are forecasting an above-average Atlantic hurricane season. 23, 24 Populations at greatest risk for direct strikes from Atlantic storms are residents of small island states spread throughout the Caribbean and persons living along the east coast of the United States, Mexico, and Central America.\n"," Hurricanes are tropical cyclones, rotating systems of thunderstorms that form over tropical or subtropical waters, have a low-level closed circulation, 25 and predominantly move westward and poleward. [26] [27] [28] Rotating winds are the signature hazard and the basis for categorizing hurricane strength and damage potential. 11, 25 Water hazards, including storm surge, coastal wave action, intense precipitation, and inland freshwater flooding, produce the greatest peril. 11, 17, 19, 25 Increased Atlantic hurricane activity has been observed over the past 50 years. 11, 14 Human actions, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, cause Earth to retain more heat energy than it releases, altering the climate system and shaping hurricane behavior, acting through the intermediaries of \"climate drivers.\" 29 Climate drivers include anomalously warm ocean and air temperatures (7 consecutive years, 2014-2020, are the hottest on record), warm ocean waters extending far down into the depths of the sea, and increased atmospheric moisture holding capacity. 11, [16] [17] [18] [19] 30 Climate drivers amplify hurricane hazardspeak wind speeds, intensification rates, rainfall totals, and flood risks. 13, 20 Sea level rise, linked to the thermal expansion of warm ocean waters and the melting of polar ice, exacerbates hurricane damage from storm surge and coastal wave erosion. Higher seas, propelled by stronger winds, overtop coastal dwellings and severely damage the built environment. Climate-driven storms cause protracted power outages and disrupt health care services. Physical and mental health consequences and stormrelated mortality may cascade for months following impact ( Figure 1 ). 12, 13, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] As the climate progressively alters the behavior of Atlantic storms, upgrading measures to safeguard communities in the path has never been more urgently needed.\n"," What distinguishes the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is that population protection from extreme storms is on a collision course with the onward-marching COVID-19 pandemic. 38 Despite impressive progress toward developing a safe, 2 Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness tolerable, immunogenic COVID-19 vaccine, population immunization will not be underway prior to the peak months of the 2020 season. 39, 40 In the absence of a vaccine, the critical mainstays of hurricane mitigation, evacuation, and sheltering actions that move and gather people togethermay inadvertently facilitate the spread of COVID-19. To better understand the infectious disease risks inherent in hurricane sheltering and evacuation, we describe what is known about the ease of transmission of COVID-19 in relation to epidemic patterning, transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the virus that causes COVID- 19) , and human behaviors in community settings.\n"," COVID-19 transmission occurred at an astonishing speed, circumnavigating the planet during the single month of March 2020 with more than 200 countries and territories reporting cases to the World Health Organization. 38 As a novel coronavirus and emerging \"spillover\" zoonotic disease, the entire world population (7.8 billion persons) is susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. 41 COVID-19 has a comparable or higher reproduction number (R 0 ) than influenza; on average, each infected, and infectious, person will spread the virus to multiple other persons, leading to sustained transmission. 42, 43 One plausible scenario is that a second, potentially more virulent, COVID-19 pandemic wave will sweep the globe, beginning during the later months of the Atlantic hurricane season. 42 Furthermore, COVID-19 transmission may diminish but will not disappear during the hot, humid peak months of the Atlantic hurricane season. 44 Therefore, when evacuation warnings are issued and shelters are opened, COVID-19 will be viable and circulating in the communities that are taking evacuation and sheltering precautions as a hurricane approaches.\n"," Airborne spread through large droplet nuclei, submicron aerosols, and turbulent gas clouds poses a great risk for rapid transmission. [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] The common guidance to observe 6 feet of separationbased on large droplet nuclei generally traveling less than this distance and settling quicklyis likely inadequate, particularly in enclosed spaces like shelters. Smaller particles can be detected, suspended in air, at much larger distances. 49, 52 When shelteringwhether in homes or community shelters -COVID-19 transmission can still occur even if persons sheltering together attentively maintain 6 feet of separation. SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by direct contact with persons who are shedding the virus or with contaminated high-touch surfaces or inanimate objects (fomites). 49-51 COVID-19 spread from persons who show no symptoms (asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread) has been documented worldwide. [54] [55] [56] [57] Asymptomatic transmission undermines the ability to screen people using temperature and health checks at the entrance to community shelters; some persons who are symptom-free will nevertheless be infectious and capable of infecting others. SARS-CoV-2 has already undergone a spike mutation, resulting in a more transmissible strain that produces higher viral loads, rising to prominence globally. 58 \n"," In the United States, nationwide easing of mitigation measures began shortly before the beginning of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, actions that may increase the appearance of case clusters, sporadic superspreading events, 59,60 and possible large-scale resurgence that may extend throughout the peak months of the hurricane season. 61 Daily case counts were already rising within the first month for states that rapidly relaxed restrictions.\n"," Collectively, these epidemic patterns and SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, coupled with individual and collective actions that may restimulate community transmission, elevate COVID-19 risks during hurricane evacuation and sheltering procedures ( Figure 2 ).\n"," Mitigation strategies for Atlantic hurricanes and for COVID-19 include some commonalities but also important incompatibilities. We examine stockpiling, sheltering, and evacuation strategies.\n"," Preparing for both hurricanes and COVID-19 includes stockpiling survival supplies. Since the inception of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in March 2020, many households have stocked up on drinking water, non-perishable foods, and paper goods; similar basics are recommended for sheltering in place during hurricanes. Supplies for COVID-19 lockdowns also prioritize soaps, bleach, alcohol disinfectants, and anti-bacterial wipes. Hurricane stockpiling features items needed for prolonged power outages: batteries, flashlights, weather radios, cell phone chargers, grills, and generators. Procuring multiple months of prescription medications, keeping gas tanks full, and having extra cash on hand are common to both. COVID-19 has made citizens more alert and attentive to disaster warnings and more attuned to media messaging.\n"," On the downside, some high-demand essentials, including toilet paper and cleaning supplies, are chronically or cyclically out of stock. Some areas experience sporadic shortages of fresh produce and meats. In the context of the scope and scale of COVID-19, strains on the food supply and vital supplies may extend to regional, national, or even global levels. Increasing numbers of families are already dependent on government financial assistance and drive-through mass feeding programs to meet their nutritional needs. Emergency managers are planning for contingencies where, following hurricane impact, \n"," Sheltering residents in storm-resistant structures, located inland and away from coastlines, is a stalwart among hurricane mitigation strategies. Population sheltering operates in tandem with effective hurricane tracking, timely warnings, and planned evacuation of coastal zones at high risk for storm surge and high-velocity wind damage. Together, these proven strategies have decreased hurricane-related injuries and deaths. These procedures are initiated in advance of hurricane landfall throughout coastal communities and island states located in the forecast \"cone\" of an oncoming Atlantic storm.\n"," Most residents whose homes are not in evacuation zones elect to shelter in place inside their own homes; for these families, COVID-19 risks would remain unchanged if the composition of the household stays the same. However, COVID-19 risks rise if the residents invite family members or friends to join them. On the flipside, many families living in evacuation zones prearrange to \"double up\" in the inland homes of relatives. However, in 2020, these well-tested sheltering options that gather people together in a confined space may set off household-level case clusters of COVID-19.\n"," Congregate sheltering involves safeguarding a large number of evacuees housed inside structurally durable community \"mass care\" centers operated by local emergency management with staff supplementation from county employees or American Red Cross volunteers. Traditionally, large spaces (eg, school gymnasiums) are used for most shelter residents, and, historically, each individual is allotted a 4-by 5-foot space (that may be reduced to 3-by 5-foot spacing when larger numbers are seeking refuge). Now, in the pre-vaccine era of COVID-19, these mass sheltering arrangements represent the antithesis of physical distancing. Placing local residents from diverse neighborhoods together in an enclosed space for a prolonged duration elevates risk for spreading COVID-19. 62 As a partial solution, emergency managers are planning to open more smaller spaces within large designated shelters (eg, using individual classrooms inside schools). Fortunately, only a small proportion of citizens rely on community shelters. For \n"," In 2020, many communities are exploring ways to expand shelter accommodations to allow smaller groups to shelter with more physical space and bathrooms (to maintain hygiene) per resident. This approach features \"non-congregate sheltering,\" opening locations where each individual or household has living space that offers some level of privacy (like hotels, motels, casinos, dormitories, or retreat camps). 5\n"," Some families with financial means make their own shelter plans (eg, reserving hotel rooms or campground spaces, renting a recreational vehicle) that facilitate physical distancing in settings away from coastlines and the projected path of the storm.\n"," A proportion of the population will be unable to return to their homes due to structural damage, flooding, immovable debris, and infrastructure disruptions. 2 Temporary housing options will be arranged for displaced survivors; and again this raises COVID-19 contagion risks. Depending upon the geographic extent of damage, numbers of households affected, and available options for emergency housing, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will take an active role and may need to call in the US military for support following catastrophic storm strikes.\n"," Historically, hurricane evacuation has successfully decreased direct exposure to storm hazards and concomitant risks for physical harm and psychological trauma. However, in 2020, evacuation raises COVID-19 risks for those who evacuate and those who host evacuees.\n"," Evacuation often involves a marathon obstacle course of gridlocked highways, motor vehicle crash scenes, and fuel shortages along the route. Specific to COVID-19, the party traveling together will share the close confines of a vehicle for many hours or several days. Along the way, there may be periodic encounters with concentrated groups of strangers at freeway plazas, rest stops, restaurants, or crowded hotels. Those who opt to fly to a safe locale will experience COVID-19 risks in airport departure lounges and onboard their flights.\n"," In 2020, evacuation will move COVID-19 along with the travelers, endangering persons at the destination point. Already in early 2020, many residents of COVID-19 epicenters in the northeastern United States migrated to second homes along the hurricane coast, particularly in south Florida; they set off clusters of COVID-19 cases when they arrived. Similarly, hurricane evacuees will almost certainly include presymptomatic persons who are infectious and may transmit COVID-19 to fellow evacuees, persons they encounter where they stop to eat and rest along the route, and those who receive them at the end of their travels.\n"," The high proportions of persons who do not heed evacuation orders pose a perennial problem; these persons sustain severe preventable injuries, place first responders who must rescue them at risk, and fill the surge beds at area medical centers. A primary concern in 2020 is that fear of contracting COVID-19 will cause even more residents to stay in their homes and be exposed to injurious, climate-amplified hurricane hazards. \n"," When considering the formidable challenges in dealing with a hurricane while COVID-19 is circulating in the community, there are no easy solutions available to neutralize both threats simultaneously and eliminate offsetting risks. However, there are ways to limit medical and psychological trauma from exposure to hurricane hazards while minimizing an uptick in COVID-19 transmission.\n"," There is a compelling need to focus energies on solutions for a twin threat scenario during the 2020 hurricane season while no COVID-19 vaccine is available. Experts predict that a safe, effective vaccine will be available for population-wide immunization in early 2021. If this prediction is borne out, the double-risk scenario may not recur during future hurricane seasons.\n"," Research suggests that the non-pharmaceutical interventions and anti-contagion policies invoked around the globe in early 2020 have spared hundreds of millions of persons worldwide (including an estimated 60 million in the United States) from contracting COVID-19. 1, 9 During the pre-vaccine period of global vulnerability to COVID-19, continuing throughout the 2020 hurricane season and into early 2021, the greatest leverage to minimize harm from a combined hurricane-\n"," Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness 5 Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness pandemic disaster scenario is to continue to observe precautions to limit the spread of COVID-19, even as steps are taken to reopen portions of society. It will be much safer to shelter or evacuateand to elect to take these protective actionsif viral transmission in the storm-threatened community remains subdued. Along the hurricane coast, this will require continued physical distancing, avoidance of mass gatherings, continued use of masks, and careful adherence to handwashing, coupled with diligent public health surveillance (case identification, isolation, quarantine, and contact tracing).\n"," The need to modify operational protocols at congregate shelters to reduce risks for COVID-19 transmission has received concerted attention from both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and FEMA. CDC released guidance on sheltering that attempts to balance the competing risks of minimizing exposure to hurricane hazards and reducing the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission. 1 The National Mass Care Strategy has produced documents on related themes: COVID-19 congregate sheltering, feeding procedures in congregate shelters, and non-congregate sheltering. 3-5 CDC asserts, \"Large congregate shelters should be the last resort.\" 1 CDC recommends \"sheltering in place\" when possible as the optimal choice. Using \"non-congregate\" sites, including hotels, dormitories, and small shelters accommodating fewer than 50 residents is the next most preferred choice. 1, 5 When mass care shelters must be opened, CDC recommends speedy demobilization as soon as the storm passes to minimize time spent in a shared public space. All persons who use mass shelters are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days after leaving the shelter.\n"," CDC focuses on COVID-19 infection control in community shelter settings. 1, 3 This includes daily symptom checks (temperature, respiratory symptoms, shortness of breath). Residents with symptoms would be isolated away from others in the shelter. All residents would be required to wear masks, stay within their assigned spaces (generally 6 feet apart from others), and eat sanitized and prepackaged meals. 1, 3, 4 Handwashing stations would be set up along with continuous cleansing and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces.\n"," FEMA's 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic Operation Guidance for the 2020 Hurricane Season (POG) provides high-level guidance for local emergency managers to consider when dealing with the COVID-19-transformed risk landscape in their communities. 2 The POG is replete with checklists that include sheltering considerations both during and after the storm. Infection control precautions emphasize having adequate supplies of cleansing agents and personal protective equipment. FEMA also focuses on protecting nursing home residents and special needs populations at elevated risk for COVID-19. 2\n"," One solution that is overlooked and must be prioritized is to adapt and extend infection control guidance developed for congregate shelters for use by large segments of the public who will be sheltering together in homes with family and friends. Many of the same principles apply in mass shelters and in homes or smaller sheltered enclavesspace people apart, do not share food and utensils, wear masks, wash hands meticulously, check for symptoms, separate anyone who is ill. Currently, critical information on how to shelter safely with friends and family is not being communicated to the public.\n"," A primary unknown for emergency managers is whether, in the era of COVID-19, residents will evacuate when warned to do so. Historically, high proportions of persons have failed to heed mandatory evacuation orders. [63] [64] [65] Studies have examined motivations for evacuating, or refusing to evacuate, and there are few consistent findings. Evacuation was more common for younger ages, female gender, white race, and families with children. 64 Those who were warned by a trusted source such as a city official and those who perceived higher risks for harm and damage (from stronger storms) were more likely to evacuate. Surviving previous near-miss experiences and believing that one's home is structurally secure decrease the likelihood of evacuation. Importantly, in the studies reviewed, only 1 hazard was in play (eg, hurricane, wildfire, flood) and evacuation moved people away from that hazard to safety. In 2020, with twin competing threats, evacuation transports people away from the ravages of a hurricane but potentially into situations that raise risks for COVID-19. How persons will weigh these competing risks is not well understood.\n"," Framing and communicating the risks will be critical. The public needs to know that (1) Atlantic hurricanes have never been more hazardous, (2) responding to evacuation orders is essential for family safety, and (3) sheltering options can be made safer by taking precautions to minimize the spread of COVID-19. Former FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, has alerted the nation to the reality that \"emergency communications will be the next challenge of COVID-19.\" 66 An individual's risk perception informs their decision-making, especially in the context of profound uncertainty as COVID-19 risks interweave with protective options to safeguard families from hurricane hazards. This means trusted information from reliable sources is even more essential. Fugate's advice for responding to evacuation orders in 2020 is simple, concise, and precise (Box 1).\n"," For years, hurricane shelters have physically isolated persons who arrive with evident illness symptoms and \"reverse-isolated\" those Evacuation Guidance for the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season • Standard evacuation message is even more applicable for dealing with COVID-19.\n"," • COVID-19 or no COVID-19, if you live in a hurricane evacuation zone, plan now to leave if a storm is threatening and you are ordered to evacuate. • If you live in a hurricane evacuation zone:\n"," • Move inland to a safer location.\n"," • For US coastal communities, evacuate 10s of miles rather than 100s of miles.\n"," • Know where you will go.\n"," • Evacuate to a shelter with family or friends outside of the evacuation zone.\n"," • Other options: hotels or motels.\n"," • Consider temporary facilities activated by the US Army Corp of Engineers as COVID-19 alternative care sites.\n"," • As the last resort evacuate to an emergency public shelterand take your pets with you. • If you live outside of the evacuation zone:\n"," • If safe, staying home may be your best option.\n"," • Prepare for extended power outages.\n"," • Prepare for disruptions to communications (keep a portable radio in your disaster kit). • Fewer people evacuating reduces the risk of COVID-19 spread and allows those who must evacuate to use available hotels and motels. The literature on infectious disease outbreaks in shelters is scant. However, lessons can be drawn from the rare outbreak involving 20 cases of influenza A (H3) in a densely populated Texas \"megashelter,\" housing more than 3300 survivors from 2017 Hurricane Harvey for 4 weeks. 67 Authors described their \"holistic surveillance and response\" model, coordination among onsite agencies, real-time epidemiologic surveillance, and enhanced isolation and hygiene practices to limit spread. One major distinction: influenza vaccine was available and used to immunize other residents.\n"," Predictions call for multiple landfalling 2020 storms. Starting with Tropical Storm Cristobal that came ashore along the US Gulf Coast on June 8, it is important to rapidly generate and share after-action reports that examine shelter operations and mandated evacuations. Lessons gleaned early in the season can refine and shape evacuation and sheltering protocols to improve mitigation procedures when stronger storms threaten and strike later in the season.\n"," Dr. Frederick Burkle, Jr., shared his keen observations, providing context for the current COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing climate crisis, and derivative combined threat scenarios that may increasingly become the new normal (Box 2). 68,69\n"," We have now documented (1) how climate change influences the hazard properties of Atlantic hurricanes, making them more dangerous;\n"," (2) what we are learning about the transmission of COVID-19 that must be integrated into plans for hurricane mitigation; (3) how various options for evacuation and sheltering influence the spread of COVID-19; and (4) how communities can manage concurrent threats of climate-driven Atlantic hurricanes superimposed on COVID-19 transmission risks. It is imperative to forthrightly provide timely, multidisciplinary scientific, and pragmatic information about both risksspecific to the storm and specific to the current status of COVID-19 in the imperiled communityto guide individuals, their households, their communities, and decision-makers to select the best options to protect life and emerge resilient.\n","Score: 6.9992102705764285\n","\n","Title: Sponge Whirl-Pak Sampling Method and Droplet Digital RT-PCR Assay for Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 on Surfaces in Public and Working\n","Body Text: On 31st December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported a number of unusual cases of pneumonia of unknown origin to the World Health Organization (WHO) in the town of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1] . Most of the cases were epidemiologically associated with a market of live animals (Huanan South China Seafood Market), suggesting a possible zoonotic origin (transmission from animals to humans [2] ). On 7 January 2020, a new beta-coronavirus was detected through the use of unbiased sequencing in samples from patients with pneumonia. Subsequently, the Chinese authorities reported the identification of a new virus belonging to the same coronavirus family as \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) [3] . Because of the rapid spread of the virus, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the local Chinese authorities announced that a human-to-human transmission had occurred. On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic [4] . Epidemiological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can spread directly via saliva, respiratory aerosol and droplets, and indirectly by contact through contaminated objects and/or surfaces. The person-toperson spreading of SARS-CoV-2 occurs mainly through respiratory droplets, which a patient expels when coughing, sneezing, or speaking. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to remain intact in droplets suspended in the air for up to three hours [5] [6] [7] . Beside direct transmission through the contact between mucous membranes (mouth, eyes, nose) and infected droplets, SARS-CoV-2 can infect humans indirectly, when hands come to contact with mucosae after touching an infected person or contaminated objects [8] . As underlined by Kraay et al. (2018) , the fomites have a crucial role as potential transmission vehicles of respiratory viruses or other pathogens [9, 10] . In particular, the transmission mediated by fomites depends on behavioural factors (i.e., hand hygiene practices), on the physical environment (i.e., factors affecting virus viability) and on the type of surfaces that may undergo contamination. The dynamics in fomites contamination and transmission appear to be very complex as it involves multiple variables.\n"," Studies conducted over the last two years, indeed, highlighted the impact of factors such as temperature, surface porosity, relative humidity, air drying, and direct light on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity retention, either on surfaces or in air [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In addition to this, the different persistence of the virus on surfaces of different natures (plastic, cardboard, metal, etc.) have been assessed [17] [18] [19] [20] and predictive tools and mathematical models have been developed to calculate virus decay on surfaces based on multiple factors [21] . In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, fomites have been considered a relevant vehicle of virus transmission, contributing to the risk of infection in public environments such as schools, long-term care facilities and hospitals [22] [23] [24] [25] . In this context, several studies have addressed the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces in close contact with COVID-19 patients, either in hospital and healthcare settings [26] [27] [28] [29] , in households and isolation rooms [30] [31] [32] or in specific settings such as a cruise ship during outbreak events [33] . Less investigated, on the contrary, has been the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (either genome or infectious virus) in public spaces or in other working environments. A study performed by Silva and colleagues (2021) [34] on public urban areas in Recife, Brazil showed high positivity rates in public transportation terminals (>50%), public parks, supply centers, and markets, with toilets, bancomat, handrails, playgrounds, and other highly touched public surfaces being frequently positive for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, sampling on public urban surfaces (crosswalk buttons, trash can handles, door handles of essential commercial services such as grocery shops, banks, gas stations, etc.) in Somerville, Massachusetts, USA between March and June 2020, achieved the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 8.3% of samples [35] and sampling in playgrounds and on water fountains in six cities in Israel in August 2020 showed the presence of viral genome in~4% of the samples [36] . Detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material on public transportation has also been addressed by several authors, with results ranging from a 17% positivity rate in transports in Quito, Ecuador [37] to 43% in Barcelona, Spain [38] . In Italy, a first study on public transportation was performed in the city of Chieti (Abruzzo region, central Italy) in May 2020 with no detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces [39] , but a more extensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 deposition on surfaces in public places/services has been performed in the region of Apulia, where virus presence has been investigated in supermarkets (detection in 4.3% of samples), public transportation, such as trains and buses (10.7% of positive results), and tourist recreational facilities (virus detection in 6% of swabs) [40] [41] [42] , but no data are available for other kind of environments and for other areas of the country. These studies consider public transportation in urban areas (with high population density conditions). Moreover, the observed differences in the percentage of positivity rate could also depend on (i) the time when the study was conducted (i.e., during the first wave of contagion, March-April 2020, Italian public transportation were not frequented and, with major turnout in northern Italy rather than southern); (ii) the levels of viruses spreading at the time of surfaces sampling; (iii) the different design of the study, including the samples collection methods. Considering the analytical aspect, the current gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on the real-time RT-PCR. The low levels of virus contamination are the main obstacles for the application of RT-PCR for the detection of viruses on surfaces. Furthermore, sensitivity of the method is not always enough to detect the low viral concentration. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is an alternative PCR method that allows absolute quantification and is more precise than standard PCR. These properties make ddPCR a promising SARS-CoV-2 detection method for samples with low template.\n"," The purpose of the present study was to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces of widely different environments: (I) two types of public environments, buses for public transportation and a supermarket; (II) a receptive structure involved in a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak associated to a wedding party; (III) 17 farms in the territory of the Campania region chosen based on the detection of a SARS-CoV-2 infection among the employees.\n"," We focused our attention on disparate environments, and the criteria of selection was based on the perceived risks (no medical areas, but highly frequented work environments without standard protocol of biohazard management for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic).\n"," Sampling was carried out between 14 August 2020 and 14 April 2021 in 17 farms, 4 public transportation buses, 1 supermarket and 1 hotel receptive structure distributed in the territory of the Campania region ( Figure 1 ). Farm sites were chosen due to connection to a previously notified case of SARS-CoV-2, involving either employees or visitors. For 6 of the 17 farms investigated, in the two months preceding sampling, five COVID-19 cases (and two fatalities) were reported in workers (one of them being a regular visitor of two farms). Based on available records, farms were managed in agreement with legislation on hygiene, animal welfare and biocontainment (where relevant), but no specific protocol besides general hygiene, distancing and face mask rules was implemented for SARS-CoV-2 in these working environments. The 17 animal farms included: buffaloes (n = 4), cattle (n = 1), goats and cattle (n = 1), goats (n = 2), hens (n = 2), horses (n = 2), pigs (n = 3), pigeons (n = 1), and rabbits (n = 1), and sampling points included milking parlor surfaces, barkers, stable walls.\n"," The 4 public transportation buses and the supermarket were subjected to daily sanitization practices, in agreement with recommendations implemented during the COVID-19 epidemic, and sampling was performed after cleaning and before the service. Sampling points on public transportation buses included handrails, stop request buttons, walls, handles, holding supports, stamping machines, etc., and trolley and cart handles, fridge/freezer handles, weighing scales, card readers, etc. in the supermarket.\n"," Finally, the hotel receptive structure-also operating under the guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 transmission containment-was included in the study following its involvement in a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (20 cases infected during a wedding party) and the environmental sampling of the surfaces bar countertop, tap, kitchen table, fridge and table, dining room tables was carried out one week after the event and after sanitization.\n"," Sponge swipe was conducted using a 3.8 × 7.6 × 1.5 cm sterile sponge (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) moistened with sterile peptone water (LabRobot products, Stenungsund, Sweden). During the sampling procedure, the area to be sampled (100 cm 2 ) was identified, the bag containing the dehydrated sponge was opened and 10 mL of diluent was added to hydrate the sponge. Subsequently, the sponge was vigorously swiped on the previously defined area, first with horizontal and then with vertical movements. At the end of sampling, the sponge was placed back in its own bag, sealed by rolling the upper edge several times and placed in an insulated container equipped with dry ice packs. Transport to the laboratory for analysis was completed as soon as possible and in any case within 24 h of sampling.\n"," To better understand the role of the environment in potential virus transmission in a complex environment such as an animal farm, each environmental (sponge) sampling was associated with sampling on human subjects (workers of the farms) and on animals. For the humans, nasopharyngeal swabs were performed, under the authorization of the GENCOVID study protocol \"Health surveillance for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible of COVID-19 pandemic in high-risk population or in people in direct contact with positive patients\" (approved by the ethics committee of University of Naples \"Federico II\", approval n • 141/20). For animals, either nasopharyngeal (buffaloes, pigs, rabbits, horses, goats, cattle) or oropharyngeal (hens and pigeons) swabs were performed. Both human and animal samplings were performed using the Copan UTM-RT system (Universal Transport Medium for Viruses) with FLOQSwabs (Copan Diagnostics, CA, USA). Samples were transported to the laboratory with triple packaging under controlled temperature (4 • C).\n"," Overall, a total of 77 environmental samples (sponge-S), 246 animal swabs (AS) and 93 human swabs (HS) ( Table 1) were taken, divided as follows: 12 AS, 2 HSand 10 S in the province of Naples, 97AS, 39HSand 13 S in the province of Caserta, 100AS, 44HSand 51 S in the province of Salerno, 16AS, 6HSand 1 S in the province of Benevento, 21AS, 2 HSand 2 S in the province of Avellino. \n"," For nucleic acids extraction from environmental samples, 20 mL Proteinase K solution (100 µg mL −1 ) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were added to sponge bags. Extraction efficiency was monitored by the addition of 30 µL of internal process control (IPC) virus (Mengo virus strain MC 0 ). Samples were incubated at 37 • C for 60 min, followed by 15 min at 60 • C and all liquid was recovered squeezing the sampling sponge. Finally, after centrifugation at 3000× g for 5 min to sediment debris, the liquid was collected, measured (on average ≈20 mL), and retained for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from 500 µL of the liquid using the eGene-UP semi-automated system (bioMerieux, Marcyl'Étoile, France) and NucliSENS buffer reagents (bioMerieux) following the manufacturer's instructions. Elution was performed in 100 µL. A negative extraction control sample (molecular grade water) was also tested in parallel with each set of extracted samples.\n"," Nucleic acid extraction from human and animal swabs was performed using an automated nucleic acid platform (Maelstrom 9600, TANBead, Taiwan), with a magnetic bead-based protocol, using an extraction associated kit (TANBeadNucleic Acid Extraction Kit). Following manufacturer's instructions, 300 µL of virus transport medium for the swabs were used for nucleic acids extraction. The RNA was finally eluted in 80 µL of elution buffer in the dedicated plate provided with the kit.\n"," Nucleic acids were stored at −80 • C until testing.\n"," Viral extraction efficiency in sponge samples was assessed using Mengovirus according to ISO 15216-2:2019 [43] . SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed following the Charité-Berlin protocol, both for primers/probes and for thermal profile [44] for the amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 E (Betacoronavirus screening assay), N (nucleocapsid protein) and RdRp (SARS-CoV-2 confirmatory assay) genes (Table 2) . Amplification reactions were prepared with the RNA UltraSense One-Step qRT-PCR System (Invitrogen; Waltham, MA, USA) and presence of PCR inhibitors was ruled out using TaqMan Exogenous Internal Positive Control (applied Biosystems; Waltham, MA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Results were considered acceptable if a minimum recovery of 1% was achieved and no significant inhibition was detected in the amplifications. SARS-CoV-2 detection in human and animal swabs was performed using the Allplex 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR assay (Seegene, South Korea) which also targets the E gene of Sarbecovirus, and the RdRp and N genes of SARS-CoV-2. An internal control (MS2 phage genome), provided with the kit, was used to monitor the process. Amplification and detection were performed on Bio-Rad CFX96 platform (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and results were interpreted according to the manufacturer instructions as follows: a sample was considered (I) positive if the three target genes displayed Ct values < 38, (II) presumptive positive if one or two genes were amplified with Ct values >38, (III) negative, if no amplification was detected for any of the three targets or if the three genes displayed Ct values ≥38.\n"," Droplet digital RT-PCR was performed on Bio-Rad's QX200 system (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using the primers/probes of the Charité-Berlin protocol [18] . Two probes were used to amplify the RdRp gene at the same time: RdRP_SARSr-P1to detect SARS-CoV-2 and bat-SARS-related CoVs and RdRp_SARSr-P2 for specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. The reaction mixture (20 µL of total volume) consisted of: 5 µL One-step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probes, 2 µL Reverse transcriptase, 1 µL 300 mM DTT, 5 µL of samples RNA, primers and probes in the concentrations detailed in Table 2 and nuclease-free water as requied. Droplet generation was then performed as recommended by the manufacturer, and amplification was carried out on a CFX96 DeepWell instrument (Bio-Rad) with the following thermal profile: 50 • C for 60 min, 95 • C for 10 min followed by 95 • C for 15 s and 60 • C for 45 s (45 cycles) and by a final stage at 98 • C for 10 min. After amplification, results were acquired using the Bio-Rad QX200 Droplet Reader and QuantaSoft software (v1.7) (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to count the PCR-positive or PCR-negative droplets and to provide absolute quantification of the target sequence. For each target gene, results of dd RT-PCR were used to calculate positivity rate (number of samples with SARS-CoV-2 detection on tested samples) for the different environments considered in the study, and average SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and range in positive samples. Detection rates in the different types of environments (animal farms, public transportation, supermarkets) were compared with the chi-squared test.\n"," In the present study, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in public (transportation, supermarket, hotel) and working environments (animal farms) associated with reported COVID-19 cases in different areas of the Campania region. In animal farms, human and animal naso/oropharyngeal swabs were also taken. None of the naso/oropharyngeal swabs from humans (n = 93) and animals (n = 246) showed the presence of any of the three genetic markers (RdRp, E and N gene) of SARS-CoV-2. With regard to environmental samples (sponges), SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time RT-PCR was also negative for all targets, in all samples (data not shown). On the contrary, dd RT-PCR achieved the detection of traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in several samples (Table 3) . Considering the three genetic targets (RdRp, gene E, gene N) together, 20/77 samples (26%) displayed the presence of at least one marker. In detail, RdRp gene sequences were detected in 17/77 samples (22%, concentration range 0.14-3.30 genome copies (g.c.)/µL of RNA), gene E in 8/77 (10%, concentration range 0.15-0.90 g.c./µL) and gene N in 1/77 (1%, concentration 0.18 g.c./µL). These results corresponded to estimated concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 of 31.2 g.c./cm 2 , range 5.6 to 132 g.c./cm 2 considering RdRp, 15.1 g.c./cm 2 , range 6 to 36 g.c./cm 2 using gene E, and 7.2 g.c./cm 2 considering gene N (data not shown).\n"," SARS-CoV-2 detection was more frequent in samples from animal farms (11/34 = 32% positive samples; positivity rate of 29%, 15% and 0% for RdRp, gene E and gene N, respectively) and in public transportation buses (6/20 = 30% positive samples; 30% RdRp, 10% gene E and 0% gene N), while each of the three SARS-CoV-2 targets were detected only in 1 of the 14 samples from supermarket (positivity rate of 7%). In these samples, however, a higher divergence of results was found, as the three targets were never detected in association but in three distinct samples. The differences in the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in animal farms, public transportation, and supermarkets were not statistically significant (chi-squared p-value = 0.75).\n"," Also, virus concentration was higher in samples collected from animal farms compared to other sampling locations, RdRp average value being 1.00 g.c./µL of RNA (equivalent to 40 g.c./cm 2 , range 5.6 to 132) vs. 0.51 g.c./µL of RNA (equivalent to 20.4 g.c./cm 2 , range 7.2 to 40) of samples from public buses. Finally, none of the nine samples collected from the receptive structure of the hotel was found to harbor genetic traces of SARS-CoV-2.\n"," The SARS-CoV-2can survive in the air and on surfaces for several hours and up to several days, depending on environmental conditions [45] , but being infected following contact with contaminated surfaces seems to be a remote risk [46] . Despite this, public health agencies underline that surfaces may pose a risk for virus transmission and should be disinfected frequently, prioritizing efforts to prevent the spread of the virus [47] . The objective of our study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 contamination in selected public and working environments, using the sponge method for surface sampling and droplet digital PCR for detection [48, 49] . To date, indeed, several studies have assessed SARS-CoV-2 contamination in hospital or healthcare settings, but still few have addressed the risk of surface contamination in public-or work-places [38] . Environmental sampling is a critical component of verification of the effectiveness of sanitation processes and, in order to detect the presence of viruses that may be present in traces on the investigated surfaces, the use of efficient sampling systems is a compelling requirement [50] . The sponge sampling method allows a more vigorous scrubbing of the surfaces, an extensive adhesion of the sampler to the surface (also on objects with uneven shapes or with crevices), and an increased adsorption of detached materials. Over time, swabs with higher recovery performance towards viruses on surfaces [51] have been developed, through adaptation of shape and materials, and have also been successfully used for SARS-CoV-2 sampling from plastic objects such as glasses, cups and bottles that may come into contact with infected individuals [52] . However, in the context of official controls performed by the local health authorities, it has long been demonstrated that swabs have a capture capacity not exceeding~20% of the target on the surface, therefore the sponge sampling confirms its functionality because of the higher recovery efficiency [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . Further to an effective sampling strategy, high sensitivity should also be provided by the molecular analytical methods used for testing of environmental samples. The current gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on the real-time RT-PCR assay but has several downsides [59] . Falsenegative real-time RT-PCR assay results can arise because of insufficient viral material in samples, while weak positive results (i.e., high Ct values) can be difficult to interpret and to differentiate from technical artifacts (e.g., fluorescence increase due to sample background or probe degradation) [44] . For this reason, in recent years, droplet digital RT-PCR (dd RT-PCR) has been considered a good alternative to real time RT-PCR assays, considering its high sensitivity in the detection and quantification of RNA targets [60, 61] and its ability to provide consistent and reliable results also at low target concentrations [62] . Moreover, using Poisson's distribution, the absolute concentration of the target can be calculated without the use of standard curves [63] and, due to sample partitioning, reactions are less affected by the presence of inhibitors [64] . Therefore, in this study, sponge sampling was coupled with real time RT-PCR as well as with dd RT-PCR, which, in the end, was the only analytical approach providing positive results. Our investigation showed traces of SARS-CoV-2 in 26% of the surface samples collected from the different environments considered in the study (animal farms, public transportation buses, supermarkets, hotel receptive structures), some of which interested from previous outbreak events. Overall, considering the results of the RdRp gene as a reference, SARS-CoV-2concentration in the positive samples was of 31.2 g.c./cm 2 (range 5.6 to 132 g.c./cm 2 ). Quantitative data on SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces are scarce and are almost exclusively related to high risk closed environments used for COVID-19 patients [29] , therefore direct comparison of our results, which derive from different environments, with other studies is not feasible. With regard to sampling performed on public transportation buses, positive results (always considering the RdRp gene as a reference) were obtained in 30% of samples, with an average concentration of 40 g.c./cm 2 (range 5.6 to 132g.c./cm 2 ). These results are intermediate to those stated by studies from other countries [37, 38] and only slightly higher than those reported for the period May-June 2021 in another Italian region, Apulia, in which SARS-CoV-2 was overall detected on 10.7% of the tested surfaces and, more specifically, in 19.3% of bus surfaces and 2% of train surfaces [42] . It should be noted, however, that the different prevalence might also be related to the different sampling techniques (swabs vs. sponges), which-as stated before-might affect viral recovery from surfaces. Interestingly, the viral concentrations achieved in the present study seem significantly higher than those reported in one [38] of the few other studies including quantitative data. Indeed, in the study by Moreno and colleagues (2021) [38] on public transportation in Barcelona, depending on the target sequence (IP2, IP4, gene E), SARS-CoV-2 contamination ranged from 5 to 490 c.g./m 2 in public buses and from 18 to 714 c.g./m 2 in the subway, i.e., approximately 4 log lower than in our study. This significant divergence in quantitative results, however, should be considered in the light of both the deep difference in the analytical methods (sampling techniques, molecular targets, real-time PCR vs. dd RT-PCR, standards for calibrations, etc.) and the different epidemiological situations registered during the two studies (May-June 2020 for the study in Barcelona, March 2021 for the current study). Considering the samples taken from the supermarket, a certain variability of results was observed, as overall 3 samples of 14 (21%) showed traced of SARS-CoV-2 genome. These results are higher than those reported by Caggiano and colleagues [40] for supermarkets tested in Apulia, Italy in April-May 2021 (4.3%) or by Singh et al. [65] in Ontario, Canada during October-November 2020 (no detection of SARS-CoV-2). However, the three studies differ under several aspects, including different sampling techniques (swab vs. sponges), molecular detection (real-time vs. dd RT-PCR), as well for the fact that only this study targets multiple genome regions of SARS-CoV-2, hence increasing the chance of detection. It should also be noted that the three positive results of the present study were all associated only with one genetic target (none of the three tested genes were ever detected simultaneously). This could be due to high viral degradation, possibly in relation to the stricter cleaning and sanitation procedures applied in food stores. Indeed, while detection of SARS-CoV-2 is a clear indication of a contamination event, little can be said on viral infectivity particularly if detection is related to surfaces periodically subjected to disinfection.\n"," Effectiveness of cleaning and sanitation procedures (for the deactivation of SARS-CoV-2 as well as for removal of any residual inactivated virus particle), together with the natural decay of viruses on surfaces, may also explain the results obtained in the samples collected from the hotel receptive structure, which was sampled due to its association with a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak event following a wedding party. Indeed, in this case sampling was performed one week after the event and after extensive sanitation. Sampling of receptive structures in a different context (e.g., under routine use of the environments and with standard cleaning activities) may indeed lead to SARS-CoV-2 detection also in such environments, as demonstrated by Montagna and colleagues (2021) [41] , that found traces of the viral genome in 6% of the tested surfaces. Finally, with regard to the samples taken in animal farms (buffaloes, cattle, pigs, goats, horses, rabbits, hens and pigeons), 32% of surface samples were found positive for at least one genetic target of SARS-CoV-2. With the exception of studies dealing with mink farms, in which SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces was investigated due to the outbreaks associated with the CoV-2 mink-specific variant [66, 67] , the present study is, to our knowledge, the first one dealing with environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in animal farms. Significantly, the absence of SARS-CoV-2 detection in the workers and in the animals at the moment of testing (no detection in 339 swabs) confirms that the 11 positive surface samples were related to previous infection events, during which the virus had been deposited on work surfaces, walls and utensils. Further to this, higher viral concentrations were found in samples taken from animal farms (40 g.c./cm 2 vs. 20.4 g.c./cm 2 of public transportation, with a range significantly more extended, 5.6-132 vs. 7. . This is in agreement with the fact that cleaning and sanitation procedures are less feasible in animal husbandry, and therefore removal of viruses deposited on surfaces is more difficult. One of these, buffaloes farm n • 4, provided three positive samples (two of which from the milking parlor surfaces) and had registered two COVID-19 fatalities among workers in the two months preceding our sampling. The other two farms, buffaloes farm n • 2 and n • 3, also regularly visited by one of these workers, showed instead no traces of SARS-CoV-2 on the tested surfaces, hence displaying a certain variability of viral deposition on surfaces, depending on the environment.\n"," Data obtained suggests that the risk of contamination increases in environments with a higher presence of people and where decontamination strategies are not always feasible. At the same time our observations also suggest that improving the quality of the environmental sanitation can reduce the spreading of the pathogen. Comparing data on human swabs and on surface sponges, it has been previously shown that, after disinfection, several environments, even those affected by proven human contamination, do not present traces of SARS-CoV-2, which instead are revealed in different surfaces collected from environments not thoroughly sanitized [68] . A rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation is possible by using commonly available chemicals and biocides on inanimate surfaces (e.g., EtOH 70% or sodium hypochlorite) [69] . Further to this, this study showed the reliability of dd RT-PCR method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 traces on surfaces. Further studies are required to improve and standardize surface-sampling methods for viral analysis, to estimate viral infectivity on surfaces, and to assess the risk of viral transmission, thereby providing additional information on the relevance of SARS-CoV-2 contamination of fomites. \n"," The data presented in this study are available on request from the corresponding author.\n"," The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n","Score: 6.404187537277172\n","\n","Title: Glial Cells Suppress Postencephalitic CD8 1 T Lymphocytes Through PD-L1\n","Body Text: T he immune response against central nervous system (CNS) infection requires a delicate balance between efficient pathogen clearance and the preservation of sensitive, nonrenewable neural cells. It is becoming evident that following CNS insult and acute inflammation, the brain does not return to its preinfection state; animal models of neurodegenerative disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and brain infection each show prolonged activation of resident microglia and sustained presence of memory T-cells. Overactive and persistent immune activation within the brain can be detrimental to sensitive neuronal cells resulting in focal neuropathology and, correspondingly, memory deficits (Armien et al., 2010) .\n"," Thus, suppression of persistent brain inflammation is critical to limiting bystander tissue damage and preserving neurological function.\n"," Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and have been traditionally thought to be proinflammatory. Recent studies, however, suggest they play additional roles as immune regulators. Microglia limit CNS pathology by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine production from brain-infiltrating T-cells through activation of the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1): programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) pathway. PD-L1 (CD274, B7-H1), a co-inhibitory molecule expressed on antigen presenting cells, which plays a crucial role in the functional suppression of T-cell responses (Latchman et al., 2004) .\n"," Engagement of PD-1 on activated CD4 1 and CD8 1 T-cells by PD-L1 has been shown as a mechanism for suppression of T-cell function, commonly referred to as T-cell exhaustion. In the absence of PD-L1 (PD-L1 2/2 mice), coronavirus infection of the brain resulted in a heightened inflammatory response, ultimately leading to the more rapid clearance of virus from the CNS (Phares et al., 2013) . This comes at a cost however, PD-L1 2/2 mice exhibited quicker onset of clinical symptoms and a higher rate of mortality, demonstrating the importance of this pathway in negatively regulating neuroinflammation in the brain. PD-L1 expression on microglia, as well as on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, has been shown to decrease T-cell activation in models of multiple sclerosis, as well as during acute viral encephalitis (Duncan and Miller, 2011; Magnus et al., 2005; Phares et al., 2009 ). However, little is known about the immunoregulatory role of microglia during chronic, persistent neuroinflammation in animals that recover from viral brain infection.\n"," Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) brain infection is the most significant cause of neurological disorders related to intrauterine infection in humans and is also a major cause of encephalitis during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Cheeran et al., 2009a) . Using a mouse model of murine (M) CMV infection, we have previously shown that, in the aftermath of a nonlethal acute viral infection, the CNS is maintained in a state of chronic neuroinflammation. Sustained immune activation within the brain is a key feature of herpesvirus pathogenicity (Armien et al., 2010) , along with the establishment of latency after clearance of acute infection and the potential for virus reactivation (Fields, 2007) . Prolonged immune responses within the brain following MCMV infection are characterized by persistence of antibody-producing B-cells, chronic microglial cell activation, and retention of MCMV-specific effector-memory CD8 1 T-cells (Mutnal et al., 2011b; Mutnal et al., 2012) . Although CD8 1 T-cells play an important role in controlling acute brain infection (Reddehase et al., 1987 (Reddehase et al., , 1985 , the chronic presence of these IFN-g-producing T-cells may be damaging to the brain. Although retention of antigen-specific CD8 1 T-cells following MCMV infection helps to protect against virus reactivation, they are also responsible for long-term activation of microglia throughout the brain (Mutnal et al., 2011b) . Cytotoxic CD8 T-lymphocytes have been shown responsible for the destruction of healthy bystander neurons in the retina (McPherson et al., 2006) . Thus, maintaining CD8 1 T-cells in a functionally suppressed state in the brain may enable both adequate neuroprotection from subsequent infection or reactivation, while also limiting unnecessary bystander neurotoxicity.\n"," In this study, we investigated the role of glial cells in the functional inhibition of persistent CD8 1 T-cells in the postencephalitic brain following MCMV infection. Specifically, we show that PD-L1, expressed on microglia during chronic neuroinflammation, contributes to the suppression of antiviral CD8 1 T-cell activity. Our data also demonstrate that astrocytes control CD8 1 T-cytokine production through the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway.\n"," This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: 1105A99494) of the University of Minnesota. All surgery was performed under Ketamine anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.\n"," RM461, a MCMV expressing Escherichia coli b-galactosidase under the control of the human ie1/ie2 promoter/enhancer (Stoddart et al., 1994) was kindly provided by Edward S. Mocarski. The virus was maintained by passage in weanling female Balb/c mice. Salivary gland-passed virus was then grown in NIH 3T3 cells for two passages, which minimized any carry over of salivary gland tissue. Infected 3T3 cultures were harvested at 80-100% cytopathic effect and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (1,000g) at 4 C, and the virus was pelleted through a 35% sucrose cushion (in Tris-buffered saline [50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4]) at 23,000g for 2 h at 4 C. The pellet was suspended in Tris-buffered saline containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Viral stock titers were determined on 3T3 cells as 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 ) per milliliter. Six to eight week old Balb/c mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).\n"," Infection of mice with MCMV was performed as previously described (Cheeran et al., 2004) . Briefly, female mice (6-8 week old) were anesthetized using a combination of Ketamine and Xylazine (20 mg and 2 mg/kg body weight, respectively) and immobilized on a small animal stereotactic instrument equipped with a Cunningham mouse adapter (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). The skin and underlying connective tissue were reflected to expose reference sutures (sagittal and coronal) on the skull. The sagittal plane was adjusted such that bregma and lambda were positioned at the same coordinates on the vertical plane. Virulent, salivary gland-passaged MCMV RM461 (1.5 3 10 5 TCID 50 units in 10 mL), was injected into the right lateral ventricle at 0.9 mm lateral, 0.5 mm caudal, and 3.0 mm ventral to bregma using a Hamilton syringe (10 mL) fitted to a 27 G needle. The injection was delivered over a period of 3-5 min. The opening in the skull was sealed with bone wax and the skin was closed using 4-0 silk sutures with a FS-2 needle (Ethicon).\n"," Leukocytes were isolated from control and MCMV-infected murine brains using a previously described procedure with minor modifications (Cheeran et al., 2007; Ford et al., 1995; Havenith et al., 1998; Marten et al., 2003) . In brief, whole brains were harvested, pooled (n 5 4-6 animals/group/experiment), and minced finely in RPMI 1640 (2 g/L D-glucose and 10 mM HEPES) and digested in 0.0625% trypsin (in Ca/Mg-free HBSS) at room temperature for 20 min. Single cell preparations from infected brains were suspended in 30% Percoll and banded on a 70% Percoll cushion at 900 3 g at 15 C. Brain leukocytes obtained from the 30-70% Percoll interface were collected and used for (1) subsequent antibody staining for flow cytometry or (2) suspended in RPMI for ex vivo culture experiments.\n"," For flow cytometric antibody staining, brain leukocytes were first treated with Fc block (anti-CD32/CD16 in the form of 2.4G2 hybridoma culture supernatant with 2% normal rat and 2% normal mouse serum) to inhibit nonspecific Ab binding and were stained with anti-mouse immune cell surface markers for 45 min at 4 C [anti-CD45-PE-Cy5, anti-CD11b-APC-CY7, anti-CD4-e450, anti-CD8-AF700, anti-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II-APC, anti-PD-1-PE, and anti-PD-L1-PE or FITC (eBiosciences)]. Analysis by flow cytometry was performed. Control isotype Abs were used for all fluorochrome combinations to assess nonspecific Ab binding. Live leukocytes were gated using forward scatter and sidescatter parameters on a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar) .\n"," Ex vivo cultures of brain leukocytes isolated from MCMVinfected mice at 14 d postinfection were used to investigate CD8 1 T-cell cytokine production following antibody neutralization of the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway. Total brain leukocytes suspensions were seeded at a density of 1.3 3 10 5 cells/well and cultured at 37 C in RPMI complete supplemented with 10% FCS. Aminoguanidine (1 mM; Sigma) and indomethacin (20 mM; Sigma) were added to media to suppress nitric oxide synthetase and prostaglandin production (Duncan and Miller, 2011) . Cells were treated for 1 h with either anti-PD-L1 neutralizing antibody (10 mg/mL; M1H5 clone; eBioscience) or rat IgG2a isotype control (10 mg/mL; eBioscience) prior to the addition of the CD8 T-cell specific MCMV-IE1 168-176 peptide (YPHFMPTNL; 5 and 50 mM) (Del Val et al., 1988) . Anti-CD3 (2 mg/mL) stimulation was included as a positive control. Supernatants were collected 48 h after peptide addition and frozen at 220 C until analysis.

The medium was replenished 1 and 4 d after plating. On day 12 of culture harvested cells were plated in a 60-mm Petri dish and incubated for 15 min at 37 C. After extensive washing with culture medium, adherent microglia were collected with a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. Purified microglial cell cultures were comprised of a cell population in which >98% stained positively with Iba-1 antibodies and <2% stained positively with antibodies specific to glial fibrillary acid protein, an astrocyte marker. Depending on the experiment, microglia were plated onto either 48-, 24-, or 12-well tissue culture plates (2 3 10 4 , 2 3 10 5 , 1 3 10 6 cells/well, respectively) for RNA extraction and quantitation or for flow cytometric antibody staining.\n"," Purified astrocyte cultures were prepared from microglial cell seed cultures following isolation of microglia (see earlier) at 14 days in vitro. Briefly, after collection of microglia, culture flasks containing the remaining cells were shaken at 180-200 rpm at 37 C for 16 h followed by trypsinization with 0.25% trypsin in HBSS for 30 min. After adding FBS (final concentration 10%), centrifugation and washing, cells were seeded into new flasks with DMEM followed by medium change after 24 h. The subculture procedure was repeated weekly for 2 weeks to remove residual oligodendrocytes and microglia and achieve highly purified astrocyte cultures (95-98% of cells reacted with GFAP antibody). Depending on the experiment, astrocytes were then collected and seeded onto either 48-, 24-, or 12-well tissue culture plates (2 3 10 4 , 2 3 10 5 , 1 3 10 6 cells/well, respectively) for RNA extraction and quantitation or for flow cytometric antibody staining.\n"," CD8: Glial Cell Co-cultures CD8 1 T-cells were isolated using the MagCellect Mouse CD8 1 T Cell Isolation Kit (R&D Systems) from the spleens and lymph nodes of naive Balb/c mice.

CD8 1 T-cells were added at a 10:1 CD8: glial cell ratio. Neutralization of PD-1 and its ligand was performed by treating glial cells with anti-PD-1 (J43 clone; eBiosciences), anti-PD-L1 (M1H5 clone; eBiosciences), anti-PD-L2 (TY25 clone; eBiosciences), or IgG2a for 2 h prior to the addition of anti-CD3-activated CD8 T-cells.

This infection is rapidly cleared through the action of microglia, the resident CNS immune sentinels, and the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells from the periphery. We have previously shown that this acute and controlled viral brain infection results in chronic neuroinflammation that can persist for at least 30 d following viral clearance (Mutnal et al., 2011b) . Isolation and flow cytometry of brain mononuclear cells (BMNCs), including microglia and CNS-infiltrating leukocytes, from MCMVinfected mice showed that microglia upregulate the surrogate activation marker, MHC Class II, during the acute phase of infection and continue to chronically express this protein on their surface (Mutnal et al., 2011b) . MHC Class II expression on microglia is notably absent in sham-, mock-, and uninfected mice. In this study, we first confirmed this widespread and prolonged expression of MHC Class II on microglia using immunohistochemistry. At 30 days postinfection (dpi) in the postencephalitic brains of MCMV-infected mice, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) was found to colocalize with MHC Class II on activated microglia (Fig. 1A) .\n"," Recent studies suggest that antigen presenting cells, such as microglia, can suppress T-cell activation through the PD-1: PD-L1 inhibitory pathway. Microglial suppression of CD4 1 and CD8 1 T-cells has been shown during the active phase of viral infection in murine models of multiple sclerosis (Carter et al., 2007; Magnus et al., 2005; Phares et al., 2013) . It is not known whether similar mechanisms are involved in the inhibition of T-cells persisting within the CNS during chronic neuroinflammation in the absence of active viral replication. Using our MCMV brain infection model, we first examined the kinetics of PD-L1 expression on microglia from the acute, productive phase of infection (7 dpi) into the chronic neuroinflammatory, postviral clearance phase (30 dpi). Resting microglia, which are identified by flow cytometry as the CD45 int CD11b 1 population, in uninfected mice expressed low levels of PD-L1. In contrast, during the acute phase of viral infection PD-L1 surface expression on microglia increased dramatically (control 5 19.7% vs. MCMVinfected 5 90.6%) and remained elevated during persistent neuroinflammation (29.4%; Fig. 1B ). Persistent Brain-Infiltrating CD8 1 T-Cells Express the PD-1 Receptor CD8 1 T-cells are pivotal to the active clearance of virus from the brain during MCMV infection. As previously shown in mouse models of herpesvirus brain infection (Armien et al., 2010; Mutnal et al., 2011b) , we found immunohistological evidence that CD8 1 T-cells persist in the postencephalitic brain following MCMV clearance ( Fig. 2A ). In addition, kinetic analysis of BMNCs for brain infiltrating CD8 1 T-cells (gated on the CD45 1 CD11b low infiltrating T-cell population) from MCMV-infected brain homogenates showed an increase in the percentage of CD8 1 T-cells as the infection progressed from the acute (7 dpi 5 29.9%) to chronic (30 dpi 5 64.5%) phases of disease (Fig. 2B) . In brain tissues obtained from shaminfected, control animals, infiltrating CD45(hi) cells were found to be rare (5.6%; Cheeran et al., 2009b; Mutnal et al., 2010 Mutnal et al., , 2011a .\n"," Antigen experienced CD8 1 T-cells are known to express PD-1 as an indicator of activation and, subsequently, exhaustion (Hofmeyer et al., 2011) . However, the state of PD-1 expression on persistent CD8 1 T-cells in the brain following viral encephalitis is unknown. To investigate the interaction of microglia and CD8 1 T-cells during chronic neuroinflammation, we examined CD8 1 T-cell PD-1 expression kinetics following MCMV brain infection. To this end, BMNCs were isolated from MCMV-infected mice at 7 and 30 dpi. The CD45 1 CD11b low -identified T-cell population was further gated on for analysis of the CD8 1 subpopulation. During the acute phase of infection (7 dpi) PD-1 surface expression on CD8 1 T-cells within the brain was elevated (40.7%). PD-1 expression remained elevated on CD8 1 T-cells during CNS persistence (14 dpi 5 14.7%; 30 dpi 5 8.3%), however, the percentage of PD-1 1 CD8 1 cells decreased compared with levels observed during the acute infection (Fig. 2C) . The CD45 1 CD11b low population of T-cells is notably absent from mock-and uninfected mice (Cheeran et al., 2007) , thus PD-1 expression on CD8 1 T-cells within control mice is not measurable.\n"," Microglia Inhibit CD8 1 T-Cell Activity via the PD-1: PD-L1 Pathway Chronic activation and PD-L1 expression on microglia following MCMV brain infection, along with the retention and long-term PD-1 expression on CD8 1 T-cells, suggests glial cell involvement in the functional suppression of residual Tcells in the postviral encephalitic brain. Using primary microglial cells, we directly examined the inhibitory effects of microglial PD-L1 on CD8 1 T-cell activation. First, we confirmed the activation and upregulation of PD-L1 on cultured microglial in response to IFN-g, TNFa, and IL-1b, proinflammatory cytokines found during acute and chronic infection (Armien et al., 2010; Marques et al., 2008; Mutnal et al., 2011b) . IFN-g, TNFa, or IL-1b stimulation for 24 h resulted in a four-fold increase in PD-L1 mRNA expression in microglia, compared with unstimulated controls (Fig. 3A) . Similarly, 24 h incubation with IFN-g, a potent T-cellsecreted cytokine, resulted in a robust increase of surfaceexpressed PD-L1 on microglia (control 5 8.6%; IFNg 5 92.9%; Fig. 3B ). These data confirmed previous reports that resting microglia express low levels of PD-L1 (Magnus et al., 2005) . As a positive control for microglial activation, we found that IFN-g-treatment induced microglial expression of MHC Class II (control 5 18.0%; IFN-g 5 81.7%; Fig. 3C ). Both constitutive and IFN-g-induced MHC Class I expression were also detected (control 5 44.1%; IFNg 5 74.5%; Fig. 3D ).\n"," To examine microglial inhibition of CD8 1 T-cell activation through PD-L1, we co-cultured CD8 1 cells with IFN-gstimulated primary microglia. Microglia were pretreated with IFN-g for 8 h before being co-cultured with either unstimulated CD8 1 T-cells, which express little PD-1 (11%), or with CD8 1 T-cells stimulated to express PD-1 (30.5%) via anti-CD3 antibody pretreatment (48 h; Fig. 4A ). Co-culture of unstimulated CD8 1 T-cells with microglia produced negligible levels of IFN-g and IL-2 in the culture supernatant (Fig.  4B,C) . As expected, anti-CD3-stimulated CD8 1 T-cells in co-culture with microglia presented a significant increase in IFN-g (P < 0.001) and IL-2 (P < 0.001) production. Blockade of PD-L1 on microglia using an anti-PD-L1 neutralizing antibody enhanced CD8 1 T-cell IFN-g (P 5 0.0024) and IL-2 production. Similarly, blockade of PD-1 on CD8 1 T-cells with anti-PD-1 neutralizing antibody enhanced IFN-g (anti-PD-1, P 5 0.0187) and IL-2 production. In contrast, neither anti-PD-L2 neutralizing antibody nor control IgG significantly affected CD8 1 T-cell IFN-g and IL-2 levels in the supernatant.\n"," Previous studies in mouse models of multiple sclerosis have shown that microglia and infiltrating macrophages inhibit immune activation via PD-L1 interaction with PD-1 on CD8 1 T-cells (Duncan and Miller, 2011; Phares et al., 2013) . These studies, however, concentrate on the role of the PD-1: PD-L1 interaction in limiting T-cell activation using a demyelinating disease model caused by an active viral infection. In this study, we focused on the function of glialexpressed PD-L1 in the persistently inflamed CNS of MCMV-infected mice (>14 dpi); this is long past the acute, virally active phase of disease, which is complete by 7 dpi. The role of microglial PD-L1 expression in suppressing chronic postencephalitic neuroinflammation is unknown.\n"," To test the functional role of PD-L1 expression in the brain of postencephalitic mice, we first isolated BMNCs from MCMV-infected mice at 14 dpi, a time point void of active viral replication and associated with the transition into chronic neuroinflammation, and placed them into ex vivo cultures. Total BMNCs, which include CD4 1 T-cells, CD8 1 Tcells and microglia, were incubated with MCMV IE1 168-176 (0, 5, and 50 mM), which has previously been identified as a CD8 1 T-cell-specific MHC Class I restricted epitope (Del Val et al., 1988; Holtappels et al., 2002) , for 48 h and supernatants were analyzed for IFN-g and IL-2 via ELISA. MCMV IE1 168-176 stimulation alone resulted in a dose-dependent increase in CD8 1 T-cell IFN-g and IL-2 production (Fig. 5A,B) . Using PD-L1 neutralizing antibody, added 1 h prior to MCMV IE1 168-176 stimulation, we were able to specifically assess the role of PD-L1 on CD8 1 T-cell IFN-g production. In the presence of anti-PD-L1 antibody, IFN-g and IL-2 increased dramatically, compared with untreated and IgG2a-treated control; IFN-g production in the presence of anti-PD-L1 antibody increased 72% (50 mM IE1) and 250% (5 mM IE1). Similarly, IL-2 production increased 20% (50 mM IE1) and 120% (5 mM IE1) above untreated and IgG2a-treated controls.\n"," Astrocytes Inhibit CD8 1 T-Cell Activity via the PD-1: PD-L1 Pathway Astrocytes were the first glial cells shown to be inducible for MHC Class II expression (Lipp et al., 2007; Shrikant and Benveniste, 1996) . In comparison to microglia, astrocyte MHC Class II expression is slower to develop and less robust, thus deeming them the \"nonprofessional\" antigen presenting cells in the brain (Vardjan et al., 2012) . Little is known about the antigen presenting capacity of astrocytes in our model of MCMV-induced encephalitis. In this study, we first examined MCMV-infected brain tissue and confirmed MHC Class II colocalization with GFAP-labeled astrocytes in postencephalitic (30 dpi) mice (Fig. 6A) . Chronic astrocyte activation, as indicated by MHC Class II expression, a known marker for glial cell activation, suggests a role for these cells during postencephalitic neuroinflammation, like that observed for microglia. Indeed, when in co-culture with T-cells, astrocytes have been shown to suppress T-cell activation by IFN-g (Gold et al., 1996) . However, the mechanisms by which astrocytes suppress T-cells are currently unknown.\n"," Using purified murine astrocyte cultures, we investigated the effects of the T-cell produced proinflammatory cytokine IFN-g on astrocyte activation and PD-L1 expression. Unstimulated and IFN-g-stimulated astrocytes can be extracted from culture plates via light trypsinization (0.5% Trypsin in HBSS) for 15 min and identified by flow cytometry using forward- and side-scatter (Fig. 6B) . Flow cytometry confirmed that, like microglia, IFN-g stimulation (24 h) resulted in the robust activation of astrocytes as indicated by MHC Class II (Fig. 6C) and PD-L1 surface protein expression (Fig. 6D ). In addition, semiquantitative RT-PCR of IFN-g-stimulated astrocytes in vitro also showed an increase in PD-L1 mRNA expression compared with unstimulated control cells (Fig. 6E) . Surface expression of MHC Class I was also detected on unstimulated and IFN-g-stimulated (24 h) astrocytes (Fig. 6F) .\n"," Based on our finding that microglial expressed PD-L1 inhibited CD8 1 T-cell activation in the postencephalitic, chronically inflamed brain, we hypothesized that IFN-gactivated murine astrocytes would also possess the ability to suppress CD8 1 T-cell function via interaction through PD-1 and PD-L1. To this end, we co-cultured unstimulated or anti-CD3-stimulated CD8 1 T-cells with purified murine astrocytes. Astrocytes were stimulated with IFN-g for 24 h before being co-cultured with the CD8 1 T-cells. Co-cultures of unstimulated CD8 1 T-cells with astrocytes produced negligible levels of IFN-g and IL-2 in the culture supernatant (Fig. 7A,B) . As expected, anti-CD3-stimulated CD8 1 T-cells resulted in a significant increase in IFN-g (P < 0.001) and FIGURE 4: Microglia suppress activated CD8 1 T-cells through PD-1: PD-L1. (A) CD8 1 T-cells from uninfected Balb/c mice were placed into culture (2 3 10 5 cells/well) wells coated with a-CD3 Abs (2 mg/mL). Cells were collected and analyzed at 0, 24, and 48 h for PD-1 receptor surface expression. Isotype 5 filled gray line. (B, C) Unstimulated CD8 T-cells (untreated) or CD3-stimulated CD8 1 T-cells were transferred into co-culture with microglia that received an IFN-c (200 Units/mL) pretreatment for 8 h. CD8 1 T-cells were added at a 10:1 CD8: Glial cell ratio. Prior to CD8 1 T-cell addition, co-cultures were left untreated (control) or treated for 2 h with a-PD-L1, a-PD-L2, or a-PD-1 neutralizing antibody. Treatment with rat IgG2a was used as an isotype antibody control. Supernatants were collected at 24 h and ELISA run for IFN-c (B) and IL-2 (C). Histograms are representative of three separate experiments. *P 0.01. **P 0.001. IL-2 (P < 0.001). Blockade of PD-L1 on astrocytes using an anti-PD-L1 neutralizing antibody enhanced CD8 1 T-cell IFN-g (P < 0.001) and IL-2 (P 5 0.003) production. Similarly, blockade of PD-1 on CD8 1 T-cells with anti-PD-1 neutralizing antibody enhanced IFN-g (P < 0.001) and IL-2 (P 5 0.0016) production compared with unstimulated cocultures and cultures treated with IgG antibody. Similar to microglia, anti-PD-L2 neutralizing antibody did not affect CD8 1 T-cell production of IFN-g and IL-2 when in coculture with astrocytes.\n"," Long term, persistent inflammation of the CNS is commonly seen during neurodegenerative disease, stroke, and viral brain infection (Neumann, 2001) . Observations in animal models of brain infection and disease show that chronic neuroinflammation typically consists of the retention of CD8 1 T-cells and heightened activation of MHC Class II on resident microglia. A similar profile for chronic brain inflammation is reported in this study, where immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry show that approximately 30% of microglia continue to express the surrogate marker for glial cell activation, MHC Class II, at 30 dpi (Fig. 1) , long past clearance of active viral replication in the brain. We also confirmed previous findings that, as MCMV brain infection progressed from the productive phase into the chronic persistent phase, the percent of CD8 1 T-cells within the CD45 1 CD11b low leukocyte population increased from 30% (7 dpi) to 65% (30 dpi; Fig. 2 ), making CD8 1 T-cells the predominant braininfiltrating immune cell type following viral encephalitis. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this study is the first to report the upregulation and maintained expression of MHC Class II on astrocytes during MCMV-infection (Fig. 6) .\n"," CD8 1 T-cells that remain following MCMV brain infection are, at least partially, antigen-specific. IFN-g secretion by these cells is responsible for long-term microglial activation and TNFa production (Mutnal et al., 2011b) . Synergistic action of TNFa and IFN-g in the brain has been shown to increase nitric oxide-induced neurodegeneration (Blais and Rivest, 2004) , emphasizing the importance of minimizing chronic neuroinflammation. If not carefully managed, extended inflammation in the brain can lead to secondary neuronal injury and resultant neurocognitive dysfunction (Armien et al., 2010) .\n"," Microglia, traditionally thought to provide CNS immune surveillance and proinflammatory support, are now also believed to have a role in negatively regulating active Tcell responses in the brain. PD-1 binding with the negative co-stimulatory molecule PD-L1, which is upregulated on antigen presenting cells, is a well-known mechanism for suppression of CD8 1 T-cell proliferation and function (Dong et al., 1999; Kobata et al., 2000; Sharpe and Freeman, 2002) . Microglia are the foremost antigen presenting cells of the brain, as evidenced through their expression of MHC Class I and II in response to brain infection (Neumann, 2001; Sedgwick et al., 1993) . As previously reported (Magnus et al., 2005) , we found low basal expression of PD-L1 on microglia, approximately 20% of cells in uninfected mice expressed surface PD-L1 (Fig. 1) . PD-L1 expression on microglia increased robustly during the acute stage of infection, coinciding with the infiltration of IFN-g-secreting CD8 1 T-cells and increased CNS TNFa (Cheeran et al., 2007) . Similarly, IFN-g and TNFa treatment increased PD-L1 on in vitro cultured microglia, confirming the role of those cytokines in PD-L1 upregulation (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, we found that blockade of the PD-1 pathway with either PD-1 or PD-L1 neutralizing antibody, both in vitro and in ex vivo brain leukocyte extracts, resulted in increased CD8 1 T-cell IFN-g and IL-2 production. These data demonstrate that microglia suppress CD8 1 T-cell function, as indicated by IFN-g and IL-2 production, through the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway.\n"," In this study, MHC Class II expression on microglia and astroglia was used only as an indicator of glial cell activation in response to proinflammatory stimulation. With respect to glial-cell suppression of CD8 1 T-cells, MHC Class I expression is the critical component, not MHC Class II. To demonstrate this, in Fig. 5 , we assessed the effects of glialexpressed PD-L1 on CD8 1 T-cells isolated from the brains of MCMV-infected mice at 14 dpi. In this experiment, we used a MHC Class I restricted peptide for specific CD8 1 Tcell restimulation (MCMV IE1 168-176 ). We, and others, have previously shown this peptide to robustly activate CD8 1 Tcell ex vivo, as indicated by IFN-g stimulation (Del Val et al., 1988; Holtappels et al., 2002; Mutnal et al., 2012) .\n"," Using the JHM strain of neurotropic coronavirus, which induces acute encephalomyelitis in mice, Phares et al. demonstrated that PD-L1 expression on microglia and oligodendroglia during active viral infection facilitated the suppression of CD8 T-cell function (Phares et al., 2009) . Similarly, Duncan et al. showed that microglia in the CNS during active Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, which is used as a model for multiple sclerosis, upregulate PD-L1. Using neutralizing antibody to PD-L1, they showed that ex vivo microglia suppressed CD4 1 and CD8 1 T-cell cytokine production through engagement of the T-cell PD-1 receptor. In vivo blockade of PD-L1, again using neutralizing antibody, resulted in decreased viral loads, but also caused an increase in mortality, presumably through exacerbated immune-mediated damage to the nervous system (Duncan and Miller, 2011) . Although these previous studies have primarily focused on PD-L1 in managing T-cell function during acute viral CNS infection, the present study shows the involvement of this negative regulatory pathway in inhibiting persistent CD8 1 T-cell function during postviral encephalitic chronic neuroinflammation. Specifically, treatment of isolated BMNCs, consisting of microglia and brain-infiltrating leukocytes, with PD-L1 neutralizing antibody increased the production of IFN-g and IL-2 from MCMV-IE1 168-176stimulated memory CD8 1 T-cells (Fig. 5) . These experiments were performed on cells extracted from MCMV-infected brains at 14 dpi, approximately 1 week following the clearance of active viral infection. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment demonstrating the role of microglial PD-L1 on inhibiting brain CD8 1 T-cells during chronic neuroinflammation and in the absence of productive viral infection.\n"," The role of astrocytes acting as antigen presenting cells is well reported (Shrikant and Benveniste, 1996) . In this study, we corroborate previous findings that IFN-g robustly upregulates MHC Class II expression on purified cultures of murine astrocytes. In addition, we report that IFN-g stimulation-induced PD-L1 upregulation on purified astrocytes in vitro, suggesting the involvement of astrocytes as an additional immunosuppressive cell type. Indeed, Pittet et al. have previously shown that IFN-g stimulation of purified cultures of human astrocytes-induced surface PD-L1 expression, which suppress T-lymphocytes via engagement of PD-1 on the FIGURE 7: Astrocytes inhibit CD8 1 T-cell cytokine production through PD-1: PDL-1. (A, B) CD8 1 T-cells were either untouched (untreated) or stimulated with anti-CD3 Abs for 1 h prior to transfer into co-culture with purified astrocytes (anti-CD3 stimulated CD8 cells). Astrocyte cultures were pretreated for 8 h with IFN-c (200 U/mL) to stimulated PD-L1 expression. CD8 1 T-cells were added at a 10:1 CD8: Glial cell ratio. Prior to CD8 1 T-cell addition, astrocyte cultures were left untreated (control) or treated for 2 h with a-PD-L1, a-PD-L2, or a-PD-1 neutralizing antibody. Treatment with rat IgG2a was used as an isotype antibody control. Supernatants were collected at 24 h and ELISA run for IFN-c (A) and IL-2 (B). Histograms are representative of three separate experiments. *P 0.01, **P 0.001. surface of CD8 cells (Pittet et al., 2011) . Furthermore, we confirmed that astrocytes regulate T-cells by inhibiting CD8 1 T-cell cytokine production through the physical engagement of T-cell-expressed PD-1 and glial-expressed PD-L1 (Gold et al., 1996) . As techniques for isolating and culturing astrocytes from the brains of adult mice become available, ex vivo verification of T-cell suppression by astrocytes by this pathway will be required. Multiple studies have clearly shown that, in relation to effector T-cell stimulation, microglia are superior to astrocytes. IFNg induces microglia expression of T-cell costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) that are necessary second-signals for glia to functionally activate T-cells (Aloisi, 2001) . To our knowledge, there have been no reports of astrocytes either expressing these co-stimulatory molecules or being able to effectively activate T-cells (Cross and Ku, 2000) . Studies by Magnus et al., suggest that while astrocytes and microglia both inhibit T-cell function, the effect is more pronounced in the latter cell type (Magnus et al., 2005) . Our in vitro studies show that PD-L1 neutralization resulted in more potent recovery of CD8 1 T-cell IFN-g production in astrocyte co-cultures (2.4-fold increase) compared with microglia co-cultures (1.5-fold). PD-L1 neutralization had comparable effects on IL-2 production in both microglia and astrocyte co-cultures. These data suggest a more potent role for astrocytes in CD8 1 T-cell suppression in the brain. Such conclusions, however, cannot be drawn from the experiments conducted in this study because of our inability to assess the percentage of PD-L1 expression on astrocytes in the postencephalitic brain or to evaluate the effect of PD-L1 neutralization on astrocytes using ex vivo glial: BMNC co-cultures.\n"," Although reports of chronic neuroinflammation are becoming more common, the role for persistent immune activation remains elusive. Within the context of viral encephalitis, studies have shown that persistent microglial activation as well as CD4 1 and CD8 1 T-cell infiltration is associated with neurotoxicity and neurocognitive dysfunction, suggesting extended neuroinflammation may be harmful to the brain (Armien et al., 2010) . Conversely, maintaining an antigen-specific CD8 1 Tcell population in the brain would aide in the rapid clearance of reactivated virus from latently infected neurons (Mutnal et al., 2012; Tsutsui et al., 1995) . Regardless of their purpose, this article shows that brain cells actively contribute to the suppression of CD8 1 T-cells and suggests that a new homeostatic environment is created in the

community outbreak identified by genomic analysis\n","Abstract: Detailed information on the source, spread and evolution of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during seasonal community outbreaks remains sparse. Molecular analyses of attachment (G) gene sequences from hospitalized cases suggest that multiple genotypes and variants co-circulate during epidemics and that RSV persistence over successive seasons is characterized by replacement and multiple new introductions of variants. No studies have defined the patterns of introduction, spread and evolution of RSV at the local community and household level. We present a whole genome sequence analysis of 131 RSV group A viruses collected during 6-month household-based RSV infection surveillance in Coastal Kenya, 2010 within an area of 12 km 2 . RSV infections were identified by regular symptom-independent screening of all household members twice weekly. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RSV A viruses in nine households were closely related to genotype GA2 and fell within a single branch of the global phylogeny. Genomic analysis allowed the detection of householdspecific variation in seven households. For comparison, using only G gene analysis, household-specific variation was found only in one of the nine households. Nucleotide changes were observed both intra-host (viruses identified from same individual in follow-up sampling) and inter-host (viruses identified from different household members) and these coupled with sampling dates enabled a partial reconstruction of the within household transmission chains. The genomic evolutionary rate for the household dataset was estimated as 2.307 Â 10 À 3 (95% highest posterior density: 0.935-4.165Â 10 À 3 ) substitutions/site/year. We conclude that (i) at the household level, most RSV infections arise from the introduction of a single virus variant followed by accumulation of household specific variation and (ii) analysis of complete virus genomes is crucial to better understand viral transmission in the community. A key question arising is whether prevention of RSV introduction or spread within the household by vaccinating key transmitting household members would lead to a reduced onward community-wide transmission.\n","Score: 11.424818957349595\n","\n","Title: Simple mathematical models for controlling COVID-19 transmission through social distancing and community awareness\n","Abstract: The novel COVID-19 pandemic is a current, major global health threat. Up till now, there is no fully approved pharmacological treatment or a vaccine. In this study, simple mathematical models were employed to examine the dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19 taking into consideration social distancing and community awareness. Both situations of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous population were considered. Based on the calculations, a sufficient degree of social distancing based on its reproductive ratio is found to be effective in controlling COVID-19, even in the absence of a vaccine. With a vaccine, social distancing minimizes the sufficient vaccination rate to control the disease. Community awareness also has a great impact in eradicating the virus transmission. The model is simulated on small-world networks and the role of social distancing in controlling the infection is explained.\n","Score: 11.200971784108063\n","\n","Title: Evidence of early community transmission of Omicron (B1.1.529) in Delhi-A city with very high seropositivity and past-exposure!\n","Abstract: Background: Since identification, infections by new SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron are rapidly increasing worldwide. There is huge gap of knowledge regarding virus behaviour in the population from low and middle income countries. Delhi being unique population with a high seropositivity and vaccination rate against COVID-19 infection. We aimed to study the epidemiological and clinical presentations of few early cases of community spread of Omicron infection in the state.\n"," Methods: This is a prospective study where respiratory specimen from all RT-PCR confirmed positive cases between November 25 th -December 23 rd 2021 collected from five districts of Delhi were subjected to whole genome sequencing. Complete demographic and clinical details were recorded. We also analyzed the formation of local and familial clusters and eventual community transmission.\n"," Findings: Out of the 264 cases included during study period, 68.9% (n=182)were identified as Delta and its sub-lineages while 31.06% (n=82) were Omicron with BA.1 as the predominant sub-lineage (73.1%). Most of the Omicron cases were asymptomatic (n=50,61%) and not requiring any hospitalizations. A total of 72 (87.8%) cases were fully vaccinated. 39.1% (n=32) had a history of travel and/or contacts while 60.9 (n=50) showed a community transmission. A steep increase in the daily progression of Omicron cases with its preponderance in the community was observed from 1.8% to 54%.\n"," Interpretation: This study is among the first from India to provide the evidence of community transmission of Omicron with significantly increased breakthrough infections, decreased hospitalization rates, and lower rate of symptomatic infections among individuals with high seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n","Score: 11.143145598649138\n","\n","Title: Exit strategies: optimising feasible surveillance for detection, elimination and ongoing prevention of COVID-19 community transmission\n","Abstract: Following successful implementation of strong containment measures by the community, Australia is now close to the point of eliminating detectable community transmission of COVID-19. We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID-19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated.\n"," We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow-up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population.\n"," Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID-19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22-33 contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests/million population per week using 1/16 pooling of samples.\n"," Screening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system.\n","Score: 10.63288035869463\n","\n","Title: SARS-CoV-2 Transmission and Impacts of Unvaccinated-Only Testing in Populations of Mixed Vaccination Status\n","Abstract: In populations with mixed vaccination status, testing programs focused on only the unvaccinated population are being enacted to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread. However, it is not well understood how viral spread occurs in mixed-status populations, including the possible benefits of unvaccinated-only testing. Here, we analyze a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in which a variable fraction of the population is fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are proactively tested for infection, while varying transmission rates, vaccine effectiveness (VE) parameters, and prior infection rates. This analysis reveals principles of viral spread in communities of mixed vaccination status, with implications for testing policies. As vaccination rates increase, the proportions of infections occurring in unvaccinated individuals and the amount of transmission driven by the unvaccinated both decrease, such that at ∼65-75% vaccine coverage, most infections are vaccine breakthroughs, and at ∼76-83% vaccine coverage, most community spread is driven by breakthrough infections, under baseline mRNA VE assumptions. These ranges shift lower with waning VE and higher with boosted VE. In highly vaccinated communities proactive unvaccinated-only testing had little impact on community spread. Instead, the benefits of weekly unvaccinated-only testing were restricted to regimes with high or moderate ongoing transmission due to lower vaccination rates and strongly depended on near-perfect test compliance. By evaluating a wide range of scenarios, this work finds broadly that resources devoted to routine unvaccinated-only testing could be reallocated when vaccine coverage is sufficiently high. : medRxiv preprint NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.\n"," To examine the dynamics of transmission in a population with mixed vaccination status, we first modeled transmission within and between communities of vaccinated (V ) and unvaccinated (U ) individuals in the absence of a testing program. Based on a standard Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered (SEIR) model, we tracked the four transmission modes by which an infection might spread: U → U , U → V , V → U , and V → V (Fig. 1a) . A constant fraction of both populations was assumed to have experienced prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in four categories of imperfect immunity: unprotected, infection-acquired, vaccine-acquired, and both vaccine-and infection-acquired with so-called \"hybrid\" immunity.

Under this scenario, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in domestic animals to assess the risk of transmission between species have been suggested by the OIE. Here we present a case report of SARS-CoV-2 infection in free roaming dogs, found at a rural indigenous community from the Ecuadorian Amazonia. Oral and nasal swabs samples were collected from three dogs found during a COVID-19 surveillance intervention in Amazonian indigenous communities where severe COVID-19 outbreaks were suspected. Total RNA was extracted from dog samples and detection of SARS-CoV-2 gene targets N, ORF1ab and S was performed. The three dogs tested positive for at least two SARS-CoV-2 viral targets. Moreover, there was a high SARS-CoV-2 infection rate of 87.2% within this community. Given that 17.1% of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals had an ultra high load greater than 10 8 copies/ml, transmission from humans to dogs likely occurred. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 positive free roaming dogs. Also, as those animals were found in the Amazonian forest, SARS-CoV-2 transmission to wild mammals is a potential concern. Given the high presence of free roaming dogs associated to rural and indigenous communities in South America, the potential role of these domestic animals on COVID-19 spread would deserve further surveillance studies involving SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR and molecular epidemiology based on genome sequencing to confirm human to dog transmission.\n","Score: 9.36936677242193\n","\n","Title: Effect of Temperature on the Transmission of COVID-19: A Machine Learning Case Study in Spain\n","Abstract: The novel coronavirus has already spread to almost every country in the world and has infected over 3 million people. To understand the transmission mechanism of this highly contagious virus, it is necessary to study the potential factors, including meteorological conditions. Here, we present a machine learning approach to study the effect of temperature, humidity and wind speed on the number of infected people in the three most populous autonomous communities in Spain. We find that there is a moderate inverse correlation between temperature and the daily number of infections. This correlation manifests for temperatures recorded up to 6 days before the onset, which corresponds well to the known mean incubation period of COVID-19. We also show that the correlation for humidity and wind speed is not significant.\n","Score: 9.208444389713078\n","\n","Title: Evaluating Vaccine Efficacy Against SARS-CoV-2 Infection\n","Abstract: We show how to estimate potentially waning efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection using blood or nasal samples collected periodically from clinical trials with staggered enrollment of participants and crossover of placebo recipients.\n"," Abstract: Although interim results from several large placebo-controlled phase 3 trials demonstrated high vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic COVID-19, it is unknown how effective the vaccines are in preventing people from becoming asymptomatically infected and potentially spreading the virus unwittingly. It is more difficult to evaluate VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection than against symptomatic COVID-19 because infection is not observed directly but rather is known to occur between two antibody or RT-PCR tests. Additional challenges arise as community transmission changes over time and as participants are vaccinated on different dates because of staggered enrollment or crossover before the end of the study. Here, we provide valid and efficient statistical methods for estimating potentially waning VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection with blood or nasal samples under time-varying community transmission, staggered enrollment, and blinded or unblinded crossover. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods through numerical studies mimicking the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial and the Prevent COVID U study. In addition, we assess how crossover and the frequency of diagnostic tests affect the precision of VE estimates.\n","Score: 9.15414703515229\n","\n","Title: The contribution of stigma to the transmission and treatment of tuberculosis in a hyperendemic indigenous population in Brazil\n","Abstract: The Guarani-Kaiowá are Brazil's second-largest indigenous group.

Here, we describe methodological limitations of research minimizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools, and we review evidence for safely operating schools while reducing overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n"," Schools are a critical part of any society in training the next generation, providing important socialization, and enabling the economy to function. They are also recognized drivers of infectious disease spread. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in schools, and that this affects not only those in schools, but also the communities inextricably linked with them. Therefore, when school conditions favor rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, this impacts the course of the pandemic. Importantly, in the absence of systematic and widespread surveillance testing, it is challenging to detect transmission between schools and the community. 1 Rampant transmission fuels viral evolution with the emergence of new viral strains that gain competitive advantage by evading prior immunity, with no promises that they will be less virulent.\n"," The Omicron wave has shown the stiff consequences to safety and educational quality when school transmission is rampant. This includes school closures, use of the National Guard to fill in for sick teachers, student walkouts, talent retention problems, and high pediatric hospitalization rates with predictable consequences on mental health and education quality.\n"," This means that limiting school-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission is important both for controlling viral evolution and providing educationally meaningful in-person learning. To formulate effective strategies to control transmission in schools, we first need to have an objective picture of the potential for schools to propagate SARS-CoV-2 spread. We discuss the limitations of current research on this topic and provide evidence of school-based transmission and its importance. Finally, we describe strategies to keep schools open, while ensuring the safety of students, staff and surrounding communities.\n"," Early in the pandemic, four findings led to the perception of

quarantine loophole\n","Abstract: The ongoing outbreak of novel corona virus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China, is arousing international concern. This study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others.\n"," We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset.\n"," The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period.\n"," The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole.\n"," Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.\n","Score: 17.180095415409117\n","\n","Title: The estimation of SARS incubation distribution from serial interval data using a convolution likelihood\n","Abstract: The incubation period of SARS is the time between infection of disease and onset of symptoms. Knowledge about the distribution of incubation times is crucial in determining the length of quarantine period and is an important parameter in modelling the spread and control of SARS. As the exact time of infection is unknown for most patients, the incubation time cannot be determined. What is observable is the serial interval which is the time from the onset of symptoms in an index case to the onset of symptoms in a subsequent case infected by the index case. By constructing a convolution likelihood based on the serial interval data, we are able to estimate the incubation distribution which is assumed to be Weibull, and justiÿcations are given to support this choice over other distributions. The method is applied to data provided by the Ministry of Health of Singapore and the results justify the choice of a ten-day quarantine period. The indirect estimate obtained using the method of convolution likelihood is validated by means of comparison with a direct estimate obtained directly from a subset of patients for whom the incubation time can be ascertained. Despite its name, the proposed indirect estimate is actually more precise than the direct estimate because serial interval data are recorded for almost all patients, whereas exact incubation times can be determined for only a small subset. It is possible to obtain an even more e cient estimate by using the combined data but the improvement is not substantial.\n","Score: 13.653675778067079\n","\n","Title: Chaos in a nonautonomous eco-epidemiological model with delay\n","Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a nonautonomous predator-prey model with disease in prey, and a discrete time delay for the incubation period in disease transmission. Employing the theory of differential inequalities, we find sufficient conditions for the permanence of the system. Further, we use Lyapunov's functional method to obtain sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability of the system. We observe that the permanence of the system is unaffected due to presence of incubation delay. However, incubation delay affects the global stability of the positive periodic solution of the system. To reinforce the analytical results and to get more insight into the system's behavior, we perform some numerical simulations of the autonomous and nonautonomous systems with and without time delay. We observe that for the gradual increase in the magnitude of incubation delay, the autonomous system develops limit cycle oscillation through a Hopf-bifurcation while the corresponding nonautonomous system shows chaotic dynamics through quasiperiodic oscillations. We apply basic tools of non-linear dynamics such as Poincaré section and maximum Lyapunov exponent to confirm the chaotic behavior of the system.\n","Score: 12.681708700917351\n","\n","Title: EPIDEMIC AND CASE INVESTIGATIONS Surveillance operation for the 141st confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in response to the patient's prior travel to Jeju Island\n","Abstract: The provincial government of Jeju, South Korea, was notified that a 42-year-old man infected with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus had gone sightseeing in Jeju Island. Although the visiting period might be interpreted as the incubation period of MERS, the province decided to conduct active surveillance to prevent a worst-case scenario. Based on the channel of movement of the patient, healthy isolation and active monitoring were conducted for persons who came in contact with the patient. During the active surveillance, none of the 56 persons in self-isolation and 123 persons under active monitoring became infected. This fact supports that MERS is not contagious during the incubation period.\n","Score: 12.250495269362904\n","\n","Title: Optimal periodic closure for minimizing risk in emerging disease outbreaks\n","Abstract: Without vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease-as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variation.\n"," Citation: Hindes J, Bianco S, Schwartz IB (2021) Optimal periodic closure for minimizing risk in emerging disease outbreaks.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n"," Reports on COVID-19 exploded and most of them were focused on adults 2-6 . Research involving pediatric cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection was rare 5,7 . A recent review of 72,314 cases by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that less than 2% of the patients were younger than 19 years 8 . Dong et al analyzed the epidemiology of COVID-19 among children in China, reported that up to February 8, 2020, the total confirmed cases (≤16 years) was 574 national wide 9 . The low incidence of pediatric COVID-19 has perplexed clinicians, epidemiologists and scientist 10 . Most of the researchers believe that children are susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection 7,9,10 , the absence of pediatric patients with COVID-19 should be attributed to low exposure to COVID-19 patients 4 . Xu et al 7 screened 745 children and 3,174 adults by nasopharyngeal swab real-time PCR with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 infection, found that confirmed cases were much fewer in children after exposure to COVID-19 patients than that in adults. Thus, if children have lower susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes a matter of debate. During the progress of COVID-19 outbreak, Zhejiang was one of the hard-hit provinces 9 . The number of confirmed cases rose rapidly along with the return of merchants and college students who lived in Wuhan before the Spring Festival, which made it possible to perform a family clustering study on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. During the preparation of our manuscript, a report on clinical and epidemiological features of 36 children (≤16 years) with COVID-19 in Zhejiang, China, the same region as our study, was published on the journal of Lancet Infectious Disease 11 . The data showed that children with COVID-19 had mild or asymptomatic disease accompanied by pneumonia in about half the cases. Certainly, there was some overlap of patients' population in both studies. Our study had with respiratory specimen. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children contacts (13.2%, 43/325,) was lower than that in those adults contacts (21.2%, 108/510, 95%CI 17.6-24.7), and the difference was statistically significant (χ 2 =8.46, P=0.004).\n"," The 43 cases who were not more than 14 years were analyzed, and 26 (60.5%, 26/43) were male.\n"," The children's ages were from 3m20d to 14 y with a mean of 8.16 years (SD: 4.07). Forty children (93.0%) belong to family clustering cases and had long-term exposure (lived together with the family members with COVID-19 or had lived in epidemic areas, ie, Wuhan, or other cities in Hubei province). Three (7.0%, 3/43) children had short-term exposure to COVID-19 patients directly (occasional visits or in public transportations). The incubation periods were ranging from 4 days to 21 days, with a mean of 9.1 (SD: 3.7) days. Three patients (9.4%, 3/32) had incubation stages for more than 14 days. Twenty children (46.5%，20/43) were imported cases: 13 children lived in Hubei province (12 in Wuhan city); 6 children were on vacation for 5-10 days in Hubei province (3 in Wuhan); and 1 child lived in Henan province and came to Hangzhou for medical advice after his father, who is a doctor and treated suspected COVID-19 patients from Wuhan in his private clinic in countryside, thought they might have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Feces were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 35 children by RT-PCR more than one time, and positive results were found in 32 (91.4%, 32/35) children.\n"," SARS-CoV-2 infection are shown in Table 2 . Two patients had vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain after receiving oral lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol, and atomization inhalation with interferon-α2b days with a range as 4~21 days in the present study, which could partly explain why the number of pediatric cases was peaked two weeks after that of adult cases. A long incubation period in children indicated that quarantine period for children who had contacted confirmed patients should be longer.\n"," Similar with the findings in previous studies 5,7,20 , symptoms in most of the pediatric patients with COVID-19 were mild, or even none. Most of patients did not seek medical care, and they were diagnosed because of their exposure history. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, which were milder or even transient. Headaches, fatigue and chest tightness, which were common symptoms in adults, were rare in children in our study. All of the patients recovered soon.\n"," Leukopenia and lymphocytopenia were not common and most of the children had normal C-reactive protein, which indicated the inflammatory response was mild.\n"," Although children with SARS-CoV-2 infection had mild symptoms or even were asymptomatic, chest CT was still widely used. Most of the children received chest CT more than one time.\n"," Accordingly, more pneumonia, including \"asymptomatic pneumonia\", was confirmed based on abnormalities in chest CT imaging. Image manifestation was found upon admission in most adult patients, and the typical findings of chest CT images were bilateral pneumonia, multiple lobular ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation 2-6,17,21 . Twenty percent of the children with pneumonia in our study were confirmed at the second weeks in hospital, or even after being discharged. The most common findings were unilateral pneumonia, isolated ground-glass opacity. Transient fever or respiratory symptoms were not present in half of the viral excretion was not conclusive and further study is needed. At last, positive results of fecal SARS-CoV-2RNA detection should not be used as indication for hospitalization or quarantine.\n","Score: 10.166576334781894\n","\n","Title: Data-driven multi-scale mathematical modeling of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals heterogeneity among COVID-19 patients\n","Abstract: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often exhibit diverse disease progressions associated with various infectious ability, symptoms, and clinical treatments. To systematically and thoroughly understand the heterogeneous progression of COVID-19, we developed a multi-scale computational model to quantitatively understand the heterogeneous progression of COVID-19 patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The model consists of intracellular viral dynamics, multicellular infection process, and immune responses, and was formulated using a combination of differential equations and stochastic modeling. By integrating multi-source clinical data with model analysis, we quantified individual heterogeneity using two indexes, i.e., the ratio of infected cells and incubation period. Specifically, our simulations revealed that increasing the host antiviral state or virus induced type I interferon (IFN) production rate can prolong the incubation period and postpone the transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic outcomes. We further identified the threshold dynamics of T cell exhaustion in the transition between mild-moderate and severe symptoms, and that patients with severe symptoms exhibited a lack of naïve T cells at a late stage. In addition, we quantified the efficacy of treating COVID-19 patients and investigated the effects of various therapeutic strategies. Simulations results suggested that single antiviral therapy is sufficient for moderate patients, while combination therapies and prevention of T cell exhaustion are needed for severe patients. These results highlight the critical roles of IFN and T cell responses in regulating the stage transition during COVID-19 progression. Our study reveals a quantitative relationship underpinning the heterogeneity of transition stage during COVID-19 progression and can provide a potential guidance for personalized therapy in COVID-19 patients.\n","Score: 9.50917792250815\n","\n","Title: Environmental Dependence of the Structure of the C-terminal Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Envelope Protein Running title: Conformational dynamics of E C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2\n","Abstract: 1. The E-CTD of SARS-CoV-2 is intrinsically disordered in solution 2. The E-CTD folds into an ordered structure in presence of membrane mimetics 3. The E-CTD displays conformational changes in the presence of osmolytes 4. Prolonged incubation of the E-CTD leads to its self-assembly into amyloid-like fibrils\n"," The SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E) is involved in a broad spectrum of functions in the cycle of the virus, including assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. To enable these activities, E is likely to be capable of changing its conformation depending on environmental cues. To investigate this issue, here we characterised the structural properties of the C-terminal domain of E (E-CTD), which has been reported to interact with host cell membranes. We first studied the conformation of the E-CTD in solution, finding characteristic features of a disordered protein. By contrast, in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles and micelles, which mimic cell membranes, the E-CTD was observed to become structured. The E-CTD was also found to display conformational changes with osmolytes. Furthermore, prolonged incubation of the E-CTD under physiological conditions resulted in amyloid-like fibril formation. Taken together, these findings indicate that the E-CTD can change its conformation depending on its environment, ranging from a disordered state, to a membranebound folded state, and an amyloid state. Our results thus provide insight into the structural basis of the role of E in the viral infection process.\n","Score: 9.335854277532148\n","\n","Title: Article 671173 Mai, Thailand, 7 Research Center on Chemistry for Development of Health Promoting Products from Northern Resources\n","Abstract: A novel copper (II) ions [Cu(II)]-graphene oxide (GO) nanocomplex-modified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) is successfully developed as a versatile electrochemical platform for construction of sensors without an additionally external redox probe.

This work demonstrates the fabrications of two kinds of electrochemical sensors, i.e., a new label-free electrochemical immunosensor and non-enzymatic sensor for detections of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and glucose, respectively. Our immunosensor based on square-wave voltammetry (SWV) of the redox GO-modified electrode shows the linearity in a dynamic range of 1.0-500 pg.mL −1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.20 pg.mL −1 for the detection of IgG while non-enzymatic sensor reveals two dynamic ranges of 0.10-1.00 mM (sensitivity = 36.31 µA.mM −1 .cm −2 ) and 1.00-12.50 mM (sensitivity = 3.85 µA.mM −1 .cm −2 ) with a LOD value of 0.12 mM.

Specifically, uncovering the relationship between epidemic onset and various risk indicators such as socioeconomic, mobility and climate factors can reveal locations and travel patterns that play critical roles in furthering an outbreak. We study the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza outbreaks in Sweden's municipalities between 2009 and 2015 and use the Generalized Inverse Infection Method (GIIM) to assess the most significant contributing risk factors. GIIM represents an epidemic spreading process on a network: nodes correspond to geographical objects, links indicate travel routes, and transmission probabilities assigned to the links guide the infection process. Our results reinforce existing observations that the influenza outbreaks considered in this study were driven by the country's largest population centers, while meteorological factors also contributed significantly. Travel and other socioeconomic indicators have a negligible effect. We also demonstrate that by training our model on the 2009 outbreak, we can predict the epidemic onsets in the following five seasons with high accuracy.\n"," In this paper, we seek to uncover the critical socioeconomic, travel, and meteorological factors behind H1N1 outbreaks in Sweden, covering six years between 2009 and 2015, focusing on the start of the epidemic phase. We aim to identify the relationship between the timing of this event and the above factors available for each of the 290 municipalities of Sweden. We also explore the predictive capabilities of our approach by using the 2009 pandemic to train our model and measuring its performance on data from the following years. We analyze Sweden at a much higher resolution compared with previous studies 13 and extend the potential list of risk factors.\n"," We analyze disease spreading dynamics with the Generalized Inverse Infection Model (GIIM) 19,20,23 , a network-based optimization method. In this model, each municipality is a node, and the edges between nodes represent possible disease spreading paths. The primary output of this model is the set of estimated transmission probabilities between the nodes (geographical areas) of the model. These probabilities can be formalized as a function of known attributes: properties of the nodes (municipalities) and edges (pairs of municipalities) of the network. We estimate the parameters of this function with the Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization Method 21 . GIIM can be used with any monotonic infection model, including members of the SEIR family 20,22 . Since our goal is to estimate the timing of the epidemic onset, we select the SI infection model 22 to represent spreading dynamics. The SI model has been used in literature when modeling the first occurrence of a disease and spreading dynamics during the early phase of an outbreak 23,24 . The epidemic onset falls into the latter category.\n"," We use GIIM to estimate the transmission risk between geographical areas, the importation and exportation risks for all municipalities, and to establish the relationship between the properties of the outbreak and several socioeconomic, travel and meteorological indicators. In addition, we can use the risk factors, their assigned weights, and the attribute function to simulate an outbreak during any given time period, allowing us to predict the timing of the epidemic onset in future seasons. We demonstrate this by training our model on data from the 2009 pandemic and predicting the timing of the onset in later seasons with good accuracy.\n","Score: 9.68974145874411\n","\n","Title: Pollen Explains Flu-Like and COVID-19 Seasonality 1 2\n","Abstract: Current models for flu-like epidemics insufficiently explain multi-cycle seasonality.

This study aims to estimate the all-cause excess mortality occurring in the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, 2020, by sex and age group. Methods: Daily time series of mortality for the period January 2015-December 2020 in all 47 prefectures of Japan were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan. A two-stage interrupted time-series design was used to calculate excess mortality. In the first stage, we estimated excess mortality by prefecture using quasi-Poisson regression models in combination with distributed lag non-linear models, adjusting for seasonal and long-term variations, weather conditions and influenza activity. In the second stage, we used a random-effects multivariate meta-analysis to synthesize prefecture-specific estimates at the nationwide level. Results: In 2020, we estimated an all-cause excess mortality of À20 982 deaths [95% empirical confidence intervals (eCI): À38 367 to À5472] in Japan, which corresponded to a percentage excess of À1.7% (95% eCI: À3.1 to À0.5) relative to the expected value. Reduced deaths were observed for both sexes and in all age groups except those aged <60 and 70-79 years. Conclusions: All-cause mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan in 2020 was decreased compared with a historical baseline. Further evaluation of cause-specific excess mortality is warranted.\n","Score: 8.740102672643339\n","\n","Title: An open-label, randomized clinical trial assessing immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted vaccine administered sequentially or simultaneously with seasonal virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccine to paediatric kidney transplant recipients\n","Abstract: Background. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of the 2009 A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, administered sequentially or simultaneously with the seasonal 2009-10 virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, to paediatric kidney transplant recipients. Methods. Thirty-two children and adolescents with transplanted kidneys and 32 age-and gender-matched healthy controls were randomized 1:1 to receive the pandemic vaccine upon enrolment and the seasonal vaccine 1 month later (16 transplant recipients and 16 healthy controls), or to receive the two vaccines simultaneously upon enrolment (16 transplant recipients and 16 healthy controls). Results. When the pandemic vaccine was administered sequentially to the seasonal vaccine, it was significantly less immunogenic in the patients than in the controls (P < 0.05); when it was administered together with the seasonal vaccine, the immune response of both patients (P < 0.05) and controls (P < 0.05) was significantly greater than when it was administered sequentially. Seroconversion rates and the geometric mean titres of all of the seasonal antigens were significantly lower in the patients, regardless of the type of vaccine administration (P < 0.05). Simultaneous administration was associated with a better immune response against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 antigens in both patients and controls, and did not increase the mild local and systemic reactions. No impact on renal function was observed.\n"," Conclusions. Paediatric kidney transplant recipients have a lower immune response to the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted and seasonal virosomal-adjuvanted influenza vaccines than healthy controls. The simultaneous administration of the two vaccines seems to increase immune response to both pandemic and seasonal A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 antigens, and has the same safety profile as that of the pandemic vaccine administered sequentially to the seasonal vaccine.\n","Score: 8.729174925979082\n","\n","Title: Environmental factors, winter respiratory infections and the seasonal variation in heart failure admissions\n","Abstract: Seasonal cycles of AHF are causally attributed to the seasonal pattern of respiratory tract infections. However, this assumption has never been formally validated. We aimed to determine whether the increase in winter admissions for acute heart failure (AHF) can be explained by seasonal infectious diseases. We studied 12,147 patients admitted for AHF over a period of 11 years (2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015). Detailed virology and bacteriology data were collected on each patient. Meteorological information including daily temperature and relative humidity was obtained for the same period. The peak-to-low ratio, indicating the intensity of seasonality, was calculated using negative binomial regression-derived incidence rate ratios (IRR). AHF admissions occurred with a striking annual periodicity, peaking in winter (December-February) and were lowest in summer (June-August), with a seasonal amplitude (January vs. August) of 2.00 ([95% CI 1.\n"," influenza-like infections also followed a strong seasonal pattern (P < 0.0001; Peak/low ratio 2.42 [95% CI 1.394-3.03]). However, after exclusion of all respiratory infections, the seasonal variation in AHF remained robust (Peak/low ratio January vs. August, 1.81 [95% CI 1.60-2.05]; P < 0.0001). There was a strong inverse association between AHF admissions and average monthly temperature (IRR 0.95 per 1℃ increase; 95% CI 0.94 to 0.96). In conclusion, these is a dominant seasonal modulation of AHF admissions which is only partly explained by the incidence of winter respiratory infections. Environmental factors modify the susceptibility of heart failure patients to decompensation.\n"," The natural history of heart failure is characterized by acute decompensation episodes, which are the leading cause for hospitalization among patients older than 65 years of age, with over 1 million annual primary admissions 1,2 . Increasing signs and symptoms of congestion are the main reasons why patients with acute heart failure seek urgent medical care 3 . Although some patients are admitted with a clear correctable trigger, a clear precipitating factor cannot be identified in many patients.\n"," Some cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, follow a seasonal variation pattern of exacerbation 4,5 . Previous studies showed a rise in acute heart failure admissions in the winter 4,5 . This pattern was described both in the northern 6 and the southern hemispheres 7 .\n"," The underlying mechanism for this phenomenon and which patients are more prone to suffer acute exacerbation is not known, but it is frequently assumed that the increase in AHF admission may follow the seasonal pattern of infectious diseases, particularly respiratory tract infections 5 . However, some previous studies relied on administrative databases based on discharge diagnoses, included both acute and chronic heart failure patients, and lacked clinical data other than age and gender 4,5 . None of these studies formally investigated the extent to which seasonal variation is explained by specific climatic factors and the potential causal relationship between infections and excess winter admissions.\n"," In the present study, our objectives were to determine whether the increase in winter admissions for AHF can be explained by specific patient's characteristic or triggering by seasonal infectious diseases.\n","Score: 8.579605631183902\n","\n","Title: Influence of the H1N1 influenza pandemic on the humoral immune response to seasonal flu vaccines\n","Abstract: In this study, we hypothesized that the humoral response to trivalent seasonal influenza virus vaccines was influenced by rapid antigenic switching of H1 HA. We tested archived sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected at prior to vaccination at day 0, as well as days 30 and 90 after vaccination during the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 influenza virus seasons. During the 2009/2010 season, vaccination successfully induced antibodies with hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) activity against both H1N1 and H3N2 vaccine components. For the 2010/2011 season, the A/California/04/2009 (CA/09) H1N1 elicited seroconversion (HAI titer = 1:40) and novel memory B cell (B mem ) responses from most individuals. However, the H3N2 influenza virus component of the vaccine, A/Perth/16/2009 (Perth/09), back-boosted and elicited antibodies with HAI activity and B mem response to historical H3N2 influenza virus strains. Following stratification of the pre-existing antibody with HAI against the CA/09 H1N1, there was a negative correlation with HAI seroconversion to other vaccine strains. Overall, strong immune responses against CA/09 H1N1 influenza virus negatively influenced the induction of novel humoral responses.

between Civic Morality and Support for Environmental Taxation\n","Abstract: Climate change and pollution are threatening sustainable environments and human life. To mitigate and adapt to the effects of such threats, governments around the world need significant financial resources. Accordingly, this study focuses on which factors are associated with individuals' support for taxation to protect the environment and pays special attention to the direct effects of civic morality and political trust, as well as their joint effects on support for environmental taxation. Ordered probit results with a sample size of 760 demonstrate that civic morality is positively associated with individuals' support for environmental taxation; political trust works in the same way. More importantly, political trust moderates and enhances the linkage between civic morality and support for environmental taxation, demonstrating that it can serve as a powerful tool in a government's efforts to protect the environment.\n","Score: 9.054351397128034\n","\n","Title: Daily Stress and Behavioral Problems in Chinese Children: The Moderating Roles of Family Functioning and the Classroom Environment\n","Abstract: Grounded in the stress-coping model, our study examined family functioning and the classroom environment as protective factors in the relationship between daily stress and behavioral problems in Chinese children. The participants were 1,450 children (51.7% male, M age = 10.91 years, SD = 0.96) in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades at five schools. The children completed the questionnaires measuring daily stress, family functioning, and the classroom environment. Additionally, their parents rated their behavioral problems. The latent moderated structural (LMS) equation approach was used to test moderator effects. After controlling for sex and grade, our results indicate that daily stress positively predicted the children's behavioral problems. Both family functioning and the classroom environment moderated the relationship between daily stress and behavioral problems. Further assessment of latent interaction effects indicate that buffering effects on behavioral problems were most prominent in conditions involving low stress. In sum, families and schools should not ignore children's minor stressors, as interventions involving family functioning and favorable classroom environments may help to reduce behavioral problems in children who report low levels of daily stress.\n","Score: 8.991172139282003\n","\n","Title: Comprehensive codon usage analysis of porcine deltacoronavirus\n","Abstract: Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly identified coronavirus of pigs that was first reported in Hong Kong in 2012. Since then, many PDCoV isolates have been identified worldwide. In this study, we analyzed the codon usage pattern of the S gene using complete coding sequences and complete PDCoV genomes to gain a deeper understanding of their genetic relationships and evolutionary history. We found that during evolution three groups evolved with a relatively low codon usage bias (effective number of codons (ENC) of 52). The factors driving bias were complex. However, the primary element influencing the codon bias of PDCoVs was natural selection. Our results revealed that different natural environments may have a significant impact on the genetic characteristics of the strains. In the future, more epidemiological surveys are required to examine the factors that resulted in the emergence and outbreak of this virus.\n","Score: 8.981786828440788\n","\n","Title: The Value of Early Positive Nucleic Acid Test and Negative Conversion Time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the Clinical Outcome of COVID-19 Patients\n","Abstract: Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses a great threat to global public health. At present, the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths is increasing worldwide. The strategy of comprehensive and scientific detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for special populations and environments provides great support for the prevention and control of this pandemic in China. Our study focused on determining the factors associated with the length of time from symptom onset to the first positive nucleic acid test of throat swabs in COVID-19 patients, evaluating the effect of early positive nucleic acid detection on the disease severity and its significance in prognosis, and predicting the factors associated with the time from positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test to negative conversion (negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 virus) in COVID-19 patients. in Wuhan, China. Throat swab samples were collected for qRT-PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and all patients included in this study were positive for this test.\n"," The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that disease severity (HR = 0.572; 95% CI 0.348-0.942; p = 0.028) was a protective factor for the time from symptom onset to positive nucleic acid detection. Meanwhile, the time from symptom onset to positive nucleic acid detection (HR = 1.010; 95% CI 1.005-1.020; p = 0.0282) was an independent risk factor for the delay in negative conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, the severity of the disease (HR=1.120; 95% CI 0.771-1.640; p = 0.544) had no correlation with the negative conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n"," Patients with more severe disease had a shorter time from symptom onset to a positive nucleic acid test.

An underappreciated risk in current regulatory guidelines and scholarly discussions, however, is that the persisting input of chemical disinfectants can exacerbate the growth of biocidetolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria on those surfaces and allow their direct transfers to humans. For COVID-19, the most commonly used disinfecting agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, and ethanol, which account for two-thirds of the active ingredients in current EPA-approved disinfectant products for the novel coronavirus. Tolerance to each of these compounds, which can be either intrinsic or acquired, has been observed on various bacterial pathogens. Of those, mutations and horizontal gene transfer, upregulation of efflux pumps, membrane alteration, and biofilm formation are the common mechanisms conferring biocide tolerance in bacteria. Further, the linkage between disinfectant use and antibiotic resistance was suggested in laboratory and real-life settings. Evidence showed that substantial bacterial transfers to hands could effectuate from short contacts with surrounding surfaces and further from fingers to lips. While current literature on disinfectant-induced antimicrobial resistance predominantly focuses on municipal wastes and the natural environments, in reality the community and public settings are most severely impacted by intensive and regular chemical disinfecting during COVID-19 and, due to their proximity to humans, biocidetolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria emerged in these environments may pose risks of direct transfers to humans, particularly in densely populated urban communities. Here we highlight these risk factors by reviewing the most pertinent and up-to-date evidence, and provide several feasible strategies to mitigate these risks in the scenario of a prolonging pandemic.\n","Score: 7.98973754374517\n","\n","Title: Quality of life of patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: The biopsychosocial path\n","Abstract: Previous models that assess quality-of-Life (QoL) in patients with rheumatic diseases have a strong biomedical focus.

In this post-epidemic era, these countries began to revive their economy. However, pollution remains in the environment, and people's physical and psychological health has been under threat due to some over-prevention behaviors. Instruments for governmental agencies to manage these behaviors are not yet available. This study aims to develop a measurement model to identify and measure the degree of over-prevention behaviors during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Methods: A survey online was conducted to collect cognition from 1528 Chinese people, including descriptions of various over-prevention behaviors defined by health authorities. Factor analyses were used to develop the measurement model and test its validity. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore demographic characteristics, indicating people who are inclined to exhibit over-prevention behaviors. Results: Four main factors were extracted to develop the model (eigenvalue = 7.337, 3.157, 1.447, and 1.059, respectively). The overall reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.900), the convergent (AVE > 0.5, CR > 0.8 for each factor) and discriminant validity is good. There is also a good internal consistency among these factors (Cronbach's α = 0.906, 0.852, 0.882, and 0.763, respectively). In Factor 1, gender has a negative effect (Beta = − 0.294, P < 0.05, OR = 0.745), whereas employment has a positive effect. Workers in institutions exhibit the greatest effect (Beta = 0.855, P < 0.001, OR = 2.352). In Factor 2, employment has a negative effect, with workers in institutions exhibit the greatest role (Beta = − 0.963, P < 0.001, OR = 0.382). By contrast, education level has a positive effect (Beta = 0.430, P < 0.001, OR = 1.537). In Factor 3, age plays a negative role (Beta = − 0.128, P < 0.05, OR = 0.880).\n"," Conclusions: People show a discrepancy in the cognition toward various over-prevention behaviors. The findings may have implications for decision-makers to reduce the contradiction between the epidemic and economic revival via managing these behaviors.\n","Score: 7.737731231686178\n","\n","Title: -19 in Ghana: Evidence from Physical Education Practical-Oriented Program\n","Abstract: Citation: Quansah, F.; Hagan, J.E., Jr.; Sambah, F.; Frimpong, J.B.; Ankomah, F.; Srem-Sai, M.; Seibu, M.; Abieraba, R.S.K.; Schack, T.

This study sought to identify and quantify possible drivers for the MERS-CoV emergence and spillover to humans. A list of potential human, animal and environmental drivers for disease emergence were identified from literature. Trends in possible drivers were analyzed from national and international databases, and through structured interviews with experts in Qatar. The discovery and exploitation of oil and gas led to a 5-fold increase in Qatar GDP coupled with a 7-fold population growth in the past 30 years. The lifestyle gradually transformed from Bedouin life to urban sedentary life, along with a sharp increase in obesity and other comorbidities. Owing to substantial governmental support, camel husbandry and competitions flourished, exacerbating the already rapidly occurring desertification that forced banning of free grazing in 2005. Consequently, camels were housed in compact barns alongside their workers. The transition in husbandry leading to high density camel farming along with increased exposure to humans, combined with the increase of camel movement for the racing and breeding industry, have led to a convergence of factors driving spillover of MERS-CoV from camels to humans. 13 of 15 to provide \"hard evidence\" of causality. Nevertheless, this is the first comprehensive quantitative overview of possible drivers of MERS-CoV in Qatar.\n"," Several key changes were shown to involve camels, humans, the economy, and the environment in Qatar during the last 30 years. Our study indicates that the rapid increase in camel ownership, leading to the presence of camels from different origins in a high-density environment mixed together with human and other animal species may have offered the right circumstances for the virus to spread from camels to humans. The other key changes that were described collectively contributed to this situation. Further understanding of the drivers that led to the emergence of MERS-CoV can serve as input for MERS-CoV surveillance and control measures to prevent further spread of MERS-CoV and reduce transmission from camels to humans.\n","Score: 7.363996934267615\n","\n","Title: Viral genome-capsid core senses host environments to Short Title: Role of RNA in TCV disassembly\n","Abstract: Viruses are metastable macromolecular assemblies containing a nucleic acid core packaged by 24 capsid proteins that are primed to disassemble in host-specific environments leading to genome 25 release and replication. The mechanism of how viruses sense environmental changes associated 26 with host entry to prime them for disassembly is unknown. We have applied a combination of 27 mass spectrometry, cryo-EM, and simulation-assisted structure refinement to Turnip crinkle virus 28 (TCV), which serves as a model non-enveloped icosahedral virus (Triangulation number = 3, 180 29 copies/icosahedron). Our results reveal genomic RNA tightly binds a subset of viral coat proteins 30 to form a stable RNA-capsid core which undergoes conformational switching in response to host-31 specific environmental changes. These changes include: i) Depletion of Ca 2+ which triggers viral 32 particle expansion ii) Increase in osmolytes further disrupt interactions of outer coat proteins from 33 the RNA-capsid core to promote complete viral disassembly. A cryo-EM structure of the expanded 34 particle shows that RNA is asymmetrically extruded from a single 5-fold axis during disassembly. 35 The genomic RNA:capsid protein interactions confer metastability to the TCV capsid and drive 36 release of RNA from the disassembling virion within the plant host cell. 37 AUTHOR SUMMARY: 38 RNA viruses including coronaviruses, dengue, influenza, and HIV are a significant threat to human 39 health. These viral particles are finely tuned to undergo complex conformational changes that 40 allow for response to varied environments. Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) serves as an excellent 41 model for studying RNA virus dynamics. Since TCV is non-enveloped and has no post-42 translational modifications, we can specifically investigate the contributions of RNA to viral 43 dynamics. Genomic RNA is not a passive entity but plays a crucial and previously uncharacterized 3 44 role in viral disassembly. Our results reveal that the genomic RNA-capsid core serves as an 45 environmental sensor and undergoes conformational switching in response to host cell conditions. 46 47\n","Score:

Viruses on Inanimate Surfaces\n","Abstract: In the present study, we evaluated the viability of non-enveloped viruses, minute virus of mice (MVM) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), and enveloped-viruses, influenza A virus (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), on surfaces. We also investigated the impact of the initial concentration of proteins and sodium chloride on the persistence of infectious CVB4 on surfaces. Viral suspensions (>10 4.5 TCID 50 ) were applied to petri dish lids and dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet. The recovered viral preparations were titered on appropriate cell lines. Enveloped viruses persisted for less than 5 days while CVB4 and MVM persisted for weeks. However, repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension had a stronger virucidal effect on CVB4 than on H1N1 and HSV-1. These repetitive cycles had no effect on the infectious titer of MVM. When exposed to drying, the initial concentrations of bovine serum albumin (from 0 to 90 mg mL −1 ), fetal calf serum (from 0 to 100%), and sodium chloride (from 0 to 300 mg mL −1 ) affected the viability of CVB4. CVB4 was more likely to be inactivated by drying in a protein-rich medium, whereas the impact of drying was reduced in the presence of sodium chloride. The results of the present study demonstrated that the resistance of viruses to drying, as suggested by iterative drying, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral subpopulations, but was influenced by media compositions and component concentrations, as illustrated in the model of CVB4.\n","Score: 23.03960536002719\n","\n","Title: Persistence against benzalkonium chloride promotes rapid evolution of tolerance during periodic disinfection\n","Abstract: Biocides used as disinfectants are important to prevent the transmission of pathogens, especially during the current antibiotic resistance crisis. This crisis is exacerbated by phenotypically tolerant persister subpopulations that can survive transient antibiotic treatment and facilitate resistance evolution. Here, we show that E. coli displays persistence against a widely used disinfectant, benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Periodic, persister-mediated failure of disinfection rapidly selects for BAC tolerance, which is associated with reduced cell surface charge and mutations in the lpxM locus, encoding an enzyme for lipid A biosynthesis. Moreover, the fitness cost incurred by BAC tolerance turns into a fitness benefit in the presence of antibiotics, suggesting a selective advantage of BAC-tolerant mutants in antibiotic environments. Our findings highlight the links between persistence to disinfectants and resistance evolution to antimicrobials.\n","Score: 11.213874320892291\n","\n","Title: Journal Pre-proof Surface Chemistry Can Unlock Drivers of Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in Variety of Environmental Conditions Surface Chemistry Can Unlock Drivers of Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in Variety of Environmental Conditions\n","Abstract: The surface stability and resulting transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, specifically in indoor environments, have been identified as a potential pandemic challenge requiring investigation. This novel virus can be found on various surfaces in contaminated sites such as clinical places, however, the behaviour and molecular interactions of the virus with respect to the surfaces are poorly understood. Regarding this, the virus adsorption onto solid surfaces can play a critical role in transmission and survival in various environments. In this article, firstly an overview of existing knowledge concerning viral spread, molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2, and the virus surface stability is presented. Then, we highlight potential drivers of the SARS-CoV-2 surface adsorption and stability in various environmental conditions. This theoretical analysis shows that different surface and environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, and pH are crucial considerations in building fundamental understanding of the virus transmission and thereby improving safety practices.\n"," Coronavirus genomes are comparatively large for RNA viruses and SARS-CoV-2 encodes an extensive complement of non-structural proteins (e.g. 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CL) protease, papainlike protease, etc.) as well as structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein 1 .

The highlighted findings shed lights onto the potential molecular interactions between the virus and the solid surface which lead to further virus adsorption, viability, and transmission processes, and can help community to take necessary measures to tackle associated challenges.\n"," Challenges and opportunities:\n"," • The novel SARS-CoV-2 can be recognised on various surfaces in a contaminated site, and its stability in different environmental conditions has been reported.\n","Score: 11.077213530236858\n","\n","Title: A new long-term sampling approach to viruses on surfaces\n","Abstract: The importance of virus disease outbreaks and its prevention is of growing public concern but our understanding of virus transmission routes is limited by adequate sampling strategies. While conventional swabbing methods provide merely a microbial snapshot, an ideal sampling strategy would allow reliable collection of viral genomic data over longer time periods. This study has evaluated a new, paper-based sticker approach for collection of reliable viral genomic data over longer time periods up to 14 days and after implementation of different hygiene measures. In contrast to swabbing methods, which sample viral load present on a surface at a given time, the paper-based stickers are attached to the surface area of interest and collect viruses that would have otherwise been transferred onto that surface. The major advantage of one-side adhesive stickers is that they are permanently attachable to a variety of surfaces. Initial results demonstrate that stickers permit stable recovery characteristics, even at low virus titers. Stickers also allow reliable virus detection after implementation of routine hygiene measures and over longer periods up to 14 days. Overall, results for this new sticker approach for virus genomic data collection are encouraging, but further studies are required to confirm anticipated benefits over a range of virus types.\n","Score: 10.618611449819547\n","\n","Title: Pathogen-Repellent Plastic Warp with Built-In Hierarchical Structuring Prevents the Contamination of Surfaces with Coronaviruses\n","Abstract: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that viral spread is mediated through several different transmission pathways. Reduction of these transmission pathways is urgently needed to control the spread of viruses between infected and susceptible individuals. Herein, we report the use of pathogen-repellent plastic wraps (RepelWrap) with engineered surface structures at multiple length scales (nanoscale to microscale) as a means of reducing the indirect contact transmission of viruses through fomites. To quantify viral repellency, we developed a touch-based viral quantification assay to mimic the interaction of a contaminated human touch with a surface through the modification of traditional viral quantification methods (viral plaque and TCID50 assays). These studies demonstrate that RepelWrap reduced contamination with an enveloped DNA virus as well as the human coronavirus 229E (HuCoV-229E) by more than 4 log 10 (>99.99%) compared to a standard commercially available polyethylene plastic wrap. In addition, RepelWrap maintained its repellent properties after repeated 300 touches and did not show an accumulation in viral titer after multiple contacts with contaminated surfaces, while increases were seen on other commonly used surfaces. These findings show the potential use of repellent surfaces in reducing viral contamination on surfaces, which could, in turn, reduce the surface-based spread and transmission.\n","Score: 10.527258531236894\n","\n","Title: Persistent SARS-2 infections contribute to long COVID-19\n","Abstract: A B S T R A C T COVID-19 is a serious disease that has infected more than 40 million people. Beside significant mortality, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes considerable and sustained morbidity, dubbed long COVID. This paper argues that some of this morbidity may be due to a persistent systemic infection. Persistent infection is indicated by continued virus RNA shedding. The virus' superantigen could overstimulate anti-virus immune responses, and thereby induce negative feedback loops, that paradoxically allow the virus to persist. The superantigen would induce strong immune response to any residual infection. This hypothesis suggests that clearing the virus infection completely would be an appropriate intervention against long COVID.\n","Score: 10.432016340679908\n","\n","Title: Biocide-tolerance and antibiotic-resistance in community environments and risk of direct transfers to humans: Unintended consequences of community-wide surface disinfecting during COVID-19? *\n","Abstract: During the current pandemic, chemical disinfectants are ubiquitously and routinely used in community environments, especially on common touch surfaces in public settings, as a means of controlling the virus spread. An underappreciated risk in current regulatory guidelines and scholarly discussions, however, is that the persisting input of chemical disinfectants can exacerbate the growth of biocidetolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria on those surfaces and allow their direct transfers to humans. For COVID-19, the most commonly used disinfecting agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, and ethanol, which account for two-thirds of the active ingredients in current EPA-approved disinfectant products for the novel coronavirus. Tolerance to each of these compounds, which can be either intrinsic or acquired, has been observed on various bacterial pathogens. Of those, mutations and horizontal gene transfer, upregulation of efflux pumps, membrane alteration, and biofilm formation are the common mechanisms conferring biocide tolerance in bacteria. Further, the linkage between disinfectant use and antibiotic resistance was suggested in laboratory and real-life settings. Evidence showed that substantial bacterial transfers to hands could effectuate from short contacts with surrounding surfaces and further from fingers to lips. While current literature on disinfectant-induced antimicrobial resistance predominantly focuses on municipal wastes and the natural environments, in reality the community and public settings are most severely impacted by intensive and regular chemical disinfecting during COVID-19 and, due to their proximity to humans, biocidetolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria emerged in these environments may pose risks of direct transfers to humans, particularly in densely populated urban communities. Here we highlight these risk factors by reviewing the most pertinent and up-to-date evidence, and provide several feasible strategies to mitigate these risks in the scenario of a prolonging pandemic.\n","Score: 10.395749318671262\n","\n","Title: A simian hemorrhagic fever virus isolate from persistently infected baboons efficiently induces hemorrhagic fever disease in Japanese macaques\n","Abstract: Simian hemorrhagic fever virus is an arterivirus that naturally infects species of African nonhuman primates causing acute or persistent asymptomatic infections. Although it was previously estimated that 1% of baboons are SHFV-positive, more than 10% of wild-caught and captive-bred baboons tested were SHFV positive and the infections persisted for more than 10 years with detectable virus in the blood (100-1000 genomes/ml). The sequences of two baboon SHFV isolates that were amplified by a single passage in primary macaque macrophages had a high degree of identity to each other as well as to the genome of SHFV-LVR, a laboratory strain isolated in the 1960s. Infection of Japanese macaques with 100 PFU of a baboon isolate consistently produced high level viremia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, elevated tissue factor levels and clinical signs indicating coagulation defects. The baboon virus isolate provides a reliable BSL2 model of viral hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques. (M.A. Brinton).

A number of variants with deletions and mutations in the S protein have been isolated from naturally and persistently infected animals and tissue cultures. Here, we report the emergence and isolation of two temperature sensitive (ts) mutants and a revertant in the process of cold-adaptation of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to a monkey kidney cell line. The complete sequences of wild type (wt) virus, two ts mutants, and the revertant were compared and variations linked to phenotypes were mapped. A single amino acid reversion (L 294 -to-Q) in the S protein is sufficient to abrogate the ts phenotype. Interestingly, unlike wt virus, the revertant grows well at and below 32 jC, the permissive temperature, as it carries other mutations in multiple genes that might be associated with the cold-adaptation phenotype. If the two ts mutants were allowed to enter cells at 32 jC, the S protein was synthesized, core-glycosylated and at least partially modified at 40 jC. However, compared with wt virus and the revertant, no infectious particles of these ts mutants were assembled and released from the ts mutant-infected cells at 40 jC. Evidence presented demonstrated that the Q 294 -to-L 294 mutation, located at a highly conserved domain of the S1 subunit, might hamper processing of the S protein to a matured 180-kDa, endo-glycosidase H-resistant glycoprotein and the translocation of the protein to the cell surface. Consequently, some essential functions of the S protein, including mediation of cell-to-cell fusion and its incorporation into virions, were completely abolished.

We find that persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of M. schreibersii, on cross-species mixing with M. myotis, and on survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity. The virus would not persist in the single colony of M. myotis. Our study provides for the first time epidemiological estimates for EBLV-1 progression in M. schreibersii. Our approach can be readily adapted to other zoonoses of public health concern where long-range migration and habitat sharing may play an important role.\n","Score:
