            " A vaccine, providing active and protective immunity against a target disease, contains an agent that originated from and/or resembles a disease-causing microorganism. It is often made from a weakened or inactivated microbe, its toxins, or one of its nucleotides, peptides or proteins. Vaccines can be prophylactic to ameliorate or better prevent the effects of a wild-type pathogen, or therapeutic against likely cancers. To date, the World Health Organization lists twenty-seven preventable infections for which vaccines are available [1] -far less than what our society needs.\n",
            " Vaccination, a process of introducing foreign antigenic material(s) in order to activate a host immune system, has been a key strategy to control diseases and improve quality of life in humans and animals. Despite the presence of some successful vaccines, many novel and modified diseases including Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, coronavirus diseases [middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)], dengue fever, Marburg disease, malaria, and tuberculosis are in need of effective vaccines together with qualified adjuvants. While traditional adjuvants such as alum have been exclusively employed clinically to promote humoral responses, recent developments in adjuvant research have identified molecules, which are pathogen-associated molecular patterns, a few chemical compounds, and agonists of toll-like receptors, all of which induce strong immune responses.\n",
            " With great advancements in the area of material science, a new era of innovative strategies for vaccine design has arrived, enabling the precise delivery of vaccines, the enhanced role of vaccine adjuvants, an increase in the sparing effect, better stabilization, and slow release at the induction site. Nanomaterials that modified to trigger antigen-specific immune responses could be categorized into liposomes and lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, virus-like particles, self-assembled proteins, and carbon-based nanoparticles (carbon nanotubes and graphenes). In the Special Issue, entitled 'Nanoparticles to Improve the Efficacy of Vaccine' in the Pharmaceutics (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics/special_ issues/Nanoparticles_Vaccines), we draw attention to the advanced platforms and technologies using nanomaterials in order to produce the best outcomes in terms of vaccination and immunological memory.\n",
            " Kim et al. [2] described a method to improve the battle against intracellular bacterial or viral infections, and malignant tumors by various vaccination schemes, using physicochemical characteristics that target antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In particular, the improvement of an unconventional type of antigen presentation, called 'cross-presentation' in APCs when treated with certain nanomaterials for antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses, was discussed [3] . The authors focused on the mechanisms of two major intracellular pathways that nano-sized vaccines harness for cross-presentation, namely endosomal swelling and rupture, and membrane fusion. These processes allow exogenous antigens exported from phagosomes into the cytosol, followed by loading on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, triggering the clonal expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.\n",
            " Barnowski et al. [4] discussed nano-vaccines in the form of virus-like particles (VLPs), which share structural identities with their wild-type viruses, allowing B cells to face the natural conformation of the virus. The authors concentrated on the use of flagellin, a potent inducer of innate immunity via toll-like receptor 5, as an adjuvant to formulate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based nanoparticle B cell-targeting vaccines that display either the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) or a model antigen, hen egg lysozyme (HEL). They postulated that, in the context of VLP-based B cell nano-vaccines, flagellin may outcompete against a less immunogenic antigen, while, in combination with a strong immunogen, the adjuvanticity of flagellin dominates over its immunogenicity.\n",
            " Kang et al. [5] introduced a VLP vaccine containing Rhoptry organelle proteins (ROP)4 and/or ROP13 secreted by Toxoplasma gondii together with influenza M1. It was intriguing that upon challenge via the oral route, mice immunized with ROP(4 + 13) VLPs elicited higher levels of T. gondii-specific IgG and IgA responses in fecal, urine, intestine and vaginal samples in accordance with CD4+ T, CD8+ T cells, and germinal center B cell responses when compared with other vaccines, ROP4 VLPs, ROP13 VLPs, and ROP4+ROP13 VLPs. Thus, the article shed light on important insights and potential strategies for the design of a vaccine using the T. gondii ROPs and VLP system.\n",
            " Viyayan et al. [6] discussed biomimetic nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver vaccines for the treatment of diseases including HIV, malaria, some tumors and bacterial diseases due to their beneficial advantages such as improved antigen stability, targeted delivery, long-time controlled release and evasion of immune responses. They covered four kinds of biomimetic NPs for the delivery of vaccines. The first was liposomes, obtained by the dispersion of phospholipids in water, because they display high antigen loading and co-delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic antigens. The second was NPs coated with cell membranes from red blood cells, leukocytes, cytotoxic T-cells, NK cells, platelets, macrophages or cancer cells, because they preserve the physicochemical properties of the core synthetic NPs and maintain the cellular composition on their membrane shell. The third was self-assembled proteins, because they play diverse physiological roles and mimic natural microbe architectures. The fourth was virus-like NPs containing noninfectious subsets of viruses, because they assemble without containing any viral RNA.\n",
            " Sartorius et al. [7] described the possibility of filamentous bacteriophages (FBs), prepared by phage display technology, as nature-made NPs to deliver therapeutic vaccines, because lytic bacteriophages have been used as antibacterial materials in several clinical trials due to their safe and inexpensive therapeutic behavior, where the FBs enter the blood vessels easily, owing to their nano size, and exhibit high-density antigen expression. The authors showed the induction of specific cytotoxic T cell responses to HLA-A2-restricted and hepatitis B virus epitopes due to the ability of the filamentous rod, internalized into APCs. It seems likely that the targeted delivery of these NPs in new-generation vaccines against tumors such as melanoma and mastocytoma might be realized, although clinical trials are necessary to establish their safety in humans.\n",
            " Lim et al. [8] described nano delivery systems for the improvement of the enhanced gene expression of DNA vaccines that provide potent humoral and cell-mediated responses. They pointed out the limitations of their clinical applications, which present hurdles in their delivery to targeted immune cells, although none have been approved for clinical use thus far. The authors discussed the advantages and weaknesses of polymeric NPs, lipid NPs, hybrid lipid-polymer NPs, inorganic NPs, virus-like NPs and protein-based NPs in the delivery of DNA vaccines. DNA vaccine platform technology would have a high chance to be successful in clinical application if the better adjuvants and/or the encoded antigens were selected properly.\n",
            " Tan et al. [9] discussed norovirus capsid protein-derived NPs and polymers obtained by homotypically and/or heterotypically self-assembled mechanisms through bioengineering norovirus capsid shell (S) and protruding (P) domains, making them efficient vaccine candidates against noroviruses because they are easily produced, highly stable, they elicit strong host immune responses and several chimeric S 60 and P 24 NPs as well as P domain-derived polymers, as shown in other virus vaccine candidates such as rotavirus, influenza virus, EV 71, HIV-1, Alzheimer, and astrovirus diseases. It may be expected that P 24 NPs and polymers function as multifunctional P domain-based oligomer vaccine platforms displaying foreign antigens.\n",
            " There are two articles describing the importance of adjuvants. Park et al. [10] described a novel adjuvant in the form of a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) nano-structure that can stimulate both Th1 and Th2 responses. The authors claimed that neither adverse side effects such as hematological and serum biochemical parameters, nor IgE and anti-nuclear antibodies, which are markers of autoimmune disease, was found, and postulated that this ssRNA nanostructure may be an alternative choice over traditional adjuvants. Sharma et al. [11] discussed the possibility of zinc oxide (ZnO)-based nanocomposites as vaccine adjuvants and the application of cancer immunotherapeutics because of their biocompatibility, unique physicochemical properties, cost-effective mass production, intrinsic adjuvant-like properties and immunomodulatory function. The authors introduced the effects of diverse formulations and compositions on the efficiency of antigen delivery and immunogenicity by augmenting antigen processing, enhancing antigen stability and controlling the release of antigens. They described that the immunomodulatory effects of these innate immune cells were mediated by intracellular Zn 2+ dissolution in the lysosomes after the phagocytosis of particles and the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines and the activation of immune cells. Furthermore, they discussed the possibility of the enhancement of anti-cancer immunity when combined with tumor-specific antigens into ZnO NPs, although the potential toxicity and biodistribution of the ZnO NPs during in vivo studies should be thoroughly verified.\n",
            " As vaccine development pushes toward less immunogenic components such as nucleotide-based, peptide-based or sub-unit vaccines because of their side effects and the life-threatening risks of live attenuated vaccines, strategies to boost both innate and adaptive immune responses are increasingly needed. In the present Special Issue, the authors discuss the modification of nanomaterials to provide a functional and stable interface for different applications and strategies for vaccination. We hope this Special Issue, highlighting the importance and use of nanomaterials as a platform technology, will direct scientists as well as manufacturers to improve the efficacy of vaccines that are currently under development against modified or novel diseases.\n",

Within 1 year after the emergence of this novel infection that caused a global pandemic, vaccine targets were identified, vaccine constructs were created, and phase 1 through phase 3 testing was conducted. Interim results from several large-scale phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated high vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, very little is known about VE against possibly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",

Fortunately, most phase 3 trials have collected blood samples that can be used to identify SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion [1] [2] [3] [4] . For economic and logistical reasons, however, blood samples can only be drawn infrequently, such that seroconversion is only known to occur between two clinic visits that are weeks or months apart. It is more difficult to analyze such interval-censored seroconversion data than potentially right-censored symptomatic disease data, especially when VE changes over time. (An event time is said to be interval-censored if it is only known to lie in a time interval; an event time is said to be potentially right-censored if it is either observed exactly or known to be longer than the duration of follow-up [5] .) Additional challenges arise when community transmission varies over time and when participants are vaccinated on different dates because of either staggered enrollment of participants or crossover of placebo participants to the vaccine arm before the end of the trial. SARS-CoV-2 infection is commonly diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasal swabs. Most phase 3 trials have collected nasal swabs at the enrollment and crossover visits [1] [2] 4] . However, such infrequent swab samples will miss many infections, because a person may be RT-PCR positive for only a few days or weeks after infection [6] . Some phase 3 trials have taken nasal swabs more frequently (e.g., twice a week) on a subset of participants, and the newly launched Prevent COVID U study takes nasal swabs every day; however, frequent RT-PCR testing increases trial cost. How does the RT-PCR testing schedule affect the estimation of VE against infection (defined as viral RNA above a minimum threshold)?\n",
            " In this article, we show how to evaluate potentially waning VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection -defined by seroconversion or detectable viral RNA -using blood or nasal samples taken at varying levels of frequency under the conditions of time-varying community transmission, staggered enrollment of participants, and possible crossover of placebo volunteers to the vaccine arm before the end of the study. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies mimicking the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial [1] and the Prevent COVID U study. In addition, we investigate how the frequency of diagnostic tests and the characteristics (blinded versus unblinded, priority-dependent versus priority-independent) of crossover affect the precision of VE estimation. Figure 1 shows the blood sampling schedules for several phase 3 vaccine trials. For the three vaccines that have received FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), blood samples are also taken at the crossover visits [1] [2] 4] .\n",
            " We are interested in time to SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed by seroconversion, which is only known to occur between two blood draws and is thus interval-censored. We allow the risk of infection to vary over the calendar time and to depend on baseline risk factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, race, occupation, and health conditions; we allow the effect of vaccine on infection to depend on the time elapsed since vaccination.\n",
            " We consider three measures of VE as a function of time elapsed since vaccination: (1) VE h (t) is the percentage reduction in the hazard rate or instantaneous risk of infection at time t; (2) VE a (t) is the percentage reduction in the attack rate or cumulative incidence of infection over the time period (0, t]; and (3) VE a (t 1 , t 2 ) is the percentage reduction in the attack rate over the time period (t 1 , t 2 ]. Note that VE h (t) and VE a (t) pertain to instantaneous and cumulative vaccine effects, respectively, and that VE a (t) is a special case of 4 All rights reserved.

If the vaccine effect is constant over time, then the three VE measures are equivalent (provided that the infection rate is low) [7] .\n",
            " In Supplementary Appendix 1, we formulate the above ideas through an adaptation of the well-known Cox [8] regression model, in which each participant's time to infection is measured from the start of the clinical trial, and the hazard ratio of infection for vaccine versus placebo depends on the time elapsed since vaccination. Because of staggered enrollment and staggered crossover, the serum sampling time points are scattered randomly over time, providing valuable information about the distribution of the infection time. We express VE h and VE a as appropriate functions of the time-varying hazard ratio. We derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the time-varying hazard ratio based on the interval-censored infection time data and provide the corresponding estimators of VE h and VE a .\n",
            " The above framework also applies to RT-PCR tests of nasal swabs. Because an infected person is RT-PCR positive for a shorter period of time than they are seropositive (days/weeks versus months) [6, [9] [10] , nasal swabbing needs to be done more frequently than serum sampling in order to capture the infections defined by detectable viral RNA. With very frequent RT-PCR, time to detectable viral RNA may be treated as a potentially right-censored event time. In our framework, potentially right-censored data is a special case of interval-censored data, with the exactly observed event time lying within an interval of one day.\n",
            " We conducted a series of simulation studies mimicking the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial [1] (Supplementary Appendix 2.1). We used a total of 40,000 participants who enter the trial at a constant rate over a 4-month period and are randomly assigned to vaccine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. To reflect the increase of COVID-19 cases since last summer and the downward trend this spring, we let the risk of infection increase over the first 7 months and decrease afterward. In addition, we let the risk of infection depend strongly on priority tier.\n",
            " As in the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial [1] , the vaccine in our simulation received an EUA from FDA at the 5th month, after which placebo participants are sequentially crossed over 5 to the vaccine arm. We considered:\n",
            " Priority-dependent crossover. Crossover starts at month 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 of the study for participants with priority tier of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, respectively, each participant's waiting time for the clinic visit following the exponential distribution with mean of 0.5 month.\n",
            " Priority-independent crossover. Crossover starts at month 6 of the study for all participants, with the waiting time following the exponential distribution with mean of 0.5 month.\n",
            " Note that crossover spreads over a longer time period under priority-dependent crossover than under priority-independent crossover.\n",
            " We considered both blinded and unblinded crossover. At blinded crossover, placebo participants receive the vaccine and vaccine participants receive the placebo; none of them are aware of the order of their treatments. At unblinded crossover, participants are notified of their original treatment assignments, and placebo recipients are vaccinated. In both types of crossover, all participants are followed until the time of analysis, which is 10.5 months since trial initiation. To avoid bias due to behavioral confounding, we discarded the data collected after unblinded crossover.\n",
            " As shown in Figure 1 , blood samples were scheduled to be drawn on Day 1, Day 22, Day 52 and Day 209 (during the first year) in the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial [1] . In our simulation, we allowed for small random deviations from the schedule. Blood samples were also drawn at the crossover visits. Because of staggered enrollment and staggered crossover, serum sampling points were scattered randomly over the study period, making it possible to estimate time-varying VE.\n",
            " We also simulated a design under which there is no crossover before the time of analysis.\n",
            " Without crossover, placebo participants stay on placebo longer than with crossover, providing more information about long-term placebo-controlled VE. However, because crossover is one of the serum sampling points, there are fewer sampling points and thus fewer antibody tests under no crossover than under crossover.\n",

We refer to these two situations as constant VE and waning VE, respectively. (Note that constant versus waning VE pertains only to the period after the first 4 weeks, when VE is ramping up.)\n",
            " In our first simulation scenario, we let VE h stay at 80% after 4 weeks, and we analyzed the resulting interval-censored data using the proposed method with a log hazard ratio that decreases linearly between weeks 0 and 4 and stays constant after week 4. For comparison, we fit the same model by treating the time of the first positive antibody test as a potentially right-censored event time and performing maximum partial likelihood estimation [5, 8] ; we refer to this approach as naive Cox regression. (Naive Cox regression estimates the same VE parameter using the same data as the proposed method, the only difference being that it converts interval-censored event times to potentially right-censored event times.) For further comparison, we implemented logistic regression by treating the seroconversion status at the last blood test before the 10.5 month mark (excluding the blood samples drawn after unblinded crossover) as a binary outcome and estimating the odds ratio of seroconversion between the vaccine and the placebo groups by the maximum likelihood estimator. Table 1 summarizes the results of these simulation studies. Using the proposed method, the VE estimates are unbiased, the standard errors are accurately estimated, and the confidence intervals have proper coverage probabilities. The standard error is lower under blinded than unblinded crossover, and lower under priority-dependent than priority-independent crossover. The standard error is slightly higher under no crossover than under blinded priority-dependent crossover. (Note that there are fewer sampling points under no crossover than under crossover.) In comparison, naive Cox regression may under-estimate or overestimate the true VE, and logistic regression always under-estimates the true VE.\n",
            " In our second simulation scenario, we let VE h stay at 80% after 4 weeks or let it decrease to 0 at 1 year. We implemented the proposed method (for interval-censored data) using a piecewise linear function for the log hazard ratio, with a change point placed at 4 weeks and with the two slopes estimated from the data. For comparison, we also implemented naive Cox regression with the same piecewise linear function for the log hazard ratio. 7 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.\n",

Tables 2-3 show the simulation results on the estimation of VE a over successive time periods under constant VE and waning VE, respectively. The proposed method yields unbiased VE a estimates, with accurate standard error estimates and proper confidence intervals in virtually all cases. Naive Cox regression yields severely biased VE a estimates. Figure 2 displays the estimation results produced by the proposed method in one of the trials simulated under waning VE. The estimated VE h and VE a curves are close to the truth, and the 95% confidence intervals nearly cover the entire true curves. As expected, the confidence intervals are the narrowest under blinded priority-dependent crossover and the widest under unblinded priority-independent crossover. In addition, the confidence intervals for VE h are wider than the confidence intervals for VE a at the right tail.\n",
            " We also conducted a series of simulation studies mimicking the Prevent COVID U study (Supplementary Appendix 2.2). A total of 12,000 participants enter the study at a constant rate over one month. Half of them are randomly selected to receive the Moderna vaccine at enrollment, and the other half get their first injection with a 4 month delay. We assumed a downward trend of infection over time; we adopted the VE patterns from the first series of simulation studies but placed the change point at 6 weeks instead of 4 weeks.\n",
            " We explored various swabbing/RT-PCR testing schedules, ranging from every day to every 2 weeks. Each participant is followed for 4 months, and the study ends at month 5, when the last enrolled participant has been followed for 4 months. We also considered a scenario where 50% of the delayed-arm participants receive outside vaccines before the end of follow-up; in the analysis, we discarded the data collected after outside vaccination. Table 4 summarizes the simulation results on the estimation of constant VE. The proposed method yields unbiased VE estimates, with accurate standard error estimates and proper confidence intervals in all cases. The standard error of the VE estimate tends to increase a little bit as RT-PCR testing becomes less frequent. There is a slight loss of precision in the VE estimates when the delayed-arm participants are allowed to receive outside vaccines. In comparison, naive Cox regression shows highly similar results to the proposed method when RT-PCR testing is performed every day; however, as RT-PCR testing becomes 8 All rights reserved.

Excluding the events within the first 6 weeks substantially reduces the precision of VE estimates. (The substantial loss of precision is due to relatively high incidence in the first 6 weeks under decreasing background incidence over time and high VE. In the setting of constant background incidence with VE of 0.6 after 4 weeks, excluding the events within the first 4 weeks incurs about 13% loss of statistical efficiency.) Table 5 presents the results on the estimation of VE a over successive time periods when VE h decreases to 0 at 1 year. The proposed method provides unbiased VE a estimates, along with proper confidence intervals. Naive Cox regression performs well when RT-PCR testing is done daily but performs poorly when RT-PCR testing is infrequent.\n",
            " We have assumed that VE ramps to an unknown peak level 4 weeks (or 6 weeks) after the first injection of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (or the Moderna vaccine). We can allow uncertainty in this change point by including several change points in the analysis or by selecting the change point through the Akaike information criterion (AIC). We evaluated these strategies by extending the simulation studies reported in Table 1 Table 6 , the first method performs very well, although the standard error is higher than using a single change point. The second method correctly selects the change point with high probability.\n",

            " The form of the model considered in this article is essentially the same as that used in our previous work on evaluating VE against symptomatic COVID-19 [7] . However, here the estimation approach is different because infection times are interval-censored rather than potentially right-censored. The proposed methodology is general enough to include potentially right-censored data as a special case and thus offers an alternative way to assess VE against symptomatic COVID-19. A major advantage of this new approach is that it provides a unified framework for studying constant versus waning VE.\n",
            " Another important contribution of this work is a careful treatment of the ramping VE after initial vaccination. The prevailing approach is not to count the events that occur within 4-6 weeks of the first injection [1] [2] . Discarding the first 4-6 weeks of follow-up data causes considerable loss of statistical efficiency, as shown in Table 4 . In the case of blinded crossover, excluding the events that occur within 4-6 weeks of crossover will further reduce statistical efficiency, whereas including all the events will result in biased VE estimates.\n",

Thus, infrequent serology will capture more infections than infrequent RT-PCR. Some asymptomatic infections never seroconvert or have transient seroconversion that may be missed by infrequent serology [9] [10] . However, those who do not seroconvert tend to be less infectious than those who do, such that missed seronegative infections may be clinically less important. Likewise, an asymptomatic infection that is RT-PCR positive for just a day or two is difficult to detect but may have little public-health relevance.\n",

In particular, investigators wish to capture potential infectiousness by measuring the peak viral load, the duration of viral shedding, and the area under the viral load curve. If detecting the presence of viral RNA were the study's only goal, then less frequent testing would be needed. The proposed methods (for interval-censored data) may be warranted in the case that a substantial number of swabs are not collected or are not usable (due to improper collection or storage).\n",
            " Blood samples and nasal swabs provide complementary information about SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral RNA can be detected sooner after infection than seroconversion, but antibody lasts longer than viral shedding [6, [9] [10] . There is considerable heterogeneity in the duration of both seropositivity and RT-PCR positivity, with the biggest driving factor being symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection [6, [9] [10] . Many studies collect both blood and nasal samples. For example, the Moderna phase 3 trial [2] performs RT-PCR testing at month 1 and at crossover in addition periodic serology. The Prevent COVID U study performs periodic (every 2 months) serology and frequent RT-PCR testing. The proposed methods can be applied to the two types of infection data separately or as a combined endpoint, depending on the objective of the analysis and the frequency of each type of test.\n",

This assumption is satisfied for planned diagnostic tests but is unlikely to hold if SARS-CoV-2 infection is detected through symptom-prompted testing. We can apply the proposed methods (for interval-censored data) to planned tests and standard Cox regression with potentially right-censored data to symptom-prompted tests. If the planned RT-PCR testing is frequent, then the data from planned and symptom-prompted RT-PCR tests can be combined and standard Cox regression for potentially right-censored data can be adopted.\n",

We also performed the logistic regression of the infection status at the last antibody test before the 10.5 month mark (excluding the blood samples drawn after unblinded crossover) on the randomization assignment and baseline covariates X, and we estimated VE by 1 minus the odds ratio of infection for vaccine versus placebo.\n",
            " We conducted a second series of simulation studies to mimic the Prevent COVID U study.\n",
            " In our simulation, a total of 12,000 participants enter the study at a constant rate over one month; half of them receive the Moderna vaccine at enrollment and the other half 4 months later. We generated the infection time T from model (1) without X and with log λ 0 (t) = −4.0 − 0.2t. We assumed the same VE patterns as in the first series of simulation studies, but the change point was set at 6 weeks instead of 4 weeks.\n",
            " We investigated various swabbing/RT-PCR testing schedules, ranging from every day to every 2 weeks. All participants are followed for 4 months, and the study ends at month 5. In addition, we considered a scenario in which placebo participants may receive vaccines outside of the study 1 month after enrollment. We assumed that the time to outside vaccination follows the Weibull distribution with shape parameter of 3 and scale parameter of 4, such that the cumulative probability of outside vaccination is approximately 50%.\n",
            " For each simulated dataset, we analyzed the data in the same way as in the first series of simulation studies. Specifically, we implemented both the proposed method and its rightcensored data counterpart, to be referred to as naive Cox regression. We discarded the data collected on placebo participants after they received outside vaccines. 25 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " The isolation of the human adenovirus in the early 1950s was an important step in our understanding of this common pathogen, which is typically asso ciated with mild, selflimiting infections. Advances in molecular and cellular biology in the 1990s permitted the use of human and nonhuman adenoviruses as nonreplicating vectors for the delivery of vaccines and therapeutic genes. The advantages of adenoviral vector vaccines include their proven ability to drive immune activation, low production costs and high stability, par ticularly for longterm storage. These vaccines have been widely evaluated in cancer trials and also used for vaccination against human infections, such as HIV, Ebola virus and Zika virus. Given their history of effi cacy and safety, two adenoviral vector vaccines were rapidly developed for SARSCoV2: one produced by Johnson and Johnson using HAdV26 and another by AstraZeneca/COVIShield using the chimpanzeebased ChAdOx1 vector. Metaanalysis documented the clinical effectiveness of these vaccines as well as their ability to induce high antibody titres and T cell reactivity against SARSCoV2 (ref. 1 ). Although the safety data from clini cal trials were reassuring, given the limited sample size, these trials would not have identified very rare serious adverse effects (SAEs) such as vaccineinduced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).\n",
            " Shortly after the emergence of SARSCoV2, it became apparent that individuals infected with the virus showed a high risk of thromboembolic events. In a metaanalysis of some 8,000 patients with COVID19, arterial and venous thromboembolic complications were observed in 2% and 21% of patients, respectively, which significantly increased the risk of death 2 . It is noteworthy that many of the arterial and venous thrombi associated with VITT are anatomically unusual. However, other clots resemble the thromboembolic complications observed in unvac cinated patients with COVID19. The mechanistic basis of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID19 is still unclear, but there is evidence of generalized activation of the coagulation cascade. In a study of ten patients with acute COVID19, we found that a number of the patients had immune complexes in their plasma that activated platelets 3 . Some of these patients also had elevated levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) 3 .\n",
            " The widespread use of adenoviral vector vaccines for COVID19 began in late 2020 and had an immediate positive impact in reducing severe illness and death. However, by early April 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had received reports of atypical thrombi following vaccination and concluded that there was a signal of disproportionality. Initial reports described atypical cerebral thrombi, especially in young women and occurring days to several weeks after vaccination with COVID19 adenoviral vector vaccines.\n",
            " The reports, often in young people, of unexpected venous or arterial clots post vaccination were distinct from the thromboses observed in patients with COVID19 infection. These events were accompanied by low levels of platelets and were highly reminiscent of the early reports describing heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) 4 . Heparin, a longchain anionic glycosaminoglycan, can bind to PF4 -a small positively charged protein -causing atrisk individuals to form antibodies to the PF4-heparin complexes 4 . These antibodies can crosslink and form immune complexes capable of binding to platelet FcγRIIa receptors, which leads to activation of platelets and other cells and triggers coagulation.\n",
            " Towards an understanding of VITT Very few clinical conditions cause both arterial and venous thrombi in unusual locations, accompanied by thrombocytopenia and generalized activation of the coagulation cascade. VITT mirrors HIT with regard to these clinical and laboratory characteristics 4 . Within weeks of the first VITT reports, three different groups all reported the presence of antibodies to PF4 in patients with VITT, but not in vaccinated persons without VITT 5-7 . But a major difference between HIT and VITT www.nature.com/nri 0123456789();:\n",
            " was apparent -specifically, that patients with VITT had not received heparin. To date, it is not possible to deter mine whether the two currently available adenoviral vector COVID19 vaccines pose a difference in the risk of developing VITT. Complexities in reporting and lack of serological confirmation adds to the uncertainty. In our laboratory, the majority of patients who are suspected of having VITT turn out to be serologically negative and do not have VITT. This means that at least some clinically diagnosed episodes of VITT are not causally related to the vaccination. Adding to the difficulties in understanding VITT and its association with adenoviral vector vaccines is a patient who had VITT following an mRNA vaccine 8 . It remains uncertain whether this was a causal or a coincidental association.\n",
            " Our laboratory has studied the epitopes on PF4 that are targeted by the antibodies in patients with HIT. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis to identify antibodybinding sites, we found that patients with HIT have a polyclonal response targeting multiple amino acids on the PF4 tetramer 9 . We used a similar approach to study the epitopes on PF4 that constitute the VITT antibodybinding sites and identified a unique and con served VITT antibodybinding site on the PF4 tetramer made up of eight amino acids, within the heparin bind ing site 10 . In contrast to what is seen in HIT, the VITT antibodies did not require heparin for immune complex formation and FcγRIIadependent platelet activation. Consistently, we found that therapeutic doses of hep arin inhibited the reaction, which can be explained by the overlapping binding region on PF4 between VITT antibodies and heparin 10 . The question then became: is it possible that the PF4 antibodies in patients who develop VITT crosslink PF4 tetramers on their own, thereby forming immune complexes capable of acti vating platelets? Using biolayer interferometry, we C o m m e n t In most people, administration of an adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine induces antibodies to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and protects the recipient against COVID-19 (steps 1-4). In rare cases (step 5), vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) antibodies are induced that can bind to platelet factor 4 (PF4) and form immune complexes that activate platelets (steps 5-7). This leads to pathological activation of clotting cascades and a fall in platelet counts (steps 8-9). VITT-associated clots have been described in the brains, lungs, abdomen, liver and legs (step 10). Image courtesy of Christy Groves, adapted by S. Bradbrook/Springer Nature Limited.\n",
            " documented that, first, patients with VITT antibodies have a strong antibody response to PF4 (a measure of the amount of antibody produced to an antigen) and, sec ond, VITTassociated antibodies show a similar dissoci ation rate from PF4 to HITassociated antibodies 10 . We also noted that VITTassociated antibodies show higher binding to PF4 than to PF4-heparin complexes. These observations demonstrate that VITT antibodies have sufficient binding strength (avidity) to form immune complexes with PF4 and to crosslink FcγRIIa receptors on platelets and consequently activate platelets, produc ing procoagulantrich microparticles and activating the coagulation cascade ( fig. 1) .\n",
            " These observations provided a framework for better understanding the clotting disorder of VITT following vaccination with an adenoviral vector vaccine. The rapid formation, literally within days, of the IgG autoanti bodies suggests an anamnestic response. The mecha nism by which the vaccines induce VITTassociated antibodies remains unknown. One possibility is that PF4 might complex with electronegative surface charges on the adenoviral vector rendering it immunogenic, in a similar manner to how it can bind other polyanions, such as heparin, DNA and bacteria.\n",
            " It is likely that adenoviral vector vaccines will continue to be needed around the world. Several steps should be taken. First, our data emphasized that VITT is fre quently clinically overdiagnosed, making a rare disorder appear more common. Standard serological tests should be required to confirm the diagnosis. Second, until we have developed more effective treatments for VITT, the focus should shift to modification of the vaccine to prevent VITT. Just as pharmacological strategies modi fying heparin molecules progressively reduced the risk of HIT, it is likely that modifications to the adenoviral vector vaccines can lead to even safer vaccines. A better understanding of the components of the vaccine that trigger the formation of autoantibodies to PF4 should be an early focus.\n",

            " The ideal scenario for efficacious vaccination requires initiation of a potent immune response by a vaccine formulated to resemble the situation of the natural infection [1, 2] . In reality, vaccines are manufactured to resemble as close as possible the pathogen in question, but lacking a pathogenic nature; elaboration of this approach has sought to dissect the vaccine into the most pertinent immunogenic component(s) for promotion of protective immune defences. With virus vaccines based on the whole virus, approaches have included the application of attenuated variants as well as inactivated antigen. Moreover, a study of the evolution in vaccine design to combat viral infections shows how manipulations of the vaccine composition have increased the success rate for generating efficacious vaccines. An appreciation of these approaches, and their evolution, shows three main elements essential for successful vaccination. (i) The antigenic characteristics of the vaccine itself. (ii) The mode of vaccine delivery; until the last decade often ignored or relegated to the position of an ''also-ran''. This has a particular significance in that efficient vaccine delivery relates directly to vaccine proficiency at targeting the host immune system. (iii) Adjuvant application, a major tool and often critically important component for an efficacious vaccine. This is a major provider of the ''danger'' signals necessary for activating the innate responses essential for promoting efficacious specific immune defences. Although viruses and bacterial components can themselves provide danger signals, these may require efficient replication of the pathogen, which is not possible with inactivated or subunit vaccines. Alternatively, only a week danger signal may be provided due to a low-level interaction with the appropriate receptors, or the presence of inhibitory signals.\n",
            " Overall, the vaccine must be efficiently delivered to the appropriate compartments of the immune system, leading to the correct signalling of the immune system to process the vaccine, and promotion of efficacious vaccination. Accordingly, an important issue for vaccine design is consideration of the ligands carried by a number of pathogens, which interact with receptors on cells of the immune system. Adjuvants also contain components interacting with immune cells, particularly of the innate immune defences. In both respects, the involvement of dendritic cells (DC) is crucial, due to their role as central players in the immune defence development (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). DC ensure both appropriate recognition of danger signals and correct processing of the vaccine antigen, promoting efficacious development of innate and acquired immune defences [3] .\n",
            " In order to appreciate how vaccines can be targeted to the immune system, for enhancing their efficacy, it is necessary to Developmental Based on the promise for the rational design of vaccine platforms, the current review will provide an update on particle-based vaccines of both viral and synthetic origin, giving examples of recombinant virus carriers such as adenoviruses and biodegradable particulate carriers. The viral carriers carry pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), used by the original virus for targeting DC, and are particularly efficient and versatile gene delivery vectors. Efforts in the field of synthetic vaccine carriers are focussing on decorating the particle surface with ligands for DC receptors such as heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan structures, integrins, Siglecs, galectins, C-type lectins and toll-like receptors. The emphasis of this review will be placed on targeting the porcine immune system, but reference will be made to advances with murine and human vaccine delivery systems where information on DC targeting is available.\n",

            " appreciate the central role played by the DC therein, because these are critical targets for vaccine delivery ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Most inactivated, protein-based vaccines induce acquired (specific) immune responses involving MHC Class II-restricted T-helper (Th) and B lymphocytes: Antibody-dependent immune defences. An additional defence important for removing infected or ''altered self'' host cells is that involving MHC Class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, although these are less evident following vaccination with inactivated vaccines. Overall, the central and key player for inducing efficacious acquired immunity is the DC [4] . These areas are covered in detail elsewhere [3] . Following endocytosis of the vaccine, DC process the antigen towards presentation of derived peptides to T lymphocytes (in association with either MHC Class II or Class I molecules). Advances in murine and rat immunology have shown that DC may ''deliver'' antigen in a more intact form to B lymphocytes, releasing the antigen to stimulate the B lymphocytes [5] . Furthermore, DC release cytokines of major importance for B lymphocyte activity: type I interferon (IFN), IL-6, IL-12 and BAFF [6] . Efficacious vaccination is dependent on the efficiency with which the vaccine interacts with the DC subsets. This raises the question of vaccine delivery, which will influence how both conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) -as well as monocytes and macrophages -become involved. DC possess a broad spectrum of cell surface receptors involved in the initiation, promotion and execution of immune responses [7] ; importantly, the expression patterns for these receptors vary between cDC and pDC. Among these are the TLR, scavenger receptors, and C-type lectin receptors (Fig. 1 ). All are important pattern recognition receptors (PRR), recognizing PAMP on pathogens -and indeed antigens, adjuvants and vaccines -essential for the development of innate immune responses and defences [8, 9] . With PAMP binding to PRR on the DC surface, they also offer potential as targets for vaccine delivery. Ligation of particular PRR evokes rapid activation of the cell, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release and upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules on leukocytes, as seen with DC and macrophages [9] . With other PRR, such as certain C-type lectin receptors, their ligation leads to enhanced endocytosis. For DC acting as antigen-presenting cells (APC), the ligation can also lead to induction of DC maturation-an essential step licensing these cells to induce potent effector as well as memory immune responses [10, 11] . A good example of PAMP ligating PRR to activate cDC is seen with bacterial lipopeptides and lipoproteins recognized by heterodimeric TLR2-TLR1 or TLR2-TLR6. Lipopeptides deliver a strong activation signal to DC, which is the basis of their potent activity as immunoadjuvants in vitro and in vivo, at least in rodents and primates [12] [13] [14] . C-type lectin PRR such as the multilectin DEC-205 receptor and the mannose receptor are more involved in enhanced endocytosis. Ligation of these receptors has also shown potential for vaccine targeting and activation of DC [15] . In the murine system, ligation of DEC-205 enhances receptor-dependent endocytic processes leading to efficient recycling of the antigen through late endosomes-such processing is likely to enhance antigen presentation to CD4 + helper T lymphocytes. In contrast, ligation of the mannose receptor tends more to promote recycling through the peripheral endosomal compartment.\n",
            " These few examples of how targeting specific receptors on DC can result in a different form of signalling to the DC is an important consideration for targeting vaccines to the immune system. Dependent on the receptor being targeted, the antigen may be ''delivered'' to different compartments of the DC, with important consequences for the type of immune response induced. Consequently the following sections will use selected examples of vaccine developments to demonstrate how vaccine may be targeting the immune system. When possible, examples will be given for the porcine field. This will be elaborated using more general advances in immunology characterizing the interaction of DC with vaccine carriers promoting interaction with surface receptors on the DC.\n",
            " An important element in the concept of recombinant vector vaccines is selecting immunogenic structures of the pathogen to replace the pathogen itself, ensuring its efficient delivery to the immune system as in the form of a biologically active carrier. This approach helps reduce the risks associated with handling the live pathogen, and the problems of incomplete inactivation or reversion of attenuation. The approach must ensure that the vaccine retains a high level of immunogenicity, which is more difficult to achieve with subunit or protein/peptide vaccines.\n",
            " Viruses possess natural ligands for binding to receptors of the cells they infect; receptors have been identified for some viruses employed for vaccine design, but not for all (Fig. 2) . Although Fig. 1 . Examples of known receptors on DC, which may have potential for targeting vaccines, based on work performed with vaccine targeting to DC, or from analyses of the ligands with which the receptors interact. many viruses infect epithelial cells, a large number can interact directly with DC, in particular monocytotropic viruses. Also a restricted infection of epithelial cells can be immunogenic after antigen ''transfer'' to the DC, following exocytosis from the producing cell.\n",
            " A disadvantage of viral vectors is the immune response against the vector itself, which restricts its application in terms of multiple use for different vaccines. However, the formation of antibody complexes with the vaccine can have certain advantages in terms of the immune reaction induced. For example, FcgRI-targeting of adenovirus vector can enhance vector-mediated gene transfer into human DC, leading to an increased immune response against the vector-encoded antigen [16] .\n",
            " Vaccinia virus was one of the earliest viruses employed as a vector for the generation of recombinant vaccines, generally for all species [17] . In 1986, a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing influenza virus haemagglutinin was tested in cattle, sheep and poultry [18] . On the porcine front, a vaccinia virus was employed to generate a recombinant vaccine expressing pseudorabies virus (PRV) glycoprotein gp50 [19] . An overview of reports on vaccinia virus recombinants employed as vectors for porcine vaccines is given in Table 1 , including the recent application of the recombinant modified Ankara vaccinia virus [20] (Table 1a) . [22] Related to the application of vaccinia vectors, swine poxvirus has also been proposed as the basis for a porcine recombinant vaccine [21] (Table 1b) . Although it has not been tested as a porcine vaccine vector, swine poxvirus has clear potential, for example from the work with feline leukaemia virus antigens and infection of porcine cells [22] (Table 1b) . Both fowlpox virus and parapoxvirus (ORF virus) have been employed as vectors for potential porcine vaccines (Table 1b) . Interestingly, the ORF virus vector also displays adjuvant potential for inducing IFN responses [23] (Table 1b) .\n",
            " Whether vaccinia virus can enter porcine DC leading to viral DNA replication or transcription is uncertain. From studies using mouse and human cells, it appears that the virus does interact with DC [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] ; to date, the receptor involved has not been defined, although it is possible to propose potential candidates (Fig. 2) . Certainly, vaccinia virus is less efficient at binding to human DC compared with a human epithelial cell line [24] . Jenne et al. [25] also demonstrated difficulties for vaccinia virus to replicate in human DC -immature as well as mature -leading to an abortive infection in which proteins under control of the late promoters were lacking. Nevertheless, a certain level of protein translation does occur in DC, which could promote antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation.\n",
            " As mentioned above, DC processing of the antigen alone is inadequate for efficient promotion of immune responses; induction of DC maturation is also required, typically through ''danger'' signalling. With respect to vaccine vectors, there is a reported absence of vaccinia virus-induced maturation in the DC [24] . Moreover, a reduced expression of certain costimulatory molecules -CD80 and CD83, but not CD86 or MHC -on the virusinfected DC, together with a reduced capacity for stimulating T-cell proliferation was observed [25] . The modified vaccinia virus Ankara was even more problematic for human DC in terms of reduced cellular protein synthesis leading to increased apoptosis in the virus-infected DC [27] . While these latter events would be advantageous to the development of cytotoxic immunity, through cross-presentation of the apoptotic cells, the results overall query the value of direct interaction of vaccinia virus vectors with DC. Yates and Alexander-Miller [28] showed that when vaccinia virus infected immature DC, there was no induction of maturation, yielding DC incapable of initiating T-cell activation. It was only when mature DC were infected with vaccinia virus that functional antigen-presenting cells were generated, capable of activating vaccinia virus-specific CD8 + lymphocytes. Moreover, Nagorsen et al. [26] noted that the efficiency of the vaccine virus vectordelivered vaccine was dependent on the HLA haplotype and the epitopes carried by the vaccine.\n",
            " Non-transmissible pseudorabies virus vectors have been created by deletion of the essential gD required for PRV penetration [29] . Considering that this virus can still spread from cell-to-cell, a biologically safer quadruple glycoprotein-deleted PRV lacking gG, gI and gE was generated [30] . With such PRV vectors, vaccines have been generated encoding proteins from a number of viruses Table 2 .\n",
            " Although the potential of PRV vectors for targeting DC has not been investigated, the reported capacity of PRV to infect and replicate efficiently in macrophages would indicate a tropism for monocytic cells including DC [31] (Fig. 2) . Unfortunately, it has been reported that PRV infection of macrophages is associated with immunological malfunction [32, 33] . In contrast, PRV was seen to be a potent activator of porcine pDC [34] , which would be beneficial for its use as vector. Such results show that the interaction of PRV with cDC and pDC needs further characterization before one can propose this as a vaccine delivery vehicle targeting DC. Indeed, the above results on both poxviruses and PRV demonstrate the need to understand the type and status of the DC being targeted by a vaccine carrier, to ensure the appropriate processing leading to activation of effector immune defences.\n",
            " Adenovirus has been receiving much attention as a vector for delivery of vaccines [35] [36] [37] . Recombinant replication-defective adenoviruses have been generated for a number of porcine pathogens (Table 3 ). These efforts have employed primarily human adenovirus serotype 5 or porcine adenovirus serotype 3, although canine adenovirus type 2 has also been tested. Adenovirus-vectored antigens have also been produced in cell culture and goat milk, for application as recombinant vaccines rather than vectored vaccines [37, 38] .\n",
            " Although porcine adenovirus might appear to be the more obvious candidate of choice, application of human adenovirus does have high potential. Torres et al. [39] analysed the efficiency of this vector for targeting cells and organs of vaccinated pigs. They found adenovirus antigen associated with epithelial cells of bronchioles, macrophages, type II pneumocytes, and follicular dendritic cells. However, it was unclear whether these adenovirus-positive cells were accommodating replicating virus -therefore with the potential for producing the heterologous antigen in a vectored vaccine -or endocytosed antigen produced elsewhere.\n",
            " Human adenovirus have also been engineered to express immunostimulatory cytokines, for promoting innate resistance against infection. A successful example of this is vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV); a recombinant human adenovirus expressing FMDV P1 capsid precursor protein and 3C protease was co-administered with an adenovirus expressing porcine IFN-a [40] . This is particularly intriguing considering the importance of type I IFN to the maturation of cDC and in the development of innate responses following vaccination [41] .\n",
            " The mechanism by which adenoviruses may interact with DC can be inferred from studies employing human monocytes/ macrophages, human cell lines and murine bone marrow-derived DC (Fig. 2) . Moreover, the immunomodulatory capacity of adenoviruses has been demonstrated using murine bone mar- [194] row-derived DC, in terms of maturation of the DC [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] , phenotypic modification [42, 47, 48] , and cytokine induction [42, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . Related to this, Miller et al. [43] noted that the induced maturation of DC depended on virus entry rather than transcription of the viral genome, while Molinier-Frenkel et al. [44] identified the penton capsomer and the fibre protein (and its knob domain) as major inducers of DC maturation. Bontkes et al. [50] found that adenovirus alone was poor at infecting human pDC. In contrast, Basner-Tschakarjan et al. [46] were able to transduce murine bone marrow-derived (with Flt3-L) cDC and pDC with adenovirus, leading to cell maturation and production of IFN-a. This effect was observed in the pDC only when TLR9-dependent signalling was engaged. Such discriminatory results from adenovirus interaction with DC subsets may relate to the receptors required by different adenovirus serotypes, or differences between rodents and humans (see the comment in the next paragraph concerning CD46 expression). Interestingly, the targeting of adenovirus to human DC was enhanced when the virus was engineered to express CD40L on its capsid [51] . Bontkes et al. [50] also used a CD40 targeting approach to improve virus interaction with the DC; although this did not improve transduction efficiency, it did increase the maturation of the pDC.\n",
            " The most straightforward approach for targeting vaccines to DC would be to employ virus vectors known to interact with a particular receptor on the DC. In this context, adenoviruses have a clear application. Receptors have been identified on human DC, as well as human or murine monocytes and macrophages, with which particular adenoviruses can interact. However, an initial problem was realised when the major cell receptor for virus binding was characterized as the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) [52] . Despite being a widely expressed cell adhesion molecule, this receptor has not been found on DC or monocytic cell populations [53, 54] . In contrast, another receptor -CD46 -is expressed on DC [55, 56] . However, CD46 is employed by subgroup B adenoviruses such as adenovirus 35 . Subgroup C adenoviruses such as the widely applied vaccine vector adenovirus 5, as well as canine adenovirus type 2 vaccine vector, employ CAR [54] [55] [56] . Nevertheless, the work with CD46 has shown its importance as a receptor for vaccine targeting, being present on many subtypes of human DC. Interestingly, it is not expressed on murine DC [57] .\n",
            " This variation among adenovirus subtypes with respect to receptor targeting would create uncertainty about the application of vectors such as the commonly employed adenovirus 5. Yet, such vaccines have proven successful in pigs (see Table 3 ). One explanation may be that the adenovirus vector targeted cells other than DC, such as epithelial cells expressing CAR. Alternatively, the vector may have used receptors other than CAR and CD46 on DC. Integrins such as the complement receptor CR3 [58] , and glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulphate structures on the cell surface [59] may also function as adenovirus receptors. In addition, certain adenoviruses can employ a v integrins for interacting with cells, at least cell lines [60, 61] and human monocytes and macrophages [59] .\n",
            " When considering adenovirus targeting of cells, it is important to bear in mind that the virus interaction with cell surface receptors is not a single event. Adenovirus can bind to cells via its fibre protein, after which the viral penton base interacts with cellular integrins such as a v b 3 and a v b 5 to promote virus entry.\n",
            " This role of the penton base appears to be dependent on the RGD motifs in the five identical subunits, at least with cells lines [60, 61] .\n",
            " Involvement of the a v integrins may be more important for virus internalisation than for attachment to the cell [60] . Yet, modifying the viral fibre knob of adenovirus type 5 to carry an RGD motif results in enhanced infectivity for murine DC [62] . While the interaction of the virus fibre protein is clearly important for binding to cell lines, penton base interaction with a M b 2 integrin is important for binding to human monocytes and macrophages [58] .\n",
            " Akin to attachment via the fibre knob, interaction with a M b 2 integrin still required the additional step involving a v integrins for virus internalisation.\n",
            " In addition to the integrins as targets for adenovirus, interaction with cell surface glycosaminoglycan structures can occur. This may be particularly pertinent when considering that a v integrins are more efficiently expressed following activation of monocytes, macrophage or DC. Wickham et al. [59] demonstrated that adenovirus type 5 modified to carry a heparan sulphate-binding heptalysine motif were more efficient at transducing human monocytes and macrophages. A candidate heparin-binding KKTK motif was also identified in the third pseudorepeat of the fibre shaft from adenoviruses 2 and 5 [63] . Moreover, many viruses can bind to heparan sulphate structures on cells, particularly following cell culture passage of the virus as is often the case when producing vaccine viruses. However, heparan sulphate structures are rather ubiquitously expressed, and may not be ideal for enhancing DC targeting over interaction with other cell types. On the contrary, CR3 is more restricted to cells of the innate immune system, namely DC, macrophages and monocytes. Indeed, in contrast to adenoviruses type 2 and 5 (subgroup C adenoviruses), adenovirus type 3 (subgroup B) did not require heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans for binding to and infection of cell lines [63] .\n",
            " Modulation of vaccine targeting can be achieved by introducing a ligand on to the vaccine delivery vehicle, to enhance targeting of the desired receptor. Again, adenoviruses provide some interesting examples of the value in this approach. A chimeric adenovirus was created by modifying the subgroup C adenovirus type 5 to carry the subgroup B adenovirus 35 fibre antigen [55] . This increased interaction with human DC up to 100-fold. A similar approach may be achieved by applying short peptide motifs known for their capacity to interact with integrins expressed on DC, as described above in Section 3.3.3 [62] . One disadvantage with this approach is that certain motifs, such as RGD, have the potential to bind with different integrins. Nevertheless, the presence of the RGD motif in chimeric adenovirus penton bases apparently did not influence their interaction with integrins [54] , suggesting an involvement of other structures; perhaps fibre antigens carrying the KKTK motif of the adenovirus 35 would be important [55] . Indeed, Perreau et al. [54] proposed that chimeric viruses could employ the nonintegrin-binding capacity of the canine adenovirus 2 knob in combination with the capacity of the human adenovirus 5 to interact with integrins.\n",
            " How different targeting events would influence DC handling of a vaccine is dependent on the cell receptor being targeted. Indeed, human adenovirus 5 and canine adenovirus 2 appear to be endocytosed into distinct intracellular compartments [54] . The roles of different receptors leading to distinct compartmentalisation within the cell, as well as the influence of multiple receptor involvement, are important considerations when analysing the potential for targeting vaccines to DC. While there is information concerning the binding of particular vaccines to DC, there is less information on the endocytic route taken thereafter. This is unfortunate, because the endocytic process will determine if an antigen is released (for interaction with B lymphocytes), processed through MHC Class II (for Th lymphocytes), or processed via the immunoproteasome for presentation in association with MHC Class I (for Tc lymphocytes). The endocytic pathway employed will also determine if genetic information carried by a viral vector vaccine is translated into protein. These are important issues, which will be raised again later during discussion of C-type lectin receptor targeting.\n",
            " Canine parvovirus is reported to interact with the transferrin receptor (TfR) [64] (Fig. 2) . This is referred to as an asymmetric binding where only a few receptor molecules (5 AE 2 TfR dimmers) can bind per capsid. The authors suggested that the asymmetric binding of TfR might be due to the virus possessing only one unique site with the conformation for binding to the TfR. Alternatively, the binding of the virus to the TfR might induce the asymmetry. Whatever the mechanism, this binding differs from that associated with picornavirus infection, in which up to 60 sites on the icosahedron can be involved [65] .\n",
            " Numerous non-enveloped viruses, including FMDV, are known for their potential to interact with heparan sulphate structures on cell surfaces [66] [67] [68] [69] . Heparan sulphate structures on DC are important for binding cell-culture passaged FMDV, relating to vaccine viruses [70] (Fig. 2) . This virus also carries ligands for integrin receptors [71] : avb1 [72] , avb3 [73, 74] ) avb6 [71] , and avb8 [72] . However, it appears that the preferred integrins for virus binding are either not expressed or are poorly expressed on the DC [70] . Whether ligation of heparan sulphate structures is the best target remains to be elucidated.\n",
            " Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has also generated interest with respect to DC targeting. In addition, TGEV has been employed as a vaccine vector; reviewed by Enjuanes et al. [75] . TGEV efficiently induces IFN production by pDC [41, [76] [77] [78] , an ability which is independent of virus replication. Viral pseudoparticles expressing M and E proteins, and resembling intact virions, retained the interferogenic activity of the virus [79] ; neither the virus genome nor the spike (S) protein necessary for infection of cells were essential for IFN induction. The induction of IFN did require virus interaction with the cell surface, but not all virion structures were important. Relating to the above report from Baudoux et al. [79] , Riffault et al. [80] had shown that antibody against the TGEV receptor aminopeptidase N did not prevent the IFN induction; nor was antibody against surface M protein effective. Moreover, reconstructing detergent solubilised virus into virosomes did not reconstitute IFN induction capacity. The authors concluded that the induction of IFN required a complex native envelope protein structure. As such, it has been difficult to identify the receptors involved in this IFN induction, although it does seem certain that the induction is being signalled from interaction with receptors on the pDC surface. Insofar as being applicable for targeting vaccine to DC, one may employ the pseudoparticles expressing M and E proteins [79] .\n",
            " Although influenza virus per se has not been applied as a viral vector, derived virosomes (based on influenza virus envelope plus surface glycoproteins) have high potential. In this context, the virus biology is interesting in terms of DC targeting. Sialic residues on cells, particularly a-2,3 and a-2,6-linked sialic acids, are well established as receptors for influenza viruses. The efficiency of the virosomal vaccine carrier (for example: [81] [82] [83] ) would suggest that a-2,6-linked sialic acids on DC (at least murine and human DC) were the target for such vaccines. Indeed, Angel et al. [84] demonstrated that virosomes interacting with pDC are reliant on sialic acid structures on the cell surface; endocytosis of the virosomes by pDC was inhibited by neuraminidase treatment. However, one also has to consider the targeting of the C-type lectin mannose receptors on DC; Reading et al. [85] demonstrated the importance of the mannose receptor for influenza virus infection of murine macrophages. Nevertheless, sialic acid residues on DC would offer the potential for vaccine targeting, particularly when the vaccine construct carries the haemagglutinin glycoprotein.\n",
            " Another important consideration is the varying phenotype of DC, with respect to DC subsets and particularly DC differentiation and maturation. Sialylated structures on DC are modulated during differentiation or interaction with B cells resulting in an increase in expression of a-2-3-sialylated O-glycans, as well as a-2-6and a-2-3-sialylated N-glycans [86, 87] . Interestingly, such sialylated glycans are important for DC endocytic activity. Maturation of the DC resulted in a reduced expression of the glycans, relating to the reduced endocytic activity of mature DC.\n",
            " An alternative approach to the use of live, non-transmissible, replicating vaccine vectors is the use of virus-like particles (VLP). These lack a viral genome, physically carrying the vaccine antigen of interest within their virion structure. With the foreign (''vaccine'') antigen being within a chimeric structure, replication is no longer necessary. In fact, chimeric vectors can be regarded as ''delivering'' the vaccine in a manner similar to that for an inactivated vaccine. Chimeric viruses based on non-enveloped VLPs can also be defined in terms of structures or sequences interacting with DC receptors. Indeed, it can be seen that the nonenveloped viruses mentioned in Section 3.4 would be candidates for chimeric VLP-based vaccines.\n",
            " There is quite a variety of vectors employed for bearing the antigen of interest (Table 4 ). These range from chimeric peptide constructs to viruses and bacteria [88] [89] [90] [91] . One value of employing non-enveloped virus particles for chimeric constructs is the potential of displaying heterologous antigens, allowing for targeting to the immune system via homologous or heterologous viral ligands for receptors on the DC. Good examples of this approach are the reported applications of porcine parvovirus and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2; Table 4 ), which have been employed for both homologous vaccines [92] and for delivering heterologous epitopes [93] [94] [95] .\n",
            " Biodegradable polymers such as poly(lacticco-glycolic acid) (PLGA) have been applied for protein-based vaccine delivery for over a decade [96] . In addition, polyethyleneimine (PEI) loaded PLGA carriers as well as histidine-rich polymers and lipids have been used for nucleic acid delivery [97] . These polymers offer a main advantage over the vaccine vectors described above in Section 3, as well as those based on other viruses, bacteria or their products. Biodegradable polymers do not induce a strong or durable immune response against themselves. Moreover, they are efficiently degraded into non-toxic metabolites, primarily via the Krebs cycle. Particulate carriers are also flexible in their design, composition and structure, which has led to the demonstration of their high potential as vaccine carriers [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] . The design of these particles has employed a number of components, the main ones being PLGA, PEG-PLGA, PLA, PEG-PLA, hydrophobised cholesterol and polycationic formulations. A list of reviews on this topic is found in Table 5 .\n",
            " Particulate formulations offer a wide applicability for in vivo delivery routes. In addition to their use for parenteral delivery, translocation of nano-and microparticles into systemic immune tissues has been observed after intranasal administration in mice, concomitant with development of immune responses [107] [108] [109] . An important consideration in this respect is the particle size, which appears to be a determinant for the performance of biodegradable particle vaccine delivery [110] . Particulate vaccine delivery has also been successful via the oral route (for example, reviewed by O'Hagan et al. [111] ). Moreover, oral and nasal delivery of chitosan microparticles has been compared with respect to diphtheria vaccine efficacy in mice [109] .\n",
            " Despite these advances and high application value, there is little information on the biological characteristics of DC interaction with and processing of these particle-based vaccines. Moreover, further analyses are required on how such vaccine constructs can activate the ''danger'' recognition by DC necessary for promoting DC maturation and the development of active immunity.

            " Reviews on application of nanoparticle vaccine delivery systems\n",
            " Nanoparticles and microparticles as vaccine-delivery systems [213] Implication of nanoparticles/microparticles in mucosal vaccine delivery [214] The use of soluble polymers and polymer microparticles to provide improved vaccine responses after parenteral and mucosal delivery [215] Vaccine delivery-current trends and future [216] Polylactide-co-glycolide microparticles with surface adsorbed antigens as vaccine delivery systems [217] Nanoparticles as carriers for nasal vaccine delivery [110] Biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microparticles for injectable delivery of vaccine antigens [218] DNA-loaded biodegradable microparticles as vaccine delivery systems and their interaction with dendritic cells [130] Immunological aspects of polymer microsphere vaccine delivery systems [219] Microparticles as vaccine adjuvants and delivery systems [168] Recent developments in vaccine delivery systems [166] Recent advances in vaccine adjuvants [167] Microparticle vaccine approaches to stimulate mucosal immunisation [220] Chitosan and its derivatives in mucosal drug and vaccine delivery [221] Nanoparticles and microparticles for drug and vaccine delivery [96] \n",
            " The recombinant viruses employed for porcine vaccine delivery (Tables 1-3) can be regarded as nanoparticle-based vaccines. Indeed, the adenovirus vectors are effectively nanoparticles delivering a DNA vaccine. In that context, the capacity of the adenovirus to target particular receptors on the DC offers the potential for defined vaccine targeting to the immune system, which can be taken into the field of the biodegradable particlebased vaccine delivery vehicle (see Section 6 below). Similarly, VLP (Table 4 ) are nanoparticles carrying protein vaccine cargoes, albeit forming an integral part of the viral structure. Indeed, the bacteriophages T4 expressing the FMDV P1 protein (together with the T4 expressing FMDV 3C) have been referred to as a nanoparticle surface gene-protein display system [91] .\n",
            " Insofar as the biodegradable vaccine carriers are concerned, there is much less information on their application for porcine vaccines. This is somewhat surprising considering the extent of their application for human vaccines, and vaccines tested in murine models (see the reviews listed in Table 5 ). Nevertheless, there are a number of articles demonstrating the potential of biodegradable carriers for delivery of porcine vaccines (Table 6 ). These also include chitosan-based nanoparticles to entrap plasmids carrying immunomodulatory CpG-ODN motifs [112, 113] . Elaboration of this approach is seen with the application of chitosan-based nanoparticles carrying plasmids encoding porcine IL-2 [90] or IL-6 [112] . For these purposes, the authors employed the net positive charge of chitosan nanoparticles to entrap the DNA in the chitosan polymer matrix by ionic cross-linking.\n",
            " Zhao et al. [112] tested their delivery system in mice, coadministered with a bivalent vaccine against Pasteurella multocida and classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Their results were encouraging in the context of how the nanoparticle-delivered adjuvant enhanced the development of specific immunity and resistance to challenge infection. It will be interesting to see how this application of nanoparticle-delivered adjuvant functions in the porcine host, particularly considering the differences between murine and porcine immune system. As far as delivery of vaccine antigen is concerned, early results using ovalbumin as a model are showing considerable promise both in vitro with porcine DC (Supplementary Fig. 2 ) and in vivo (Harwood et al., unpublished results).\n",
            " Application of nucleic acid vaccines demonstrates the factors to be considered in the context of particle-delivered vaccines. An important influence is the particle charge. Positively charged particles facilitate association with nucleic acid, and also protein antigens with the appropriate negative charge; via ionic crosslinking with the particles. A major consideration -for both anionic and cationic particles -is that sufficient charge be available for binding the cargo. The particle charge is also important concerning mode and efficiency of delivery in vivo. For example, Macklin et al. [114] successfully employed gold particles for epidermal delivery of a DNA vaccine to immunise pigs against H1N1 influenza virus, using a device for particle-mediated gene transfer to the epidermis [115] . Negatively charged nanoparticle constructs also show high potential for delivery through pig skin [116] . Efficient permeation of pig skin was obtained with the negatively charged particles ranging in size from 50 to 500 nm, leading the authors to propose such nanoparticles as potential delivery vectors for transdermal vaccination.\n",
            " Considering that the nucleic acid must be delivered to the target cell in which it will most efficiently transcribe, strong candidate targets are epithelial, fibroblastic or muscle cells; cells with dividing nuclei would increase the chance of DNA entry into the cell nucleus for transcription. The low rate of nuclear division in DC may restrict their capacity to handle DNA vaccines [117] . Nevertheless, targeting DNA vaccines to DC can be successful when applied via viral and bacterial vectors. For example, adenoviruses targeting DC do promote transcription of their DNA (see Section 3.3); the Salmonella typhimurium vector interacts efficiently with murine DC in vitro, and promotes expression of the encoded antigen both in vitro and in vivo [118, 119] .\n",
            " DNA vaccine processing by DC is less promising when the DNA is applied directly to the DC. Ceppi et al. [117] showed that porcine DC directly transfected with DNA do not translocate the DNA into the nucleus nor permit transcription. Franco et al. [120] , showed uptake of a mycobacterial DNA vaccine by human macrophages and DC, but no apparent nuclear translocation or protein production, though mRNA was detectable in monocytes. Transfected cells could induce PBMC proliferation, but this was obtained with PBMC from patients positive or negative for reactivity against mycobacterial antigens.

            " Following direct intradermal inoculation of mice with DNA vaccine encoding influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP), Bot et al. [121] found both MHC Class II + and MHC Class II À cells carrying the NP antigen. However, MHC Class II is insufficient for defining DC or Langerhans cells. Fibrocytes, which are important for activating cytotoxic T-cells, are also MHC Class II positive; it was interesting that adoptive transfer of the NP + MHC Class II + cells did induce cytotoxic T-cells. Although the authors argued against it, the results do not rule out translocation of endocytosed material, especially considering the capacity of DC to endocytose free antigen and also antigen-producing cells for cross-priming. Indeed, Watkins et al. [122] concluded that EGFP synthesised following DNA vaccination of sheep was leaching out of the skin for associating with DC in the afferent lymph. This was based on observations that both plasmid and protein were found in lymph cells and plasma, but only the protein was detected in lymph DC.\n",
            " A number of groups have sought to improve the consequence of DNA vaccine interaction with DC, mostly in murine models. One approach was to encode DC-activating or DC-recruiting cytokines (reviewed by Kutzler and Weiner [123] ). In these cases, the DC are not necessarily the targets for the vaccine, but become involved by enhanced attraction to the site of antigen production, for endocytosis of the antigens or antigen-producing cells. DC can also be directly activated by DNA vaccines, through CpG motifs in the DNA interacting with TLR9, although Spies et al. [124] showed that such activation can be TLR9-independent.\n",
            " Another approach was to increase the targeting of the encoded antigen rather than the DNA. Indeed, You et al. [125] stated that DC showed a limited capacity for uptake of DNA vaccines. Their solution was to encode an antigen with IgG Fc in a fusion protein for vaccination of mice, promoting interaction with the FcR of the DC. Nchinda et al. [126] and Gu et al. [127] employed similar approaches with mice, using DNA encoding a fusion protein with a single chain Fv antibody specific for the DC receptor DEC 205 [126] , or a fusion protein with heat shock protein as the targeting moiety [127] .\n",
            " The above processes do not consider the targeting of the vaccine by delivery vehicles. In the context of DNA vaccines, much work has been performed using gold particle-based delivery, particularly in mice. Although many of these studies mentioned that DC were the key players in promoting immune response development, the majority did not directly quantify vaccine interaction with the DC. This is a major point of criticism raised by Lauterbach et al. [128] . They sought to elaborate on this question by using DNA constructs for either ubiquitous expression (CMV promoter) or specific expression in DC (CD11c promoter). Following biolistic vaccination of mice with DNA-coated gold particles, both forms of construct efficiently induced antibody responses. However, the DNA encoding for DC-specific expression was insufficient at inducing optimum T lymphocyte responses. Porgador et al. [129] also noted that lymph node cells directly expressing DNA-encoded antigen following vaccination of mice were rare. They did find DC carrying the encoded peptide, leading to the proposal that the DC were involved in cross-priming of material produced by transfected myeloblasts.\n",
            " Gold particles for vaccine delivery can be problematic, due to their non-biodegradability and risk of persistence and toxicity. This is not a problem for biodegradable micro/nanoparticle delivery, which has also been promoted for ''targeting'' DNA vaccines to DC. However, many of these articles use the observation that an immune response was generated against the antigens encoded by the DNA as evidence for targeting of the DC (for example, see the review by Jilek et al. [130] ). This is rather speculative, and cannot be considered as proof. On the other hand, the biodegradable particles themselves do interact efficiently with DC (reviewed by Jilek et al. [130] ). Insofar as DNA vaccine delivery is concerned, the most convincing work comes from in vitro studies using cell lines. Jilek et al. [131] successfully transfected a murine DC line with PLGA microparticles carrying DNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). However, the number of cells expressing GFP was low, which the authors related to the requirement for DNA to escape the phagosome wherein the PLGA particles would be degraded. This is a critical point considering the cytosolic localisation of phagosomes contrasting with the cellular localisation of DNA transcription machinery. Indeed, Walter and Merkle [132] showed that particle transfection efficiency is low in phagocytic cells compared with non-phagocytic cells.\n",
            " Biodegradable particles can target DC in vivo, as observed with DC and macrophage endocytosis of PLGA microparticles in the spleen [133] and draining lymph nodes [134] of vaccinated mice. However, these authors did not determine if the encoded antigen was expressed in DC or non-immune cells; the particles were found in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. Moreover, Walter and Merkle [132] proposed that application of biodegradable particle-based DNA delivery in vivo is very likely to lead to transfection of non-phagocytic cells such as fibroblasts.\n",
            " Although much of the work to date has been in mice, DNA vaccination has been reported in pigs. Dincer et al. [135] analysed epidermal delivery of DNA-gold particles in pigs and mini-pigs. Antigen expression was detectable as early as 4 h post-vaccination, but it is uncertain if this reflected interaction of the DNA with nonimmune cells. Nevertheless, one can conclude that particle-based DNA vaccination can be successful in pigs. Application of DNAloaded PLGA microparticles may have a future for porcine vaccination considering the promise shown from studies in mice, guinea pigs, non-human primates and humans (reviewed by Jilek et al. [130] ). While these particles can be targeted to DC, and certain DC may well be capable of allowing DNA transcription, particle-based delivery of DNA vaccines would be improved by targeting non-immune cells. Both Walter and Merkle [132] and Porgador et al. [129] suggested that the cells directly targeted by the particles for DNA transcription may be non-phagocytic cells.\n",
            " One may also consider the reported differences seen with processing of DNA and RNA by DC [117] . This work would suggest that RNA vaccines have a higher potential for biodegradable particle-based delivery to DC. Certainly, DC will accommodate RNA translation and promote processing of the derived protein for induction of specific immunity [70] . It will therefore be interesting to see how the work advances on biodegradable nanoparticles enhancing the uptake of RNA by porcine DC (Supplementary Fig. 3 ).\n",
            " 5. Targeting vaccines to DC: potential for biodegradable particle targeting\n",
            " There have been a number of reports on vaccine carriers targeting DC, but primarily in the murine and human field. Gamvrellis et al. [136] reviewed a number of vaccine constructs which could facilitate uptake by DC. In order to pursue this topic with respect to targeting vaccines to porcine DC, it is necessary to appreciate the advances made in the murine and human fields.\n",
            " Current work is seeking to characterize how DC interact with vaccine carriers, particularly the biodegradable nanoparticle carriers. These have a high potential for application across a number of species and for different vaccines. This is due to their uptake relying on relatively ''simple'' components such as ionic charge, carbohydrate moieties in the particle structure, or particle size, rather than peptide-based (or lipoprotein-or glycoproteinbased) entities as is the case with many viral vectors. Moreover, biodegradable particles lend themselves more readily to modification, in both design and ''decoration'' to carry specific ligands for targeting DC receptors (Fig. 1) .\n",
            " Biodegradable particle structure has been modified and analysed in terms of how this influences DC endocytosis and intracytoplasmic delivery of the vaccine cargos. Not only can they be employed as carriers of protein and nucleic acid-based vaccines (Tables 5 and 6 ), but also as carriers of the adjuvant (Table 6 ). When the two approaches can be combined, an efficient mutual targeting of vaccine and adjuvant may be achievable. When targeting a vaccine to DC, it is necessary to concomitantly deliver a ''danger'' signal to promote activation and maturation of the DC system. Dependent on the ''danger'' signal, it may be desirable to co-deliver this with the vaccine in the same particle, or to use two different particles-one for the vaccine (targeting for example cDC) and one for the adjuvant (targeting for example pDC).\n",
            " When attempting concomitant delivery of vaccine and adjuvant to the DC, it is likely that DNA vaccines would not be the appropriate vaccine choice-protein or RNA vaccines may have greater potential. RNA vaccines also need to target cells, but unlike DNA do not require a dividing nucleus for translation of their encoded genes into protein. DC can certainly accommodate RNA translation, as witnessed when DC are transfected with RNA encoding the complete genomic sequence of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) [137] or FMDV [70] ). Unfortunately, RNA does not efficiently enter DC without assistance [137] . Electroporation or lipofection [70, 117] do allow ''delivery'' of the RNA, but these are not applicable of techniques for in vivo application, except if one relates lipofection to the application of liposomes for vaccine delivery. In this respect, nanoparticles offer a high potential for RNA delivery to DC, as they do for DNA delivery to epithelial or muscle cells.\n",
            " The element which must be considered when applying nanoparticles for targeting protein or RNA vaccines to DC is the influence of targeting on the cellular site of vaccine delivery. Protein is ideally delivered into an acidifying endosomal system, to promote its processing for presentation in association with MHC Class II to Th lymphocytes. For processing in association with MHC Class I, leading to activation of Tc lymphocytes, a different intracellular localisation is required. In the case of RNA, a cytosolic delivery is required, to ensure that the delivered RNA is not degraded by cellular RNases. PLGA particles are reported to escape from endosomes, delivering their payloads into the cytoplasm [138, 139] . Nevertheless, the processes of cellular uptake, retention and processing are not well characterized for particulate vaccine delivery vehicles interacting with DC. This is certainly the case for particles decorated to target and/or activate PRR on the DC. How this would influence delivery to intracellular compartments is of pertinence when choosing the targeting ligand. A good example is the comparison of material delivered through ligation of the DEC205 receptor compared with ligation of the mannose receptor. Targeting DEC205 can lead to antigen recycling through late endosomes, whereas ligation of the mannose receptor may promote more of a recycling process through the peripheral endosomal compartment [15] .\n",
            " A simple approach for DC targeting is the application of antibodies against defined DC receptors. While this has clear potential as a targeting ligand, the overall applicability of such an approach is less certain, whether that be for human or porcine vaccines. Heterologous antibody risks inducing an immune response from the host, while isologous antibody can pose problems when in immune complexes with the vaccine. For the latter, one has to consider removing the Fc portion of the antibody, or preventing its interaction with FcR on cells of the innate immune defences. Nevertheless, antibody interacting with the vaccine carrier would have a role to play, as is the case during the natural humoral responses against an antigen: Immune complex formation would push the equilibrium of the immune response towards memory development.\n",
            " An example of antibody-based DC-targeting is seen with the Siglec (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin superfamily lectin) receptors, primarily expressed on cells of the immune system [140] . Siglecs bind specific glycan structures containing sialic acid [141, 142] . When murine pDC were targeted with ovalbumin conjugated to anti-Siglec-H antibody [143] , an efficient endocytosis of the ovalbumin was observed, leading to stimulation of CD8 + T lymphocytes. The Siglec-5 receptor can also be targeted with specific antibody for enhanced endocytosis. Anti-Siglec-5 (Fab) 2 fragments mediated rapid uptake into early endosomes of human monocytes [144] .\n",
            " One should note that the Siglec family is distributed throughout the immune system, but many are actually inhibitory receptors, carrying immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM). Siglec-10 is one such receptor on human DC [145] , as is Siglec-7 on human DC and monocytes [146] . In contrast, Siglec-H actually lacks tyrosine-based signaling motifs in its cytoplasmic tail, functioning as an efficient endocytic receptor on murine pDC and macrophages, as observed with anti-Siglec-H antibody targeting [143] . Siglec-15 is another receptor of this family which does not carry an ITIM, being expressed on human macrophages and DC [147] . Lysine residues in its transmembrane domain interact with DNAX activation proteins DAP12 and DAP10. Interestingly, Siglec-15 expression appears to be conserved among species [147] .\n",
            " Another important characteristic of the Siglec expression on DC is the modulation associated with maturing cells, a modulation also noted with another glycan-binding DC receptor family, the bgalactoside-binding galectins [148] . Maturation-dependent modulation is also seen with the expression of C-type lectin receptors on DC [149] . In contrast to many of the galectin and Siglec reactions [148] , the expression of C-type lection receptors is downregulated as the DC mature, a phenomenon related to reduced antigen uptake by maturing DC [149] . C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN have also been targeted using specific antibodies, in murine and primate models for vaccine delivery (for example [150, 151] ).\n",
            " In addition to using antibody against DC receptors for vaccine targeting, a number of ligands for particular receptors have been identified, which offer potential for vaccine targeting. Siglec-15 preferentially recognizes Neu5Aca2-6GalNAca [147] . Galectins bind glycoconjugates containing b-galactose structures [148, 152] .\n",
            " However, it is uncertain how vaccine particles interacting with different Siglecs would signal the DC, and how this would influence the outcome of vaccine handling by the cells. Interaction of a vaccine with a Siglec carrying an ITIM would not necessarily be detrimental for vaccine targeting, because it is not yet certain how DC would respond to vaccines using Siglec ligands for targeting purposes. For example, Siglec-10, which carries an ITIM, is reported to bind human red blood cells and soluble sialoglycoconjugates [145] . The Siglec-H, which lacks tyrosine-based signaling motifs, is endocytosed leading to the processing and presentation of captured antigens [153] . Yet, this Siglec signals intracellularly via the DAP12 adaptor with which it is associated, leading to reduced pDC responses against TLR ligands. Siglec-15 also signals via DAP12 and DAP10, but it has been suggested that this signaling implies delivery of activating signals to the cell [147] . Another receptor, Siglec-1 (CD169), is reported to be the receptor for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) binding to and internalisation by porcine macrophages [154] . Considering that virus interaction with this receptor would lead to internalisation, targeting Siglec-1 may prove a useful vaccine targeting strategy. Siglec-1 is also expressed by DC, being upregulated on mature cells, along with Siglec-2 and Siglec-7 as well as two of the galectins-galectin-3 and galectin-8 [148] .\n",
            " There are also a number of ligands defined for C-type lectin receptors -such as DC-SIGN -which would provide useful targeting moieties. Examples of these are the GlcNac(b1-3)-Gal(b1-4)-Glc-R oligosaccharide forming the outer core of Neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide [155] , and Gal(b1-4)(Fuc(a1-3))GlcNAc and Fuc(a1-3)Gal(b1-4)(Fuc(a1-3))GlcNAc determinants relating to the glycosphingolipids of Schistosoma mansoni [156] . With respect to the studies on Neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide interaction with DC-SIGN [155] , mannan and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) were found to interfere with bacterial binding. Mannan, including oxidized and reduced derivatives, enhanced antigen targeting to and endocytosis by DC. This resulted in an activation of the DC and immune response induction in vivo, at least in the mouse [157] . Moreover, the differential application of the oxidized and reduced forms of mannan can favour a more Th1 or Th2 type response, respectively [158] .\n",
            " Certainly, mannan and other mannosylated structures, which can bind to the mannose receptor CD206 as well as DC-SIGN, have been employed for targeting mannose-binding C-type lectins on DC (Table 7) . A number of vaccine antigens also offer this targeting facility, through mannose-containing moieties inherent in their structures. Either these or synthetic structures can be conjugated to the vaccine delivery vehicles, an approach which has found favour with the mannosylation of biodegradable nanoparticle vaccine carriers.\n",
            " Related to the approach with ligands for C-type lectin and Siglec receptors, it is also possible to target other DC receptors, including the TLRs (Fig. 1) important for adjuvant-dependent activation of the cells. Certainly, TLR ligands such as chemically defined lipopeptides have potential as adjuvants [159] . Although lipopeptides have not been reported in terms of vaccine delivery for pigs, lipopeptides and lipoproteins have been tested for their adjuvant potential. These have been employed either as an integral antigenic component of the vaccine [160] [161] [162] , or admixed with the vaccine antigen in a more classical manner [163] . The disadvantage of lipoproteins is that they themselves can be antigenic. In contrast, lipopeptides such as the synthetic compounds based on tri-palmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine (Pam 3 Cys) and di-palmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine (Pam 2 Cys) tend to serve primarily as PAMPs for TLR2 dimers, thus allowing for their application in a more generic sense [164] .\n",
            " Related to this area is the application of lipid-based vaccine carriers, liposomes [165] . Liposomal vaccine delivery and application as an adjuvant have been widely reported for murine and human studies [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] . VLPs can also be constructed to bear lipopeptide surface structures. By inference to the capacity of TLR2 homo-and heterodimers to bind such structures, this allows for potential vaccine targeting and activation of DC [169, 172, 173] .\n",
            " This overview on particulate vaccine targeting to the immune system has presented the current knowledge concerning the relationship between the surface structure of vaccine delivery vehicles and the manner by which DC interact with the particle cargo. Although there is some evidence that vaccine targeting to DC has high potential for porcine vaccines, most of the information comes from inference to work with murine and human DC. Therein, a major effort is being made in the development of both viral and synthetic vaccine carriers. A critically important consideration therein is how receptor ligation influences the characteristics of vaccine interaction with the DC. Whether protein or RNA delivery is being employed, the antigen ultimately present in the DC -delivered by the carrier or translated from the delivered RNA -has to be processed via endosomal recycling and processing. Accordingly, current research on vaccine targeting to DC is seeking to determine the influence of the vaccine delivery vehicle surface decoration on modulation of DC activity. This is linking to the cytosolic localisation of the delivered vaccine cargo, which will be different for a protein cargo compared with an RNA cargo. The key element is to define the manner of targeting to the DC which will promote the appropriate delivery, leading to efficacious immune defence development (Supplementary Fig. 4 ).

            "Body Text:\n",
            " The current pandemic of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights an urgent need to develop a safe, efficacious, and durable vaccine. Using a measles virus (rMeV) vaccine strain as the backbone, we developed a series of recombinant attenuated vaccine candidates expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) and evaluated their efficacy in cotton rat, IFNAR −/− mice, IFNAR −/− -hCD46 mice, and golden Syrian hamsters. We found that rMeV expressing stabilized prefusion S protein (rMeV-preS) was more potent in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies than rMeV expressing full-length S protein (rMeV-S), while the rMeVs expressing different lengths of RBD (rMeV-RBD) were the least potent. Animals immunized with rMeV-preS produced higher levels of neutralizing antibody than found in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients and a strong Th1-biased T cell response. The rMeV-preS also provided complete protection of hamsters from challenge with SARS-CoV-2, preventing replication in lungs and nasal turbinates, body weight loss, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. These data demonstrate that rMeV-preS is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate, supporting its further development as a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 vaccine | measles virus vector | prefusion spike I n December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) was first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China. The causative agent was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic (1) (2) (3) . It spread rapidly within China and swept into at least 200 countries within 3 mo. Symptoms are primarily pneumonia, as with two other important human coronaviruses (CoVs), SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (1-3). As of 1 February 2021, more than 102,399,513 cases had been reported worldwide, with 2,217,005 deaths (∼2.2% mortality). There is an urgent need to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine to protect the populace from this new virus. Globally, more than 300 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are in preclinical development (4) (5) (6) and at least 30 vaccine candidates have entered human clinical trials (4, 5, 7, 8) . Among them, vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA), inactivated virus, and adenovirus vectors (Ad5-nCoV and ChA-dOx1) are now in phase III clinical trials. Excitingly, preliminary results indicate that these vaccines are highly efficacious, reaching 90 to 95% effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection in some cases. The durability of the protection conferred by these vaccine candidates is unknown. Although these vaccine candidates are highly promising, exploration of other vaccine platforms is needed.\n",
            " The CoV spike (S) protein is the main target for neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection and prevent disease. As such, the S protein is the primary focus for CoV vaccine development (9, 10) . The CoV S protein is a class I fusion protein trimer that is incorporated into virions as they bud into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. For SARS-CoV-2, S is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by furin before the virion is Significance Measles virus (MeV) vaccine is one of the safest and most efficient vaccines with a track record in children. Here, we generated a panel of rMeV-based vaccines with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) S antigens inserted near 3′ of the MeV genome. The rMeV expressing a soluble stabilized, prefusion spike (preS) is much more potent in triggering SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody than rMeV-based full-length S vaccine candidate. A single dose of rMeV-preS is sufficient to induce high levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in animals. Furthermore, rMeV-preS induces high levels of Th1-biased immunity. Hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Our results demonstrate rMeV-preS is a safe and highly efficacious bivalent vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 and MeV.\n",
            " released. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that attaches to the hACE2 receptor on the surface of a target cell. The S2 subunit is further cleaved by TMPRSS2 (or cathepsin L/B) and possesses the membrane-fusing activity (9, 11, 12) . Both S and its RBD have been shown to be immunogenic for many CoVs (13) (14) (15) . The native S in the virion is in its \"prefusion\" form. Upon triggering, the prefusion S (preS) undergoes significant conformational changes to insert its fusion peptide into the target cell membrane and bring the virion and cell membranes together, arriving at its postfusion S form as it causes the membranes to fuse. For paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, and HIV, it has been shown that prefusion forms of glycoprotein are more potent in inducing neutralizing antibodies than their postfusion forms (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Currently, whether the SARS-CoV-2 preS protein is more immunogenic than the postfusion S protein is unknown.\n",
            " Live attenuated measles virus (MeV) vaccine has been one of the safest and most efficient human vaccines and has been used in children since the 1960s (21, 22) . Worldwide MeV vaccination campaigns have been very successful in controlling measles. MeV is an enveloped nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Morbillivirus within the Paramyxoviridae family. MeV is an excellent vector to deliver vaccines for human pathogens primarily because of its high safety, efficacy, and longlived immunity (22, 23) . MeV has previously been shown to be a highly efficacious vaccine vector for many viral diseases such as HIV (24, 25) , SARS-CoV-1 (26, 27) , MERS-CoV (28, 29) , respiratory syncytial virus (30) , hepatitis B and C viruses (31) , influenza virus (30, 32) , chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (33) , and flaviviruses (Zika virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus) (34) (35) (36) .\n",
            " Recent human clinical trials have demonstrated that an recombinant MeV (rMeV)-based CHIKV vaccine is safe and highly immunogenic in healthy adults, even in the presence of preexisting anti-MeV vector immunity (33) .\n",
            " In this study, we developed a series of rMeV-based vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and evaluated them in cotton rats, IFNAR −/− mice, IFNAR −/− -hCD46 mice, and golden Syrian hamsters. We found that all SARS-CoV-2 S antigens are highly expressed by the MeV vector. Among these vaccine candidates, rMeV expressing stabilized preS (rMeV-preS) and full-length S (rMeV-S) proteins were the most potent in triggering SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Animals immunized with rMeV-preS induced the highest level of neutralizing antibodies that were higher than convalescent sera of patients recovered from COVID-19, and the highest Th1-biased T cell immune response. Furthermore, hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS provided complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge and lung pathology. The codon optimized full-length S, preS, S-dTM, S1, RBD1, RBD2, and RBD3 were amplified by PCR and inserted into the same position at the gene junction between P and M in the genome of the MeV Edmonston vaccine strain. The domain structure of S protein is shown: SP, signal peptide; RBD, receptor-binding domain; RBM, receptor-binding motif; FP, fusion peptide; HR, heptad repeat; CH, central helix; TM, transmembrane domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail. The organization of negative-sense MeV genome is shown. Le, leader sequence; N, nucleocapsid gene; P, phosphoprotein gene; M, matrix protein gene; F, fusion protein gene; H, hemagglutinin protein gene; L, large polymerase gene; Tr, trailer sequence. (B) The plaque morphology of rMeV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S antigens. All plaques were developed after 5 d of incubation in Vero CCL-81 cells. (C) Multistep growth curve. Confluent Vero CCL81 cells in 12-well plates were infected with each virus at an MOI of 0.01. After 1 h of absorption, fresh DMEM with 2% fetal bovine serum was added. The cell culture supernatants and cell lysates were harvested and combined, and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. Data are geometric mean titers (GMT) ± SD from n = 3 biologically independent experiments. (D and E) Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S and S1 protein expression in cell lysate and supernatants by Western blot. Vero We have developed a yeast-based recombination system for rapidly constructing complementary DNA (cDNA) clones of rMeV expressing foreign genes such as the SARS-CoV-2 S antigens. Six overlapping DNA fragments (designated a to f) spanning the full-length MeV Edmonston vaccine strain and a SARS-CoV-2 gene annealing to the junction between the P and M genes were ligated into the pYES2 vector in a single step mediated by DNA recombinases present in yeast (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). Using this strategy, we constructed a series of rMeV vaccine vectors expressing eight variants of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein: 1) full-length S (S), 2) deletion of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail reflecting the soluble ectodomain (S-dTM), 3) S1 subunit (S1), 4) three different lengths of RBD (RBD1, RBD2, and RBD3) of S, and 5) a prefusion-stabilized soluble ectodomain with deletion of the furin cleavage site, two proline mutations (amino acids 986 and 987), and a self-trimerizing T4 fibritin trimerization motif replacing its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (preS) (9) (Fig. 1A) . All rMeV viruses were recovered from full-length genome cDNAs using the standard reverse genetics system and plaque-purified. To confirm that the recombinant viruses indeed contained the target gene, viral genomic RNA was extracted followed by RT-PCR using primers annealing to the flanking MeV P and M genes. PCR products were sequenced, confirming that S and its variants were inserted into the MeV genome between the P and M genes. Finally, the entire genome of each recombinant virus was sequenced to confirm that no additional mutations had been introduced. Compared to the parental rMeV, all recombinant viruses formed relatively smaller plaques (Fig. 1B) and exhibited delayed syncytia formation and cytopathic effects (CPE) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ). A multistep replication curve showed that these recombinant viruses had delayed replication kinetics in Vero CCL81 cells (Fig. 1C) . However, the peak titer of rMeV-S1 (10 7.2 plaque-forming units [PFU]/mL) was higher than that of the parental rMeV (10 6.9 PFU/mL). Three recombinant viruses (rMeV-RBD1, RBD2, and RBD3) grew to titers comparable to the parental rMeV in Vero CCL-81 cells, whereas rMeV-S and rMeV-preS had 0.3 to 0.5 log reductions in peak titer. These results suggest that insertion of near-full-length SARS-CoV-2 S genes into the MeV genome further attenuates MeV replication.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 S Proteins Are Highly Expressed by the rMeV Vector. We examined the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins by rMeV in confluent Vero CCL81 cells inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Cell culture supernatants and lysates were harvested at 72 and 96 h postinfection and analyzed by Western blot using antibody against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein or MeV N protein. As expected, two proteins with molecular weights of 190 and 95 kDa were detected in rMeV-S-infected cells at 72 h, reflecting the full-length S and cleaved S1 (Fig. 1D ). In rMeV-preS-infected cells, the 180-kDa uncleaved, stabilized preS protein was detected, somewhat smaller because it lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. In rMeV-S1-infected cells, the 95-kDa S1 protein was detected. The preS and S1 but not the full-length S were also secreted into the culture medium. By 96 h postinfection protein expression had increased (Fig. 1D ). Although the S1 subunit from rMeV-S-infected cells had not been detected in the supernatant at 72 h, it was at 96 h ( Fig. 2E ). At both times, much of the S protein had been cleaved to its active form but the release of S1 into the supernatant at the later time suggests that some of the metastable cleaved S protein had either triggered spontaneously or following engagement with its receptor on a neighboring cell. Triggering releases S1 and allows S2 to refold, engaging with the target cell membrane and causing fusion between the two membranes. RBD1 (34 kDa), RBD2 (40 kDa), and RBD3 (45 kDa) proteins were produced by their respective rMeV vector-infected cells (Fig. 2F ), consistent with their predicted molecular weights. High levels of RBD1 and RBD2 were secreted into the cell culture supernatant. These results demonstrated that all of these SARS-CoV-2 S antigens were highly expressed by the rMeV vector, with the exception of S-dTM (Fig. 2E) , which was not pursued further. The extensive fusion CPE observed at both 72 and 96 h (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ) is most likely due to MeV, which causes this type of CPE. Interestingly, the CPE did not impair the production of most versions of the S protein over the 96 h of the experiment.\n",
            " rMeV-Expressed S and preS Are Highly Immunogenic in Cotton Rats.\n",
            " Cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) are a susceptible model for MeV infection (37) . Thus, we first tested the immunogenicity of these rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates in cotton rats ( Fig. 2A) . Four-week-old specific-pathogen-free cotton rats were immunized subcutaneously with 4 × 10 5 PFU of each rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate and boosted with 2 × 10 6 PFU of the same vaccine candidate 4 wk later. Sera were collected at weeks 4, 6, and 8, and S-specific antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using preS protein as the antigen. By week 4, all five cotton rats in the rMeV-preS group had developed S-specific antibodies, whereas only three out of five cotton rats in the rMeV-S group had (Fig. 2B ). However, antibodies were detectable at the lowest dilution in most cotton rats in the rMeV-S1 and RBD1-3 groups. After the booster immunization, antibodies in the rMeV-preS group were uniformly high, whereas three cotton rats in rMeV-S had high antibody titers and two had low antibody titers. Despite the booster immunization, antibody titers in the rMeV-S1 group remained low and antibody titers in rMeV-RBD1-3 were at the minimum detectable level (Fig. 2B) .\n",
            " The functional activities of the antibodies in sera from the two groups with the most antibody to S, rMeV-S and rMeV-preS, were tested for their ability to neutralize live SARS-CoV-2, in comparison to the rMeV group. Neutralizing antibody titers in the rMeV-preS group were significantly higher than those in the rMeV-S group (P < 0.05), on average 5.5-fold higher (Fig. 2C) . Therefore, in the MeV expression system, preS is the most effective immunogen for inducing neutralizing antibodies in the cotton rat.\n",
            " rMeV-preS Is Highly Immunogenic in IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 Mice and Induces High Levels of Th1-Biased T Cell Immune Responses. MeV vaccine strains can use several receptors (human CD46, CD150, and Nectin 4) to infect different cell types (22) . Type-I interferon receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) knockout, human CD46 transgenic mice (IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46) mice can be robustly infected by MeV and have been used as a model to test the efficacy of many rMeV-based vaccine candidates (38) . Thus, rMeV-preS and rMeV-S1 were tested in IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice to determine if they are immunogenic (Fig. 3A) . Six-week-old IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice were immunized with 8 × 10 5 PFU of each vaccine candidate (half subcutaneous and half intranasal) and at week 2 were boosted with the same vaccine candidate at a dose of 6 × 10 5 PFU. Sera were collected at week 3 and antibody to preS was quantified by ELISA. We observed that rMeV-S1 induced higher antibody in IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice than in cotton rats. However, rMeV-preS induced more antibody than rMeV-S1, but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05) (Fig. 3B) . These results suggest that rMeV-S1 may replicate more robustly in the presence of hCD46 receptor than it did in the cotton rat, where it induced a lower level of antibody.\n",
            " At week 3, all groups were euthanized and their splenocytes were used to characterize vaccine-induced T cell immunity. We first quantified SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-producing T cells by enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot). Mice immunized with rMeV-preS had significantly higher frequencies of S1 peptide-specific IFN-γ-producing T cells compared to the control mice vaccinated with rMeV vector (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3C ). Upon stimulation with peptide pools spanning the S1 subunit, five out of six mice in the rMeV-preS group showed a strong antigen-specific IFN-γ-producing T cell response, whereas only two out of six mice in the rMeV-S1 group showed a weak T cell response (Fig. 3C ). When S2 peptide pools were used for stimulation, only two of six mice in the rMeV-preS group had a strong IFN-γ-producing T cell response (Fig. 3C) , indicating that the vaccine candidate induced T cells primarily targeting the N terminus of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To further characterize the nature of vaccine-induced T cells, four mice with the strongest IFN-γ-producing T cell responses in the rMeV-preS group were analyzed using flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 3 D and E) . Th1 cells, which produce cytokines such as IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin (IL)-2, play an important role in protection against viral infection (39) . After peptide stimulation ex vivo, CD8 + T cells producing one or more of the three signature Th1 cytokines, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, were detected in all four mice immunized with rMeV-preS (Fig. 3 D and E) . Moreover, antigen-specific cytokine-producing CD4 + T cells were also detected but at lower frequencies representing 0.1 to 0.5% of the total CD4 + T cells (Fig. 3D ). Together, these data suggest that rMeV-preS vaccine candidate is capable of inducing robust T cell immunity that is predominated by CD8 + T cells capable of producing Th1 cytokines.\n",
            " A Single Immunization of rMeV-preS Induces a High Level of Antibody in IFNAR1 −/− Mice. Recently, it was shown that type-I interferon, but not the hCD46, is the barrier for MeV infection in mice (38) . IFNAR1 −/− mice can be readily infected by MeV (38) . Thus, we compared the effectiveness of single immunization and booster immunization in inducing S-specific antibody in IFNAR1 −/− mice. For the single immunization group, IFNAR1 −/− mice were immunized with 8 × 10 5 PFU of rMeV-preS (half subcutaneous and half intranasal). For the booster immunization group, IFNAR1 −/− mice were immunized with 8 × 10 5 PFU of rMeV-preS and were boosted at the same dose 4 wk later (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A ). At week 7, S-specific antibody in the booster immunization group was significantly higher than the single immunization group (P < 0.01) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B ). At week 8, there was no significant difference between these two groups (P > 0.05) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B ). This result suggests that a single (C) Measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody. Antibody titer was determined by a plaque reduction neutralization assay.

            " rMeV-preS Is Highly Immunogenic in Golden Syrian Hamsters. Golden Syrian hamsters are an excellent animal model to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the efficacy of vaccine candidates or antiviral drugs. Early studies also suggest that golden Syrian hamsters are susceptible to MeV infection (40, 41) . However, the optimal route for MeV immunization in hamsters is unknown. Thus, we chose the combination of intranasal and subcutaneous route for immunization in order to achieve maximal levels of immune responses. We chose rMeV-S1 to compare with rMeV-preS in the hamster study as rMeV-S1 induced good antibody responses in IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice (Fig. 3B) and grew to the highest titer in Vero cells (Fig. 1C ). Ten 4-wk-old golden Syrian hamsters in each group were first immunized with 8 × 10 5 PFU of the parental rMeV, rMeV-preS, or rMeV-S1 and boosted with the same dose 3 wk later (Fig. 4A) . High antibody titers were detected in all 10 hamsters in the rMeV-preS group at week 2 after a single-dose vaccination. After a booster immunization at week 3, antibody titers further increased at weeks 4 and 6 (Fig. 4B) . However, only 1 out of 10 hamsters in the rMeV-S1 group produced a robust antibody response (Fig. 4B) . As expected, neutralizing antibodies in the rMeV-preS group were detectable at week 2 and increased at weeks 4 and 6, whereas neutralizing antibodies in the rMeV-S1 group remained at minimally detectable levels (Fig. 4C) .\n",
            " We compared the level of neutralizing antibody induced by rMeV-preS in hamsters with that induced in acute and convalescent IFNAR −/− -hCD46 mice (n = 5 or 6) were inoculated with 8 × 10 5 PFU of rMeV, rMeV-preS, or rMeV-S1. Two weeks later, mice were boosted with 6 × 10 5 PFU of each virus. Half the dose was delivered subcutaneously and the other half was delivered intranasally. Serum samples were collected at week 3 for antibody detection. Mice were killed at week 3 for the T cell assays. (B) Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibody by ELISA. Highly purified preS protein was used as the coating antigen for ELISA. Dotted line indicates the detectable level at the lowest dilution. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (****P < 0.0001; ns indicates no significant difference; P > 0.05). (C) ELISpot quantification of IFN-γ-producing T cells. Spot forming cells (SFC) were quantified after the cells were stimulated by peptides representing N (S1 peptides, red) and C (S2 peptides, green) termini of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

As expected, antibody titer of convalescent sera from the recovered COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than the titer of sera collected from the same patients during acute infection (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4C) . Importantly, neutralizing antibody titers at weeks 4 and 6 in rMeV-preS-immunized hamsters were significantly higher than these random human convalescent sera (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) (Fig. 4C) . These results confirm that rMeV-preS is highly immunogenic.\n",
            " Replication in Golden Syrian Hamsters. At week 7, hamsters in the rMeV, rMeV-S1, and rMeV-preS groups were moved to a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) animal facility and challenged intranasally with 10 5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. The normal control hamsters continued to be housed in the BSL2 animal facility and were inoculated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). At day 4 postchallenge, five animals from each group were killed, and the remaining five animals were killed at day 12 postchallenge. We systemically evaluated the protection efficacy of rMeV-based vaccine candidates including clinical signs, weight loss, viral replication, RNA replication, cytokine responses in the lung, and lung histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Hamsters in the rMeV vector control group that were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited clinical symptoms such as ruffled coat and weight loss (Fig. 5A) . Hamsters in the rMeV group started to lose weight at day 1 postchallenge and reached ∼15% weight loss at day 6 and then started to regain weight from days 8 to 12 (Fig. 5A) . Hamsters in the rMeV-S1 groups had similar weight loss from days 1 to 6 but had a faster weight recovery compared to the rMeV group (Fig. 5A) . Importantly, hamsters in the rMeV-preS group did not have any abnormal reaction or weight loss. The body weight in the rMeV-preS group was not significantly different at most time points compared to the normal controls (Fig. 5A) .\n",
            " At day 4, five animals from each group were killed, and lungs, nasal turbinate, brain, liver, and spleen were collected for virus titration by plaque assay. An average titer of 7.4 × 10 5 and 1.7 × 10 5 PFU/g of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in lungs (Fig. 5B ) and nasal turbinates (Fig. 5C ) in the rMeV group, respectively. No infectious virus was detected in brain, liver, or spleen tissues in the rMeV group. Similarly, 4.4 × 10 5 and 1.7 × 10 5 PFU/g of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in lungs (Fig. 5B) and nasal turbinates (Fig. 5C ) in the rMeV-S1 group, respectively, which were not significantly different from the rMeV group (P > 0.05). Importantly, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was below the detection limit in the lung in the rMeV-preS group (Fig. 5B ) and only three out five animals had low viral titer (1.9 × 10 3 PFU/g) in nasal tissue (Fig. 5C ). At day 12, the remaining five hamsters in each group were killed. No infectious SARS-CoV-2 was detected in lung ( Fig. 5B ), nasal turbinate (Fig. 5C) , or other tissues of any group.\n",
            " To determine if SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA was present in these tissues we used primers annealing to the 5′ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The highest number of background RNA copies detected in an unchallenged control group was set as the detection limit. As expected, high genome RNA copies were detected in both the lung (Fig. 5D ) and nasal turbinate (Fig. 5E ), moderate levels of viral RNA were detected in brain (Fig. 5F) , and near-detectable levels of viral genome RNA were detected in liver (Fig. 5G) and spleen (Fig. 5H ) tissues in the rMeV group at day 4. It should be noted that genomic RNA copies in lung, nasal turbinate, and brain in the rMeV-preS group were significantly lower than in the rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups (P < 0.001, P < 0.0001). Importantly, the average RNA copies in lungs, brain, liver, and spleen from the rMeV-preS group were near or below the detection limit whereas nasal turbinate had RNA titers of ∼10 4 RNA copies/g tissue. At day 12, low levels of RNA were detected in nasal tissue and little or no RNA was detectable in all other tissues in all groups.\n",
            " In addition to the full-length genome RNA, SARS-CoV-2 replication generates subgenomic RNA, which is more abundant than genomic RNA. Thus, we determined the levels of total viral RNA including genomic and subgenomic RNA using primers annealing to the N gene located at the 3′ end of the genome. Overall, the patterns of total RNA titers in lung (Fig. 5I) , nasal turbinate (Fig. 5J ), brain (Fig. 5K) , liver (Fig. 5L) , and spleen (Fig. 5M) were similar to those of genomic RNA in these tissue Collectively, these results demonstrate that rMeV-preS vaccination provided complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters whereas rMeV-S1 was unable to protect hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",
            " Storm in Lungs. Cytokine storms play an important role in the pathogenesis and disease severity of COVID-19 patients (42) . Thus, we determined whether rMeV-preS vaccination can prevent cytokine storm in the lungs. Briefly, IFN-α1, IFN-γ, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, TNF, and CXCL10 in lungs in each group were quantified by real-time RT-PCR and normalized to a control. Lung IFN-γ (Fig. 6B) , IL-6 ( Fig. 6E) , and CXCL10 (Fig. 6G ) mRNA had ∼17to 36-, 66-to 84-, and 27-to 48-fold increases in rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups compared to the normal control group, respectively. However, the increases in these three cytokine mRNAs in the rMeV-preS group were minimal (two-to fourfold increase). Statistically, IFN-γ, IL-6, and CXCL10 were indistinguishable between the rMeV-preS group and the normal control group (P > 0.05). In addition, increases in TNF (Fig. 6F ) and IL-1b (Fig. 6C) in the rMeV-preS group were significantly less than in rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups (P < 0.05). IFN-α1 (Fig. 6A ) and IL-2 (Fig. 6D) in rMeV, rMeV-S, and rMeV-preS groups were similar (P > 0.05). These results suggest that rMeV-preS immunization prevents the cytokine storm in hamster lungs caused by a SARS-CoV-2 challenge.\n",
            " Lung Pathology. All lungs from the hamster challenge study were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and the severity of histological changes was scored blindly by a trained veterinary pathologist (Fig. 7) . At day 4 postchallenge, all lung tissues from the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated rMeV group had extremely severe lung histopathological changes (average score of 4.0) characterized by extensive inflammation, interstitial pneumonia, edema, alveolitis, bronchiolitis, alveolar destruction, mononuclear cell infiltration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and peribronchiolar inflammation (Figs. 7 and 8 ). Lung pathology in the rMeV-S1 group was also very severe (average score of 3.8) but slightly less than in the rMeV group (P > 0.05) (Figs. 7 and 8 ). In contrast, lung tissues from the rMeV-preS group had little to mild pathological changes (average score of 0.8) (Figs. 7 and 8) . No lung pathology was found in the normal control group (score of 0) (Figs. 7 and 8) . At day 12, lung pathology in the rMeV group was still extremely severe (average score of 3.8) (Fig. 7 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ). Severe lung pathology (average score of 3.4) was found in the rMeV-S1 group. However, mild lung pathology (score of 0.9) was detected in the rMeV-preS group (Fig. 7 and SI Appendix, Fig.  S5 ). Lung sections were also stained with SARS-CoV-2 N antibody by IHC. At day 4, large amounts of SARS-CoV-2 N antigen were detected in all lung sections from the rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups (Fig. 9 ). In contrast, no N antigen was detected in lungs of the rMeV-preS group or the normal control ( Fig. 9 ). At day 12, little N antigen was detected in the rMeV and rMeV-S1 groups and no antigen was detected in the lungs of the rMeV-preS group or normal control (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 ). These results demonstrate that rMeV-preS vaccination protects hamsters from lung pathology and prevents SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression in lungs.\n",
            " In this study we developed a highly efficacious rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We found that the rMeV-preS-based vaccine candidate is more potent in triggering SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody than the rMeV-based full-length S vaccine candidate. Antibodies induced by rMeV-preS were uniformly high in all four animal models including cotton rats, IFNAR −/− mice, IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice, and Syrian golden hamsters and were significantly higher than antibody titers of human sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients. A single immunization of rMeV-preS was sufficient to induce a high level of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody. In addition, rMeV-preS induces high levels of Th1-biased T cell immunity. Syrian golden hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge including body weight loss, viral replication, cytokine storm, and lung pathology.\n",
            " The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine is one of the most successful vaccines in human history (21, 22) . Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, one dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective against MeV, 78% effective against mumps virus (MuV), and 97% effective against rubella. Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective against MeV and 88% effective against MuV. Both MeV and MuV are nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus and have potential as vectors to deliver foreign antigens. Particularly, MeV has been widely used as a vaccine vector. To date, more than 100 antigens have been expressed by MeV and more than 20 rMeV-based vaccines have been tested in preclinical trials (23, 43) . Animal studies have shown that rMeV-based vaccines are highly effective against infectious diseases. Common immunization routes such as intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intranasal were effective to induce a high level of immune responses in cotton rats, IFNAR1 −/− -hCD46 mice, and nonhuman primates (34, 44, 45) . Currently, phase I clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate MeV-vectored vaccines against Zika virus (NCT02996890 and NCT04033068), Lassa virus (NCT04055454), and HIV (NCT01320176). In addition, a phase II clinical trials have demonstrated that a rMeV-vectored CHIKV vaccine was highly effective against CHIKV infection in humans (33) .\n",
            " Our data demonstrate that MeV is an excellent vaccine platform for delivering a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Live attenuated MeV vaccine has been widely used and has an excellent track 7 . Lung pathology score after challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Fixed lung tissues from days 4 and 12 after SARS-CoV-2 challenge were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm, deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin for the examination of histological changes by light microscopy. Each slide was quantified based on the severity of histologic changes including inflammation, interstitial pneumonia, edema, alveolitis, bronchiolitis, alveolar destruction, mononuclear cell infiltration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and peribronchiolar inflammation. Score 4 = extremely severe lung pathological changes; score 3 = severe lung pathological changes; score 2 = moderate lung pathological changes; score 1 = mild lung pathological changes; score 0 = no pathological changes. Data were analyzed using twoway ANOVA (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001). record of high safety and efficacy in the human population since the 1960s (33, 46, 47) . MeV grows to high titers in Vero cells, a WHO-approved cell line for vaccine production, facilitating vaccine manufacturing. Natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may not be long-lived (48, 49) . However, MeV vaccine induces longlasting immunity and protection against MeV infections (22, 50) . By expressing the S protein from an rMeV vector, it may be possible to also induce long-lasting immunity to the S protein and to protect against COVID-19 disease. In areas of the world where MeV vaccination is not complete, such a combination vaccine could protect against both diseases. By incorporating rMeV-preS into the existing MMR vaccine, a quadruple vaccine could be developed against these four important pathogens for children. According to American Academy of Pediatrics, the number of US infants, children, and teens diagnosed with COVID-19 had reached more 2.6 million by 21 January 2021, accounting for 12.7% of all cases in the United States. Such a quadruple vaccine would be highly attractive for children.\n",
            " In this study, we directly compared the efficacy of preS, native full-length S, S1, and three different lengths of RBD antigens in cotton rats. We found that the preS protein is the most potent antigen in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA antibodies, but more importantly, neutralizing antibodies. All five cotton rats immunized with rMeV-preS triggered uniformly high antibody responses whereas antibody titers in the rMeV-S group were variable. Although there was no significant difference in antibody titers (P > 0.05), the rMeV-preS induced significantly higher neutralizing antibodies than rMeV-S (P < 0.05). Similarly, rMeV-preS induced uniformly high antibodies in other animal models including IFNAR −/− -CD46 mice and golden Syrian hamsters. In hamsters, the neutralizing antibody induced by rMeV-preS was significantly higher than human COVID-19 convalescent sera (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that preS is more immunogenic than native full-length S. It is likely that spontaneous triggering of the metastable native full-length S leads to release of the S1 portion of the protein and refolding to the postfusion form, thereby losing the prefusion-specific antigenic sites and reducing its ability to induce neutralizing antibodies. This is similar to many fusion glycoproteins (such as those from paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, and HIV) in that the \"prefusion\" form of proteins are more potent in inducing neutralizing activity than its \"postfusion\" forms (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . We also found that S1 and the RBDs are poor antigens in the MeV vector, which is probably due to the suboptimal conformation of these monomeric proteins. Interestingly, Pfizer's BNT162b1, a lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the trimerized RBD, was effective in triggering neutralizing antibody in human clinical trials (7, 51) . Perhaps, the trimerization and/or adjuvants enhance its immunogenicity.\n",
            " One important advantage of using rMeV-preS-based vaccine candidate is that rMeV-preS induced predominately a Th1biased T cell response, thereby reducing the risk of potential antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). We observed high frequencies of CD8 + T cells capable of producing Th1 cytokines, whereas frequencies of CD4 + T cells were low. Similar results were observed in an earlier study in which mice were vaccinated with recombinant adenovirus vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein (52) . Consistent with this, hamsters immunized with rMeV-preS were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge without any enhanced lung immunopathology. These results suggest that rMeV-preS is safe and highly efficacious. Historically, ADE has been a challenge in coronavirus vaccine development (53) . It was reported that inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine candidates (54) and several SARS-CoV-1 vaccine candidates, including an inactivated whole-virus vaccine (55), virus-like-particle vaccine (56) , and modified vaccinia virus Ankara-based recombinant vaccine (57), induced ADE in various animal models. Mechanistically, the excessive Th2-cytokine-biased responses and inadequate Th1-biased T cell response contributed to the immunopathology upon SARS-CoV-1 infection (53, 55, 56) . Thus, an ideal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should induce a high level of Th1 but not Th2-biased T cell response. Clearly, the rMeV-preS-based vaccine platform meets this criterion.\n",
            " During preparation of this manuscript, Hörner et al. reported an rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (58) . They inserted the full-length S gene between the H and L genes, the last two genes of the MeV genome and therefore the S protein would be expressed at a lower level. A single immunization of this recombinant virus [MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H)] did not induce any SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody. After booster immunization, only three out of seven animals produced detectable neutralizing antibody. After challenge with SARS-CoV-2, the MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H)-immunized hamsters had significant weight loss at postinfection days (PIDs) 1 to 3 but started to gain weight at PID 4. Furthermore, 4 to 5 log PFU/g tissue of SARS-CoV-2 were still detected in the nasal turbinate in MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H)-immunized hamsters. Thus, MeV vac2 -SARS2-S(H) only induced partial protection Fig. 9 . rMeV-preS immunization prevents SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression in lungs. IHC staining of lung sections from hamsters killed at day 4 after SARS-CoV-2 challenge is shown. Lung sections were stained with SARS-CoV-2 N antibody. Micrographs with 1×, 2×, 4×, and 10× magnification of a representative lung section from each group are shown. Scale bars are indicated at the left corner of each image. against SARS-CoV-2 challenge (58) . It should be noted that our study differs significantly from the Hörner's study. We significantly improved the efficacy of the rMeV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by using two different strategies. First, we generated rMeV expressing a stabilized, preS (rMeV-preS) and rMeV expressing full-length S protein (rMeV-S) and found that rMeV-preS was significantly more potent in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies than rMeV-preS. Second, our preS and S genes were inserted at the P and M gene junction, near the 3' end of the MeV genome. As a typical nonsegmented negativesense RNA virus, MeV mRNA transcription is sequential and gradient such that 3′ proximal genes are transcribed more abundantly than 5′ distal genes, thereby producing more copies of their encoded proteins. Thus, the expression of preS and S in our vaccines is much higher than Hörner's vaccine, which further enhance the immunogenicity. As shown in our report, rMeV-preS induced uniformly high levels of neutralizing antibody in all animals in all four animal models. A single immunization of rMeV-preS is sufficient to induce a high level antibody response. Importantly, rMeV-preS induced higher levels of neutralizing antibody than found in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, rMeV-preS provides complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.\n",
            " In summary, we have developed a safe and highly efficacious rMeV-based preS vaccine candidate that can provide complete protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and lung pathology in animal models, supporting its further development as a vaccine.\n",

            " Many efforts have been made to generate spike glycoprotein-based vaccines to induce immunoprotection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both the mRNA-based (Jackson, Anderson et al., 2020 , Mulligan, Lyke et al., 2020 and protein-based (Guebre-Xabier, Patel et al., 2020) vaccines are effective in humans. Further protein-based designs at a preclinical stage of development promise superior safety and efficacy, at least in animal models (Watterson, Wijesundara et al., 2021) . However, there has been and continues to be a growing concern that existing and emerging virus mutants may escape currently-available vaccine-induced immunity (Mostaghimi, Valdez et al., 2021) . Although vaccinated individuals infected with the delta or omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 have a lower infectious viral titer (IVT) than non-vaccinated individuals (Puhach, Adea et al., 2022) , the spread of these variants is very rapid, despite high rates of vaccination using mRNA or vector vaccines encoding the spike protein alone. Therefore, proposals have been made to include other SARS-CoV-2 proteins known to generate high antibody titers and T-cell responses (Ahlen, Frelin et al., 2020 , Dutta, Mazumdar et al., 2020 .\n",
            " One of the four structural proteins ubiquitously required for viral replication is the nucleocapsid, which is immediately translated and expressed at excess quantities so that it is even secreted from infected cells into the blood. As a result, nucleocapsid detection is an effective means to screen infected individuals even before the onset of symptoms (Diao, Wen et al., 2020 , particularly because antibody production against this protein is rapid and abundant (Burbelo, Riedo et al., 2020 , Guo, Ren et al., 2020 . The 100-300 aa region of the nucleocapsid induces the highest antibody titer in humans (Smits, Hernández-Carralero et al., 2021) , which is attributed to its octapeptide structure homologous to the four hyperendemic seasonal coronaviruses (Pajenda, Kapps et al., 2021) . Epitope profiling of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with cross-reactivity to seasonal coronaviruses (Ladner, Henson et al., 2021) together with experimental data showing that an antibody against the nucleocapsid can protect mice from lethal infection with a hepatitis virus (Nakanaga, Yamanouchi et al., 1986) highlight the conceptual and technical potential of targeting this protein epitope. In addition, recent work in hamsters showed that immunization with attenuated intracellular replicating bacterium-vectored vaccines protects from the typical disease pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Jia, Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al., 2021) .\n",
            " Alternatively, specific antibodies raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize and inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-expressing cells . As such, the RBD is an immunodominant and specific target of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production in virus-infected individuals (Premkumar, Segovia-Chumbez et al., 2020) .\n",
            " Here, we generated a fusion protein that combines the nucleocapsid (N100-300 aa) and the RBD of the spike protein (S300-685 aa) in one molecule. The recombinant construct was introduced into bacterial and insect expression vectors and produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and insect cells, respectively.\n",
            " Its immunogenic efficacy was shown by murine vaccination studies using a prime-booster strategy, tested against all strains of SARS-CoV-2, provided prolonged immune responses and lacked any appreciable side-effect, particularly those occurring in the brain and related to mortality in humans exposed to other vaccines (Greinacher, Thiele et al., 2021 , Rzymski, Perek et al., 2021 , Zuhorn, Graf et al., 2021 .\n",
            " A total of 18 male and 4 female mice (C57BL/6J, 8-12-week-old) were group housed under standard conditions with a 12/12 light/dark cycle. The Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research granted approval for this research (2021-0.721.018). Experimental procedures were conformed to the 2010/63 European Communities Council Directive. Mice were habituated for at least a week to their environments and their numbers were kept at an absolute minimum. Blood was collected from the facial vein at a maximum volume of 200 µl every other week. At the end of the postimmunization survival period, mice were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane (at 5% with 1 L/min flow rate of tubed air) and then perfusion-fixed by transcardially applying 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.0). Dissected brains were immersed in the same fixative (without glutaraldehyde) at 4 °C overnight. Brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PB at 4 °C for 3 days. Coronal sections (50 μm) were cut on a cryostat microtome (1-in-4 series) and kept in 0.05% NaN3 in PB until immunohistochemical processing.\n",
            " The fusion protein was constructed using the Gibson assembly method (Gibson, Young et al., 2009) .\n",
            " For vector construction, the portion of the nucleocapsid (N100-300 aa) fused to the RBD (S300-685 aa) including 4 glycines as a hinge region was cloned into a pET-30a vector and designated 'VieVac' (Supplementary Figure 1A) .

To demonstrate the adsorption of the immunogen to the adjuvant, the nanostructured vaccine was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 4 min. The precleared supernatant and pellet each were treated with Laemmli sample buffer and loaded separately onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and run under reducing conditions. The gel was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrans by semi-dry blotting. The filter was then incubated with convalescent sera diluted 1:100 and further developed as described above.\n",
            " The purified VieVac protein was mixed with Imject™ alum and mice (n = 4) were injected intraperitoneally with 20 µg of the prepared immunogen after 5 h of dialysis against PBS. In a second step, the adjuvant AddaVax™ combined with the VieVac protein was dialyzed similarly, then animals were injected with the adjuvant only for the control group (n = 5) and with the immunogenic AddaVax/VieVac protein at doses of 10µg, 20µg and 40µg (n = 13). In both experiments, a second immunization with the same antigen preparation was administered after 14 days (Figure 2A) . Serum was collected 14 and 28 days after the first immunization and tested by ELISA. Gene expression in blood cells and spleen was measured by qPCR at day 28.\n",
            " Ninety-six-well or 384 well (IgG titer analysis) flat-bottom non-tissue culture treated plates (Falcon) were coated with 100 µl/well of recombinant protein (both N and S) at a concentration of 1µg/ml. After 1 h of incubation at room-temperature on a plate shaker set to 300 rpm, the antigen-containing fluid was replaced by protein-containing blocking buffer (2x blocking reagent in PBS) for an incubation period of 30 min. Following a brief wash with PBS (200 µl), mouse serum diluted 10 -2 to 10 -5 in 100 µl assay buffer was incubated on a plate shaker for 60 min. The ELISA plate was then washed 3x with 350 µl TPBS using an ELISA washing machine (ELX50 Auto Strip Washer, Bio-Tek, Inc.). Antibody binding was determined with goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugate (1:10,000 in assay buffer supplemented with goat serum (2% V/V)) and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Finally, 100 µl of TMB substrate/chromogen mixture were applied and reacted in the dark for 10 min. Color development was terminated by adding 100 µl of 2M H2SO4 and read on an ELISA reader (Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader, Bio-Tek, Inc.) at 450 nm. Each sample was processed in technical duplicates. S and N titers were measured by end-titration using flat-bottomed 384-well Nunc™ plates. ELISA was performed under similar conditions as above, with the reaction volume reduced to 50 µl per well. The reciprocal of the serum dilution was chosen, which gave a 2-fold OD value over the control.\n",
            " Peripheral blood was subjected to hemolysis using the Erythrocyte Lysis Buffer EL (Qiagen) and RNA was isolated from white blood cells by the MagMAX mirVana Total RNA isolation kit. In brief, lysis buffer mixed with isopropanol was added to each cell pellet and incubated for 3 min. RNA-binding bead mix was added to adsorb RNA onto magnetic beads. Following aspiration of the supernatant, magnetic beads were washed sequentially. TURBO DNase solution was used to prevent genomic DNA contamination, followed by addition of rebinding buffer mixed with isopropanol. Magnetic beads were washed again and after removing the supernatant dried on a rotating platform. Finally, RNA was released by preheated elution buffer and evaluated for its concentration. Tissue fragments of 20-50 mg of mouse spleen were minced in Precellys Ceramic Kit 2.8 mm tubes using the precellys 24 lysis and homogenization device (Bertin Technologies) following the addition of 1000 µl of TRIzol™ Reagent.\n",
            " Subsequently, 200 µl of chloroform were applied and mixed by frequently inverting each tube.\n",
            " Following centrifugation at 12,000 g for at 4 °C for 10 min, the aqueous phase was mixed with 500 µl isopropanol. After incubation fat room temperature or 10 min, RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min. RNA pellets were dried after a wash with 75% ethanol and dissolved in nuclease free water for quantification by a Nano drop device.\n",
            " Six hundred ng of RNA were mixed with random primers heated at 65 °C and briefly chilled on ice.\n",
            " dNTPs, RevertAid RT and reaction buffer were added and subjected to first strand synthesis at 55°C for 60 min following primer annealing at 25 °C for 5 min. Enzyme activity was inactivated by heating at 80 °C for 10 min. A 20 µl first strand solution was diluted with 60 µl nuclease-free water and either processed immediately or stored at -80°C. For quantitative PCR, 2 µl of first strand DNA, 1 µl of 10x gene specific ProbeSet from TaqMan, 5 µl of TaqMan 2x universal PCR master mix and 2 µl H2O were mixed for each reaction, which all were carried out in duplicate. Reactions were performed on 384 well plates in a QuantStudio 6 Flex machine (Applied Biosystems). At each experiment, 40 cycles were recorded and quantitative data were presented in ΔΔCT mode and showing fold regulation relative to the control. Statistics were calculated using ΔCT values of individual samples.\n",
            " Viable mouse splenocytes were isolated by homogenizing spleen tissues through a 70 µm mesh followed by erythrocyte lysis using the RBC Lysis Buffer (Biolegend) \n",
            " Free-floating sections were rinsed in PB (0.1M, pH 7.4). Non-specific immunoreactivity was suppressed by incubating the sections in a mixture of 5% normal donkey serum (NDS; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PB at room temperature for 2 h. Sections were then exposed (4°C for 3 days) to select combinations of primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 2 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss) at either 10× or 63× primary magnification with the pinhole set to 0.5 -0.7 μm. Emission spectra for each dye were limited as follows: Cy2 (505-530 nm), Cy3\n",
            " (560-610 nm) and Cy5 (650-720 nm). Cell counting was performed in ImageJ. Three sections of the hippocampus (CA1) were analyzed per animal (n = 3/experimental group). The stratum pyramidale was excluded from quantification because of its high neuron density.\n",
            " Adherence to a Gaussian distribution was determined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normallydistributed data were provided as means ± s.d. In case of skewed distribution, data were described as medians (25 th and 75 th percentiles). Qualitative variables were described with counts and percentages and compared using Fisher's exact test. A two-tailed p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed with SPSS ® Statistics (version 21). In histochemical experiments, data were normalized to a surface area of 1 mm 2 and expressed as means ± s.e.m, followed by one-way ANOVA in GraphPad Prism.\n",
            " Earlier work in infected individuals showed abundant antibody production against parts of the nucleocapsid, while neutralizing antibodies were shown to recognize regions in the RBD (and also NTD) of the spike protein (Sterlin, Mathian et al., 2021 . These findings prompted us to design a fusion protein including immunodominant regions of bot the S and N proteins. (Fig. 1A) Fig. S1 shows the resultant divalent recombinant nucleotide and protein sequences, which we sought to test for their immunogenicity.\n",
            " First, we produced and purified the fusion protein (termed 'VieVac') in E. coli. The recombinant protein containing a 6-His-tag was successfully purified by 8M urea. As shown in Fig. 1B ,C, the recombinant protein migrated at ~70 kDa, which is at the calculated cumulative molecular weight of the N100-300 aa (lane 3 in Fig. 1B,) and S300-685(lane 2 in Fig. 1B) . In addition to the entire 'VieVac' protein, a truncated fragment co-purified in most experiments due to a premature translation stop (lane 2 in Fig.   1C ).\n",
            " To evaluate whether the 'VieVac' protein would adsorb to AOH and AlPO4-based adjuvant (Imject™ Alum), immunoblotting of formulated 'VieVac' was performed after pelleting of the nanoparticulate structures by centrifugation. This revealed that the protein was recovered in its entirety in the particlecontaining pellet (Fig S2, lane 3) .\n",
            " In a second attempt, 'VieVac' production was performed in eukaryotic cells. This was motivated by the fact that the RBD is structurally composed of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel -fold, with strands and loops connecting the -strands, and is kept in its configuration by 4 disulfid bonds between 8 cysteins. Since this delicate type of folding develops better in eukaryotic cells, the recombinant gene fusion was re-engineered into the baculovirus system with the non-truncated protein successfully produced in Hi5 cells as demonstrated by immunofluorescence labelling 72 h after infection (Fig. 1D) .\n",
            " This protein could be purified through its N-terminal His-tag in its full length. Only minor degredation products co-purifed on Ni-NTA colums (Fig. 1E) .\n",
            " To reduce the required amount of the antigen, the recombinant fusion protein was adsorbed onto an AlOH and AlPO4-based adjuvant. First, mice (n = 4) were challenged with this immunogen in a standard regimen ( Fig. 2A ) (Wagner, Gessl et al., 1996) . Immunogen-challenged mice developed IgG by 14 days (nucleocapsid titer 10 -2 -5x10 -2 and RBD 10 -2 -10 -3 ) after the first dose, which increased to a significant IgG response to both antigens 28 days after the initial injection (nucleocapsid end-titer 10 -5 and RBD end-titer 5x10 -4 -10 -5 ) ( Fig. 2B-F) . None of the mice showed any adverse side effect, e.g. weight loss or neurological complications (data not shown). Mouse #1 had a shallow IgG response towards the nucleocapsid after the first booster injection (end-titer 10 -2 ) (Fig. 2B) . When receiving a second booster, this mouse also responded to the nucleocapsid when tested later ( Fig. 2D) with an end-titer of 10 -5 (Fig.   2E ).\n",
            " In order to investigate the durability of the IgG immunogen response, mice were kept under normal conditions and tested after 90 days for the mutant RBD of SARS-CoV-2 variants termed gamma (K417T and E484K) and delta (L452R and T478K). This revealed immune cross-reactivity of alpha RBD with the delta variant and significantly (p = 0.0138, 19%) reduced cross-reactivity with the gamma variant ( Fig. 2D) . Mouse #1 having received two booster injections showed similar reactivity towards both the alpha and delta variants.\n",
            " In a second study, 'VieVac' generated in a eukaryotic expression system was formulated with AddaVax™, an MF59 compatible adjuvant, which is approved in Europe and has been used in influenza vaccines (Mbow, De Gregorio et al., 2010) and beyond (Chappell, Mordant et al., 2021) . Mice (n = 13) were again challenged with 3 different doses of recombinant divalent antigen mixed with AddaVax™ according to the benchmarked immunization strategy used above (see Fig. 2A ). Ten out of thirteen recipients produced IgG against both proteins (nucleocapsid titer: 10 -2 -10 -3 and RBD titer :10 -2 -10 -3 ) after 14 days. Control mice received AddaVax™ only (n = 5). Fourteen days after a booster injection, 9\n",
            " out of the 13 test mice showed a further increase in their IgG responses to both antigens (nucleocapsid titer: 10 -4 -5x10 -5 and RBD titer: 5x10 -3 -10 -5 ) (Fig. 2E-F and Fig. 3A1-A2 ).\n",
            " Next, we tested mouse sera (n = 6) for individual IgG cross-reactivity against the virus variants gamma and delta. As compared to alpha, each serum IgG content was tested 14 days after booster injection for its reactivity against the mutant RBD (Fig. 3B) . The immune response (per IgG) varied amongst the mice but was reduced on average by 63% (p < 0.023) towards the gamma variant and 43% (nonsignificant) towards the delta variant, as compared to the alpha variant when measured at a titer of 10 -2 .\n",
            " However, similar end-titers were found for alpha, gamma-delta, and omicron variants, ranging from 5x10 -3 to 10 -4 , with the exception of one mouse in which the end-titer was an order of magnitude lower when alpha was compared with gamma, delta and omicron (Fig. 2F) . These data show that our #VieVac's trategy is equally efficient against all prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strains.\n",
            " Next, we addressed the effector potential of the constructs injected by analyzing cytotoxic lymphocytes (NK-T-cells), which have been suggested as the most important determinants of cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity. In peripheral blood, the AddaVax™/VieVac immunized group (n = 13) showed a 4.6fold (p < 0.013) granzyme A and a 4-fold (p < 0.005) perforin mRNA increase, as compared to the AddaVax only control group (n = 4). (Fig. 3C,D) . In order to investigate changes in the lymphocyte populations in the spleen, 20-25 mg of spleen tissue was homogenized, and RNA extracted. When analyzed for changes in target gene expression, changes did not reach the level of significance, even though an up-regulation in granzyme A expression was seen (Table S1 ). Fig. 3E2 ). The extent of activated CD8 + T-cells after stimulation with N-specific peptides (n = 13) and\n",
            " S-specific peptides (n = 13) was significant relative to the control group (AddaVax™ only, n = 5; p = 0.0127 and p = 0.0167 respectively. (Fig. 3E4-E5) . Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was used as a positive control to illustrate the spectrum of CD44 response to a nonspecific T-cell stimulant (Fig.   3E3, E6) . S-specific stimulated CD8 + T-cells showed significantly higher stimulation by PHA in terms of CD44 upregulation compared to control (p = 0.0177) (Fig. 3E6) . This suggests that a higher state of alertness to non-specific stimuli is induced within the CD8 + T-cells after S-specific peptide exposure.\n",
            " Neurological side effects have been observed following vaccination with authorized viral vector-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (Chun, Park et al., 2022 , Greinacher et al., 2021 , Sharifian-Dorche, Bahmanyar et al., 2021 , Zuhorn et al., 2021 . Particularly, cerebrovascular venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a subtype of stroke in which blood clots form and obstruct blood flow in the brain's vascular system (Stam, 2005) . These conditions combined with a COVID vaccine-related thrombocytopenia have been termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) (Greinacher et al., 2021 , Schultz, Sørvoll et al., 2021 and this has become one of the most important research areas of our time.\n",
            " No differences were detected in endothelial morphology or blood vessel density/distribution, between experimental groups (Fig. 4A-D,) (Härtig, Reichenbach et al., 2009) . Reduced capillary staining, the presence of plaques, and ramified (activated) microglia were not detected either. Likewise, the distribution, density or morphology of microglia and astrocytes (Fig. S6A-D) also remained unchanged ( Fig. 4A-D) (Bignami, Eng et al., 1972 , Sasaki, Ohsawa et al., 2001 . No differences were observed in the cell number of neurons in selected brain areas either (Fig. 4E-F and S5) . These data support the notion that 'VieVac', at least in preclinical models, is unlikely to cause adverse neuropathological sideeffects.\n",
            " This study provides a proof-of-concept approach for the generation of divalent (or even polyvalent) protein backbones for the development of protein vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 taking advantage of the coincident presence of the most immunogenic viral regions hinged by flexible linkers to maintain ternary and quaternary structures. The construct design incorporates a rapidly mutating region (RBD) and a constitutive region (nucleocapsid), thus overcoming strain-specific hindrances in immunogenicity as increasingly seen for linearized mRNA vaccines.\n",
            " The RBD region is the backbone of all vaccination strategies presently available, even if its inferiority upon rapidly mutating SARS-CoV2 is already apparent. Since conformation-specific antibody responses may be important in immune defense against SARS-CoV2, recombinant proteins generated in eukaryotic systems are the tools of choice. This is significant because the RBD domain has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel ß-fold with strands and loops connecting its ß-strands. This fold could be resolved by crystallography of the RBD produced in Hi5 insect cells (Lan, Ge et al., 2020) . There are 9 cysteines in this region, 8 of which are involved in disulfide bond formation in order to generate the ACE-2 binding structure. Here, we show that insect bioreactor systems could also be amenable to producing vaccine backbones. Particularly, our molecular design incorporates 8 cysteines from the RBD region (300-685 aa), thus likely stabilizing the ternary structure of the protein to increase its recognition by the host's immune system, a feature likely contributing to a near-maximal immune response already at the second booster stage. In contrast, relatively limited emphasis has been directed towards the welltranscribed nucleocapsid protein in presently pursued SARS-CoV2 vaccine strategies in Europe and beyond, even if the nucleocapsid of other coronaviruses was earlier recognized for its immunogenicity (Boots, Kusters et al., 1991) . This lack of interest is surprising since 11% of human CD4+ T-cells and 12% of CD8+ T-cells recognize the nucleocapsid in individuals with SARS-CoV2 infection (Grifoni, Weiskopf et al., 2020) , supporting its immunogenic potential to generate potent immunoprotection by expanding surveillance to cellular branches of defense in humans.\n",
            " A homologue of an EDA-approved adjuvant was used to increase efficacy, which was in terms of T-cell response near-complete after a second booster, alike by others (Chappell et al., 2021) , and reached 100% upon a third inoculation in a staggered primer-booster regimen. The fact that high immunogenicity is detected even after 90 days in a mouse immunization model with near-equivalent efficacy against the alpha, delta and omicron strains when measuring the end-titer gives confidence in the correctness of this design strategy. Immunological analysis of lymphocytes harvested from the spleen of immunized animals showed a significant T-cell response as indicated by the significant upregulation of granzyme A and perforin, cytotoxic granule effector molecules, in peripheral lymphocytes. An increased expression of CD44 upon N-and S-specific peptide stimulation ex vivo demonstrated the generation of T-cells capable of executing cellular protection and production of interleucins (Tian, Patel et al., 2021) .\n",
            " Given the brevity of time for our compressed proof-of-concept workflow, we recognize that data on the generation of neutralizing antibodies, whose presence is assigned to immunity against the RBD ('spike') protein, is as yet lacking. However, and equally importantly, cellular immunity through T-cell responses is recognized as an essential means of protection. Accordingly, the adoptive transfer of T-cells into immunodeficient mice led to rapid recovery after the transfer of SARS-CoV-specific effector cells (Zhao, Zhao et al., 2009) . Similar results are seen in ferrets, in which neutralizing antibodies do not fully protect against SARS-CoV2-induced disease. Instead, nasal immunity, which is reliant on T-cell responses together with the presence of antibodies, seems to carry optimal protection (See, Petric et al., 2008) . Notably, nucleocapsid-related B-cell immunity has also been shown earlier , Pajenda et al., 2021 , Shrock, Fujimura et al., 2020 , and even served as a diagnostic tool because the detection of nucleocapsid-specific IgG in conjunction with RBDspecific IgG differentiated SARS-CoV2 exposure from a pure mRNA-based vaccine response.\n",
            " Therefore, the pronounced B-cell responses shown here support the hypothesis that both viral protein fragments of our divalent construct can provoke significant cellular immunity. Considering that the immunogenic peptides are native viral sequences (and neither forward nor reverse-engineered fragments that could curb immunogenicity), we view the B-and T-cell responses described here as minimally required yet sufficient experimental indices of our molecular design strategy to trigger significant protection against SARS-CoV2.\n",
            " In conclusion, we propose that the above molecular design together with biological data on the efficacy of the administered divalent recombinant protein outline a rational approach to generate an efficient protein vaccine pipeline (which we term as a prototypic \"VieVac\" vaccine), which can be built on both eukaryotic and prokaryotic bioreactors for scaleable production. The bivalent protein/adjuvant-based immunization is effective in eliciting humoral and cellular immunoresponses upon application in a prime-booster mode. Given that the repeated administration of \"VieVac\" evoked no side effects in the nervous system, we emphasize the safety of a protein-based vaccine. \n",

            " This manuscript has a data supplement Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) has also been reported after adenoviral 8 COVID-19 vaccines. 5 These reports led to vaccine hesitancy among patients with 9 thrombocytopenic disorders including immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP), a 10 relapsing, thrombotic microangiopathy caused by antibody mediated severe ADAMTS13 11 deficiency. These concerns were further compounded by reports of de novo and relapsed iTTP 12 following mRNA vaccines. 6-10 Whether SARS CoV-2 vaccination is associated with iTTP 13 recurrence has significant clinical implications; however, this has not been systematically 14 investigated. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to evaluate the safety of 15 SARS-CoV2 vaccination in patients with pre-existing iTTP. To estimate the incidence of iTTP 16 (de novo and relapsed) after vaccination, we examined cases of iTTP after COVID-19 17 vaccination reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the US passive 18 surveillance system for adverse events after immunization. 11\n",

Details of iTTP and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and available laboratory data including 23 platelet counts and ADAMTS13 activity before and after vaccination were extracted from the 1 medical record. The primary outcome was iTTP relapse characterized by a platelet count <150 x 2 10 9 /L and microangiopathic hemolysis with ADAMTS13 activity < 10 % occurring within 4 3 weeks of vaccination, the typical window for post-vaccine autoimmune hematologic 4 complications. 12 We separately report iTTP relapses occurring at > 4 weeks after vaccination. 5 We also examined change in ADAMTS13 activity and platelet counts before and after 6 vaccination.\n",
            " Additionally, we searched the VAERS database for reports of adults (age > 18 years) 8 who developed iTTP after receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Individual reports were reviewed by 9 two independent investigators to determine whether these were consistent with iTTP. We 10 categorized cases as definite iTTP (documented severe ADAMTS13 deficiency), probable iTTP 11 (presentation and treatment compatible with iTTP but ADAMTS13 not reported), and possible 12 iTTP (presentation and treatment possibly compatible with iTTP but inadequate information to 13 make a definitive determination). Cases more compatible with alternative diagnoses such as ITP 14 or VITT were excluded. 100%). iTTP relapse within 4 weeks of vaccination occurred in one patient (1.3%), a 28-year-old 23 female at 1.5 years from her initial iTTP episode who did not recover ADAMTS13 activity at all 1 (<2%) during remission. Six days after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she developed 2 bruising, petechiae, ataxia, and slurred speech. Laboratory testing revealed thrombocytopenia, 3 schistocytes, and undetectable ADAMTS13 activity. She was successfully treated with 4 caplacizumab, rituximab, and corticosteroids without plasma exchange based on our prior 5 experience treating early relapse with this regimen. 13 She received the second dose of the Pfizer 6 vaccine uneventfully after ADAMTS 13 activity was > 20%. Another three patients were treated 7 for iTTP recurrences between 35 to 143 days after vaccination, which are less likely to be 8 associated with vaccination (Table S1 ). The incidence of iTTP relapse over the entire 9 observation period after vaccination was 0.095 per patient-year. 10 We next examined the VAERS database for de novo and relapsed iTTP after COVID-19 Johnson vaccine (0.244 per million). While the temporal relationship of several cases occurring 23 within a month of vaccination is concerning for an association, the estimated incidence is not 1 higher than the incidence of iTTP in the United States (1.7 to 3.7 per million). 15, 16 2 De novo and relapsed iTTP have been reported after various vaccines 17-19 , including 3 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 6-10 , where the association is supported by absence of another proximate 4 cause and a temporal relationship with most cases occurring between 5 -15 days after 5 vaccination. Most cases of iTTP following COVID-19 vaccination in VAERS occurred within 6 14 days after vaccination, which is concerning for a possible association. In our cohort, three of 7 four patients with iTTP recurrence presented >30 days after vaccination arguing against vaccine-8 induced autoimmunity in these cases, though it must be noted that VITT has been reported up to 9 48 days after vaccination 5 so an association with iTTP relapse after 30 days is plausible and may 10 apply to the patient who had a relapse 35 days after the second vaccine dose (table S1).\n",
            " Vaccination could precipitate acute iTTP in patients who already have low ADAMTS13. This is 12 supported by the observation that ADAMTS13 deficiency is necessary but not sufficient for TTP 13 and that the only relapses in our cohort occurred in individuals with low/unknown ADAMTS13 14 activity within 3 months prior. Our combined cohort is relatively mature, and we offer 15 preemptive rituximab to patients with ADAMTS13 activity <20% during clinical remission, 16 which may explain the high pre-vaccination ADAMTS13 activity and corresponding low relapse 17 rate. Patients in clinical remission without ADAMTS13 remission 20 might be at increased risk 18 for relapse 21,22 following COVID-19 vaccination. We check ADAMTS13 activity every 3 19 months in all patients to estimate risk of recurrence (including post-vaccination). We recommend 20 checking a platelet count and ADAMTS13 activity weekly for 2-4 weeks after vaccination in 21 those with lowADAMTS13 activity (<20-30%). 22 1 medical record. However, we are unable to report other vaccine-associated adverse events since 2 these were not consistently documented. A limitation of VAERS data is that some cases have 3 limited clinical and laboratory information (including ADAMTS13). 23 To address this challenge, 4 we categorized cases based on certainty of the TTP diagnosis. Finally, VAERS is a passive 5 surveillance system and iTTP after vaccination may be underreported, 23 which is a limitation. To 6 avoid underestimating incidence, we included all reported cases of iTTP (rather than only 7 ADAMTS13 cases) and used only fully vaccinated individuals as the denominator.\n",
            " In summary, data from a large multicenter cohort and VAERS appear to be reassuring 9 that COVID-19 vaccination does not increase risk of de novo or relapsed iTTP except in 10 individuals with extremely low ADAMTS13 activity (<20%) in remission. Prospective studies to 11 confirm this finding are needed. Until then, these data may help individuals with iTTP and their 12 physicians make informed decisions about vaccination. \n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel communicable disease. Along with nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce human-to-human transmissions, the COVID-19 vaccine is the primary strategy to help contain infection, decrease morbidity, and reduce loss of life. The U.S. began its first vaccine distribution on December 14, 2020, and more than 172.2 million Americans (52.4% population) were fully vaccinated as of August 26, 2021 [1] . However, vaccine hesitancy has been an obstacle to reaching herd immunity [2] .\n",
            " Government agencies and health authorities need information to assess and respond to public sentiment about vaccination, both acceptance and hesitancy. For simplicity, the term acceptance is used to encompass both acceptance and hesitancy. Prior studies have estimated vaccine hesitancy by asking respondents' willingness to receive vaccines [3] - [5] . Early survey-based studies used general wording that focused on certain groups to formulate an assessment for adolescent and childhood vaccine hesitancy [6] , [7] . With a deeper understanding of vaccine hesitancy, recent studies have integrated more aspects [4] , [5] and collected responses through a variety of techniques, such as online tools [8] , telephone interviews [9] , and systematic literature reviews [10] .\n",
            " Among these survey-based models, the \"3C\" (confidence, complacency, convenience) model and the Working Group Determinants of Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix were widely applied, both of which were developed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) at the World Health Organization (World Health Organization (WHO) SAGE, 2014). The \"3C\" model focuses on measuring the \"3C's lens\" and identifies barriers within the community. In contrast, the Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix emphasizes external factors (e.g., culture, society, environment, and health aspects) derived from literature reviews and expert opinions. Other commonly applied indices include, for high-income countries, the Global Vaccine Confidence Index [12] and the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale [13] ; and, for the low-and middle-income countries, the Caregiver Vaccine Acceptance Scale [14] .\n",
            " In the context of COVID-19, recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of survey tools to measure the acceptance of vaccination [15] , [16] and to understand its driving factors. In particular, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) applied the Household Pause Survey (HPS) to evaluate vaccine hesitancy [17] . They used survey results to estimate state-level hesitancy rates and then applied a \"downscaling\" method to predict county-level hesitancy rates based on the Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) [17] . The final result for each county is an estimate of the percentage of the population that may be vaccine-hesitant.\n",
            " Survey-based methods have also been applied to assist the assessment of vaccine acceptance [5] , [18] - [20] . These may target specific groups (e.g., parents [7] , [21] , healthcare providers [22] ) and specific places. Therefore, these methods may provide limited insights on broad public perceptions of vaccine acceptance at different geographical scales. Developing survey-based indices for a wide application may demand a commitment of long-term investigation and a large effort to collect representative responses.\n",
            " Collecting information from social media platforms, in contrast, can cover large geographical areas at comparatively low cost. Although these data may be of lower fidelity than survey questions, they can be obtained almost instantaneously. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, social media have been a forum for vaccine-related public discourse where opinions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines circulate rapidly [23] .\n",
            " Opinions expressed on social media provide data resources that can be leveraged to rapidly assess vaccine acceptance.\n",
            " Existing studies using social media data to assess opinions related to vaccines mainly evaluate vaccinerelated contents through semantic analysis or sentiment analysis [24] - [26] . They have captured online opinions (e.g., pro-or anti-vaccine campaigns) to help health organizations more readily recognize prevalent vaccination messages [27] - [29] . Other studies have discussed the role of social media in enhancing vaccine confidence [30] , [31] . For example, Rosen et al [31] found a positive correlation between social media engagement and HPV vaccine awareness. The study suggested that enhancing the connection between health organizations and the public through social media can help disseminate vaccine information strategically.\n",
            " Studies that attempt to estimate vaccine acceptance using social media data are less common than survey studies. Piedrahita-Valdés et al. [32] applied sentiment analysis to estimate global vaccine hesitancy using Twitter data for all types of vaccines from 2011 to 2019. They found that the percentage of neutral tweets showed a decreasing tendency, while the percentage positive and negative tweets increased over time. Johnson et al. [33] investigated 100 million Facebook users expressing opinions regarding vaccination to study the evolution of pro-and anti-vaccine clusters from February to October 2019. To classify the clusters, they manually reviewed Facebook pages and identified whether each page was part of a pro-or anti-vaccination cluster. The study found that anti-vaccination clusters managed to become highly entangled and dominated in Facebook networks.\n",
            " The broad set of studies seeking to leverage social media have demonstrated the potential of these data to investigate online messages regarding vaccine acceptance. However, most prior studies have applied sentiment and other textual analysis to indicate vaccine acceptance qualitatively, but not to estimate acceptance quantitatively, and across different geographical regions. Further, there has been little discussion of the reliability of social media data in assessing vaccine acceptance.\n",
            " To fill the research gaps, the present study explores the utility of social media data to render quick indication of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The primary objectives are to, 1. Explore whether social media is a reliable indicator of vaccine acceptance as validated through later vaccination rates in the context of COVID-19.\n",
            " 2. Discuss specific circumstances in which social media data generate a reliable estimate of vaccine acceptance (e.g., length of time to collect data, number of users to include, granularity of the analysis).\n",
            " The study addresses the above two objectives via the analysis of Twitter data related to COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. Specifically, the study proposes a vaccine acceptance index (VAI) to quantify online opinions towards vaccination. The study includes temporal and spatial analysis to validate the reliability of conclusions from social media data against vaccination rates published by official channels. The intent is to monitor vaccine acceptance across different geographical areas with rapidity, broad spatial coverage, and cost-effectiveness.\n",
            " The concepts of acceptance, hesitancy, and uptake appear in a breadth of vaccine literature. While the specific definitions used in a study may differ, the present study uses the following definitions. Vaccine acceptance is taken as the individual or group decision to accept or refuse when presented with an opportunity to vaccinate [34] . Vaccine hesitancy refers to situations where people have doubts or concerns toward vaccinations, without referring to actual vaccine receipt [34] . Vaccine uptake refers to the proportion of a population that has received a specific vaccine. Unlike vaccine uptake which is an objective measure, vaccine acceptance and vaccine hesitancy consider people's willingness to accept or refuse when presented the opportunity to vaccinate [35] .\n",
            " The research framework is illustrated in Fig. 1 . It starts with data preparation, which involves collecting English-language tweets containing the keyword \"vaccine\" and appearing from August 9, 2020, to April 18, 2021. For consistency, this search word choice was maintained throughout the study window even if additional words and phrases began to be used later in the study. For example, the word \"vaccination,\" might also be contained in tweets expressing people's opinions towards COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.\n",
            " However, \"vaccination\" is typically used to refer to receiving or administering the vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccination efforts did not begin until December 14, 2020 [1] (approximately halfway through the study window).\n",
            " To develop the training set, a set of the 15,000 most frequently occurring tweets were sampled from the tweet pool. These were manually labeled (i.e., classified into one of three categories) by the authors, as documented in Section 2.2. Then, a random sample of 2,000 unique tweets (distinct from the training tweet samples) was selected and manually labeled (using the same criteria for labeling as applied to the training samples) to build the testing set. Following the creation of the training and testing sets, a text augmentation technique was used to balance the training set, generating a larger augmented dataset with an approximately balanced sample distribution between three label categories, as described in Section 2.2.4.\n",
            " Text classification pipelines were developed to classify a tweet into one of three categories of opinion toward the COVID-19 vaccine: positive, negative, or unrelated. The construction of the text classification pipelines is described in Section 2.3. The initial training set and the augmented training set were used to train nine candidate text classification pipelines (including two sentiment tools). Recall, Precision, F1-score, and Accuracy -defined in Section 2.3.4 -were used to measure the performance of each model on the testing set.\n",
            " The best-performing pipeline was applied to the entire dataset to label all available tweets. Then, a vaccine acceptance index (VAI) was developed to measure the online level of vaccine acceptance in a geographic area during a particular period (Section 2.4). This VAI for a particular region requires information regarding the location of individual Twitter users. Section 2.5 explains the process of location identification. \n",
            " The Twitter Standard Search API [36] was used with the search term \"vaccine\" and geocode \"39.8, -95.583, 2500 km\" [37] to scrape vaccine-related tweets in the date range from August 9, 2020 to April 18, 2021 over the geographic area covered by the geocode. This geocode parameter value is specified by \"latitude, longitude, radius,\" and it returns tweets by users located within a radius of 2,500 km of the center 39.8, -95.583. The study selected this date range after the announcement of the first COVID-19 vaccine made by the Russian government on August 8, 2020, and before the U.S. mass vaccination started on April 19, 2021. The search word \"vaccine\" would return tweets that mentioned COVID-19 vaccine, but some fraction of the returned tweets was not COVID-19 related (e.g., HPV vaccine, flu vaccine). The latter were labeled as unrelated. The downloaded tweets included original tweets, mentions (i.e., a tweet that quotes another user's username), replies (i.e., a comment to another user's tweet), and retweets (i.e., a reposting of a tweet) that contained the keyword \"vaccine.\" The geographic search range was restricted to continental North America with the given geocode to investigate the U.S. public's response to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
            " The resulting dataset contains 29,213,502 English language tweets.\n",
            " To classify users' opinions towards the COVID-19 vaccine, the most frequently occurring 15,000 tweets were selected (i.e., the 15,000 unique tweets retweeted the most) and manually classified each tweet into a \"positive (class 1),\" \"negative (class -1),\" or \"unrelated (class 0)\" about COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
            " Sentiment analysis was not used to classify the tweets because it was judged that sentiment score might not represent the user's opinion in the research context. For example, the tweet \"Rich people did not experience the same pandemic as working-class people and now they get the vaccine first. It's actually twisted\" is identified as negative using sentiment analysis, but it does not necessarily imply that this user was negative about the COVID-19 vaccine. A prior study also reveals the difference between sentiment and opinion mining in the text [38] .\n",
            " The criteria for manual labeling are based on the CDC strategy to reinforce confidence in COVID-19 vaccines [39] . Table 1 illustrates the specific labeling criteria used and examples. Tweets discussing vaccine passport (the second example in the class \"unrelated\" in Table 1 ) were labeled as unrelated (class 0) given that a Twitter user could possibly oppose to the vaccine passport while accepting the vaccine. Rich people did not experience the same pandemic as working class people and now they get the vaccine first. It's actually twisted.\n",
            " No vaccine passport. It doesn't get much more dystopian than being required to show your \"health papers\" wherever you go.\n",
            " Even with a vaccine, I'll still be wearing a mask and continuing cleaning and social distancing. I ain't had a cold or nothing since March.\n",
            " The manual classification process considered the 15,000 unique tweets that were retweeted the most, but subsequent analysis incorporated classifications for all retweets, given that online users who retweeted a tweet were presumed to share the same opinion as the original tweet. Each tweet in the training set was labeled by two annotators. When a tweet received the same label from both annotators, it was considered as the final label for this tweet. When there was a disagreement, the label was finalized through a short discussion by the annotators. As a result, there are 13,624 tweets (90.8% of training data) that received the same labels from two annotators, and the rate of variation between two annotators is 9.1% ((15000-13624)/15000). The manual labeling process resulted in a training set of 4,092 positive tweets (class 1), 1,783 negative tweets (class -1), and 9,125 unrelated tweets (class 0).\n",
            " Next, 2,000 unique tweets were randomly selected (different from the training set), and the same label criteria was used to build the testing set. As a result, the rate of variation is 8.1% ((2000-1837)/2000), and the testing set contained 492 positive tweets (class 1), 224 negative tweets (class -1), and 1,284 unrelated tweets (class 0). The training and testing sets were used for building and assessing the performance of a text classification model. In particular, the manually labeled samples in the testing set were considered as the \"ground-truth\" values and used to measure the classification performance of different candidate models.\n",
            " Before text classification, several steps were applied to clean the tweets. First, short URLs, user names (@username), the retweet prefix (RT @username), digits, emojis, and punctuations were removed. Next, each tweet was tokenized into a list of separate words and characters. Then the tokenized words were converted to their stemming forms (lemmatization). The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) python package was used to complete the text cleaning [40] .\n",
            " Imbalance in the training set (9,125 class 0 tweets, 4,092 class 1 tweets, and 1,783 class -1 tweets) might pose an issue for the text classification process in that the trained model could classify a random tweet as class 0 to obtain a high testing accuracy. As a result, the trained model might not produce an adequate performance for the minority class. There are two practical methods to tackle this issue, downsampling and upsampling. Downsampling balances classes by training on a small subset of the majority class samples, while upsampling balances classes by increasing the size of the minority class samples. Since downsampling might lead to a loss of information for the model to capture \"unrelated\" tweet information, upsampling was used to balance the training samples.\n",
            " The easy data augmentation (EDA) technique was selected to perform upsampling since it does not require a model pre-trained on an external dataset [41] . The EDA technique uses four operations to increase the text sample size: 1) synonym replacement (random words in a text are replaced by a synonym), 2) random insertion (random words are inserted into the text), 3) random swap (randomly swap two words in the text), and 4) random deletion (randomly delete words in the text) [41] . \n",
            " Sentiment classification, although it is different from opinion classification, was used to test the credibility of opinion classification. Sentiment classification tools use natural language processing (NLP)\n",
            " to analyze conversations and classify text into a positive, negative, or neutral emotional category. This study applied two popular Python-based sentiment tools, Textblob and Vader (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner). Textblob is a free Python library for processing textual data and provides a simple integrated and convenient API for diving into sentiment analysis [42] .\n",
            " Vader is an open-sourced and lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool under MIT license that is attuned to the sentiment expressed in social media [43] .\n",
            " Text vectorization converts text into a vector or a matrix of vectors of numbers. Two text vectorization approaches were applied: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Word Embedding methods. TF-IDF is a term weighting method used to perform text similarity, text classification, and information retrieval [44] . The key formula of TF-IDF is,\n",
            " in which denotes the word 's weight in tweet ; represents the frequency of word in tweet ( , )\n",
            " , is the total number of tweets; and is the number of tweets in which word appears. Although TF-;\n",
            " IDF does not capture word position or semantic similarity, it is an efficient algorithm for matching words in a query to documents [45] . Due to its simplicity and fast computation, TF-IDF is useful when dealing with a large set of textual data.\n",
            " Unlike TF-IDF, word embedding techniques can help capture semantic meanings [46] , which may be used to compute text similarity and perform text classification. Word embedding methods convert each word into a vector of real numbers. Two popular pre-trained word embedding methods were applied in this study: FastText [47] and Global Vectors (GloVe) [48] . FastText applied in this research was pre-trained on Wikipedia based on 300 dimensions [47] . GloVe was trained based on Twitter content and each word was mapped using 300-dimensionals [53] .\n",
            " Multi-class classification involves more than two classes. In this study, the target domain contains three classes: class 1 (positive), class -1 (negative), and class 0 (unrelated). After each word in a tweet was converted to a vector using the TF-IDF method or word embedding methods, different machine learning classifiers were applied to classify each tweet into one of the three classes.\n",
            " Classifiers used in this study were Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). These are well machine learning classifiers and can be used in conjunction with the TF-IDF text vectorization method. Pipelines using these classifiers combined with the TF-IDF technique were constructed based on the Scikit-learn Python library [50] . The TF-IDF method converts a tweet into a vector of features; however, word embedding techniques convert each word in a tweet into an n-dimensional vector based on the pretrained dataset. Thus, each tweet sample is represented as a matrix, with each column denoting the word vector. Given that the input to a classification model is a matrix, it usually requires deep learning techniques (e.g., neural networks) to deal with such classification tasks. In this study, the LSTM model was applied for text classification in conjunction with word embeddings. The implementation was constructed with the Keras Python library [51] .\n",
            " Ultimately, two sentiment-based classifiers (Textblob and Vader), five vector-based machine-learning based classifiers (TF-IDF + DT, TF-IDF + RF, TF-IDF + NB, TF-IDF + SVM, and TF-IDF + LR) and two deep-learning classifiers (FastText + LSTM and GloVe + LSTM) were considered as candidate models.\n",
            " The nine candidate models were trained using the manual classified training data (with and without upsampling), and performance was assessed using the \"unseen\" 2,000 tweets contained in the testing set.\n",
            " Each of these machine learning classifiers contains hyperparameters that control the learning process. The grid search method was applied to tune the hyperparameters and to search for the ideal model architecture.\n",
            " The parameter range of grid search for different classifiers is presented in Table 2 . Precision, Recall, and F1-score were used to assess the classification performance on the testing data.\n",
            " Precision measures the fraction of true positive cases over the retrieved cases a model predicts. Recall is the fraction of true positive cases over all the relevant cases that are actually identified. The F1-score is a rating of test accuracy, combining Recall and Precision [52] . They are defined as:\n",
            " (2) = + Using grid search, different hyperparameters listed in Table 2 were tuned to achieve an idea architecture for each machine learning classifier. The best hyperparameter combination for each classifier was selected mainly based on F1-scores and testing accuracy. Performance on the testing dataset of these classification models with the best tuned hyperparameters is shown in Table 3 for both the original and upsampled training sets.\n",
            " The TF-IDF + RF trained on an augmented training set offered the best performance overall and therefore was applied to the whole dataset in subsequent steps. The performance of some models improved but some reduced when dealing with the augmented training set, according to the F1-scores. One possible explanation is that the text augmentation added more samples to balance the classes but also introduced more information to the training process (e.g., more words with synonym change, and more training samples with the same classification). However, with sample balance, most models showed an improvement on class 1 and class -1. In particular, the performance of some models (built with NB and RF)\n",
            " for class -1 greatly improved with sample balance, as demonstrated by a higher F1-score.\n",
            " Second, pipelines using word embedding techniques were not consistently superior to those built on TF-IDF even those word-embedding methods are often considered more advanced. In applications such as those in this study, it is crucial to discriminate between words with similar meanings. However, the word embedding techniques may contain too much hidden information that is difficult to understand by the machine.\n",
            " Third, the performance of sentiment classification tools was barely satisfactory, as demonstrated by lower F1-score and testing accuracy. As discussed, in applications of mining opinions from social media data, sentiment scores may not sufficiently reflect users' opinions, especially when involving complex context (e.g., irony, metaphor). \n",
            " The selected classification model TF-IDF + DT trained on the upsampled training dataset was applied to 29,213,502 tweets contained in the full dataset. A classification was assigned to each tweet and used to compute a user-based vaccine acceptance measure. The following index was proposed to measure vaccine acceptance in geographic area during a particular period. Vaccine acceptance was defined for a specific Twitter user during time-period ( ) as: , \n",
            " The regional vaccine acceptance index requires information regarding the location of individual Twitter users. There are two types of information that can be leveraged to identify a user's location: (1) a user posting geolocation information (latitude/longitude) as part of a public tweet, and (2) a user providing registration location (i.e., home location) as part of their public profile. While geolocation tied to a tweet provides the most robust location information, only a small proportion of tweets in the dataset (18,806 out of 29,213,502 or 0.06% of tweets) were associated with latitude and longitude. This does not provide sufficient data to reveal the temporal and spatial patterns of interest. However, Twitter allows users to register home locations in their user profile. More than half (16,334,206 out of 29,213,502 or 55.9%) of tweets in the dataset had registration locations indicating either U.S. state or city. Therefore, registration location was used to ensure sufficient data for temporal and spatial analysis.\n",
            " To identify state and county information from registration profiles, a simple word mapping was applied based on a list of U.S. locations (cities, counties, state names, and state codes) obtained from SimpleMaps.com [53] . For example, the following registration locations, \"California, USA,\" \"CA,\" and \"California,\" indicate the State of California. Other registration locations may contain more specific location information, such as city or county. For example, the following locations, \"Los Angeles, CA\" \"New York City,\" \"Orlando,\" and \"Houston, TX,\" contain city information. Location information was used to identify the user's profile state and, if possible, the user's profile county. If a registration location contained only city information, it was referred to its corresponding county and state. For example, if a user's registration location is \"Seattle,\" then the county information for this location was identified as \"King County\" and the state is identified as \"Washington.\" Using this approach, a Python code was developed by the authors, and 16,334,206 records were extracted containing state information for nation-level and statelevel analysis and 8,885,549 records containing the county information for county-level analysis.\n",
            " Some limitations of this application are noted. First, this approach cannot identify locations that were not presented in the list of U.S. locations obtained from SimpleMaps.com, such as \"Times Square\" or \"Long Island.\" Second, this approach only returns the last location information when a user's profile contains multiple locations. For example, if the registration location includes two locations such as \"LA and NYC,\" the method will only identify the last location \"NYC\" and refers it to the county and state information \"New York, NY.\" Third, it cannot capture nouns of locality in the users' registration locations, such as \"near,\" \"between,\" \"north to,\" and \"close to.\" Last, this approach returns the county and state information with the most populated area when the user's input only contains the city name that may refer to multiple locations in the U.S. For example, a user's input of \"Portland\" can refer to a city in Oregon, Maine, Colorado, Texas, Tennessee, or Indiana. This approach generates the county and state information as \"Multnomah, Oregon\"\n",
            " given that the Portland city in Oregon has the largest population among these cities.\n",
            " The volume of positive-and negative-classified tweets over time is shown in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows the national VAI computed each day and on a 7-day rolling average. For the daily values (blue line in Fig. 2b) , a clear rising trend in observed during the study period. This characterization appears consistent with survey results on 7,420 American adults indicating that vaccine hesitancy declined by 10.8% from October 2020 to March 2021 [15] . It is also consistent with national poll results reported by Nguyen et al. [16] which showed that the intent to receive COVID-19 vaccination increased from 39.4% to 49.1% among adults and across all priority groups from September to December 2020.\n",
            " In addition to providing insights on overall trends, VAI provides insights regarding public reactions to vaccine-related events. Given that Twitter users responded to news events by posting personal opinions and event observations, the index is likely to reflect events and the availability of vaccine information (e.g., clinical trial results regarding vaccine safety and efficacy). Fig. 3 shows the same daily time-series with notable events annotated.\n",
            " For example, the national VAI moved from negative acceptance to the positive range, and the volume of positive tweets increased in early November. Pfizer published its trial efficacy result on November 9, 2020. Before this date, the overall opinions on vaccine acceptance fluctuated between negative and neutral.\n",
            " Other notable events or opinions potentially contributing to changes in vaccine acceptance might have included: (1) scientists worried that the government put political pressure on the FDA to approve the vaccine without referencing the clinical data, and (2) the U.S. rejected joining the WHO's COVID-19 vaccine initiative [54] . After the trial data became available from Pfizer, the VAI increased to 0.8 and remained consistently high throughout the study period (April 19, 2021) . Near the end of the study period, a significant negative spike was observed in Fig. 3 , which coincides temporally and thus may be associated with the pause of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to the report of blood clots on April 13, 2021 [55] . \n",
            " The relationship between the VAI and later vaccination rates was explored at the state level. As described in Section 3.4, tweets were extracted for state-level locations at which information could be obtained. Tweets were grouped based on extracted locations to calculate the state-level index using equation 7. The 7-day VAI in each state was compared with the national-level trend (Fig. 4a) . In each subplot, the grey dotted line is the rolling weekly national trend, and the blue line and yellow lines show state-level trend with the color denoting whether the state-level VAI is above (blue) or below (yellow) the national VAI. Detrended state-level 7-day VAI were obtained by subtracting the national VAI. This provides a clearer view of the changes in each state. In both Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b , the x-axis represents the study period, and the y-axis represents the VAI (Fig. 4a) or difference in VAI (state VAI minus national VAI) (Fig. 4b) . Other events potentially contributing to the evolution of vaccine acceptance include positive results from vaccine clinical trials, FDA's approval of the emergency use authorization [56] , vaccinations of frontline healthcare workers [57] , and quick vaccine distribution across the U.S. [58] . These interactions between the Twitter-derived national VAI and the events suggest that social media could serve as an effective tool to reflect online opinions and support near real-time tracking of vaccine acceptance. lower than the national level. Some states (e.g., SD, IA, AR, TN, MS, AL, and GA) had a higher acceptance index at the beginning but dropped afterward. Other states (e.g., WA, OR, CA, WI, and MT) were more negative in the first few months but later turned positive. Fig. 4 . 7-day rolling average of the state-level VAI (a) compared with the national VAI (y-axis is the VAI value and x-axis is the date across the full study period), and (b) with detrended from the national VAI (y-axis is the difference between state-level VAI and national VAI, and x-axis is the date across the full study period).\n",
            " Correlations were calculated between the Twitter-derived VAI and the cumulative vaccination rate [1] at the state level. This aimed to: (1) measure the potential value of using the social media-derived index to understand future vaccination rates at the state level, and (2) determine conditions when the Twitter-derived VAI shows a strong correlation to vaccination rate. Fig. 5a -c shows the correlation coefficient calculated between the daily (Fig. 5a) , 7-day rolling average (Fig. 5b) , and 30-day rolling average (Fig. 5c) state-level VAI and the corresponding state's vaccination rates on June 22, 2021. The data for vaccination rates were obtained from CDC COVID-19 Data Tracker [1] . The regression line between time and the correlation coefficient is shown by the dotted trend line (with associated values applying to the whole regression line annotated on the graphs).\n",
            " As expected, the VAI calculated using more recent data shows a stronger positive correlation with the June vaccination rates. It was further observed that calculating the VAI over a more extended time (monthly rolling average) generates a more stable relationship. The correlation is higher after the first vaccine distribution, which occurred on December 14, 2020, as indicated by the yellow boxes on Fig. 5c . This suggests that, at the state-level, the online opinions on vaccine acceptance expressed after the initial vaccine rollout are more strongly related to later vaccination rates.\n",
            " To further explore the temporal change in correlation between vaccination rates and the 30-day VAI, the correlation analysis was repeated using vaccination rates on three dates: \n",
            " County-level VAI was computed as the average of the acceptance levels of all users from that county in a given period, where the county assigned to a particular user was determined from profile information.\n",
            " However, increased spatial discretization means there were fewer data available for each spatial unit (county). Fig. 6a presents the distribution of Twitter users by county. Fig. 6b shows county-level VAI computed across the period after the first vaccine distribution (December 14, 2020, to April 18, 2021) for counties with more than 30 users. Fig. 6c . County-level vaccination rates for Texas and selected counties in California were not available. The change in correlation with number of users in a county was based on two scenarios: (1) using all the data in the study period, and (2) using data after the first vaccine distribution. The results are presented in Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Compared to VAI, the survey-based downsampling method shows higher correlation. Still, the surveybased approach requires a larger commitment of time and resources and does not offer the same ability to track vaccine hesitancy over a long period or to see effects such as the impact of newsworthy events on opinions.\n",
            " While vaccination is the most successful public health intervention to contain infectious diseases, strategies are needed to rapidly assess vaccine acceptance. Survey-based methods have been applied to index, which appears consistent with survey studies that indicate vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. declined from October 2020 to March 2021 [15] . The study further explores the correlation of VAI with vaccination rates at the state, and county levels.\n",
            " From a theoretical perspective, the present study contributes to research focusing on information extraction from social media data. First, it provides insights into natural language processing tools to perform multi-class classification tasks on social media data. In this context, the TF-IDF method may be as effective as more advanced word embedding methods, possibly because word embedding methods may not discriminate minor distinctions among tweet data or bring too much hidden information to the training process (e.g., because each word is converted into a multi-dimensional vector).\n",
            " Second, this study indicates differences between sentiment classification and opinion mining. A few studies have used sentiment analysis to assess vaccine hesitancy because sentiment could be a good indicator to reveal the overall emotions about vaccine confidence [32] . However, sentiment classification may result in a bias in opinion extraction in applications such as this study. This statement is supported by the comparatively low testing accuracy of sentiment classification compared to text classification models.\n",
            " Third, the research proposes a vaccine acceptance index based on tweeters' opinions, which is a quantitative approach to measure online opinions. While this study is presented as a COVID-19 vaccine case study, the approach is applicable to similar issues and can be generalized as a framework with medicine and health relevance. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, online opinions on wearing masks and implementation of lockdown can be investigated using a similar research framework. It can also be generalized to study the vaccine acceptance of the flu vaccine and HPV vaccine or opinions on other important healthcare events or policies.\n",
            " From a practical perspective, this study provides an approach to the rapid assessment of vaccine acceptance. At the national level, this Twitter-based index provides an instrument to track online opinions on vaccine acceptance over time. The national-level analysis also reflects that the index is subject to the dynamics of notable events and the availability of vaccine information (e.g., clinical trial results regarding vaccine safety and efficacy). At the state level, through the exploration of correlation with later vaccination rates, the study has shown the potential of social media to assess vaccine acceptance. Observations are made regarding conditions under which correlations are high. For example, data obtained after the first vaccination rollout yields higher positive correlations, and the use of a longer period of data collection (e.g., one month) for computing the VAI shows a higher correlation with later state-level vaccination rates. At the county level, since social media data may be biased towards higher population (urbanized) areas, the study explores the effect of sample size on the computed correlation between the index and county-level vaccination rates. The correlation analysis suggests that correlations stabilized when only considering counties for which data was available from at least 30 users.\n",
            " The social media approach can benefit government agencies and health officials in the following ways.\n",
            " First, the study reveals that on the use of social media data can contribute to additional insights on public reactions to governments' decisions on the vaccine. Such insights can usually be obtained via social media channels. Government agencies can also refer to social media analysis to assist decision-making related to the mechanisms for releasing information. Second, the study indicates conditions for using social media data for a granular assessment of vaccine acceptance. For example, calculating the state-level and countylevel index with data after the first vaccine distribution can generate a more reliable analysis. The countylevel assessment stabilizes when considering counties with more than 30 users. Third, this approach can help assess vaccine acceptance and help decision-makers to provide vaccine education for places where people feel hesitant to receive the vaccine.\n",
            " Biases associated with this social media approach are worthy of note. First, relying on social media data can help eliminate the bias of those choosing to participate in a survey study, but it still has the bias of those choosing to leave a public comment about the vaccine. As described in the county-level analysis, previous studies have demonstrated that social media data are likely to be biased in a more granular level estimation (e.g., social media users are younger and from more urbanized areas). These intrinsic characteristics of social media users might affect the estimates, and this limitation can be difficult to overcome in gathering social media data [59] , [60] .\n",
            " Two processes during the model development could also introduce model bias. First, this study selected the keyword \"vaccine\" to scrape tweets, mainly to ensure consistency throughout the study period. However, other keywords, such as \"vaccination\" or common vaccine-related misspellings and slang (e.g., \"vax\"), may also contain helpful information about vaccine acceptance. Second, manual classifications of tweets (including the \"ground-truth\" samples in the testing set) were based on the authors' interpretations of the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance expressed in the tweet. However, the authors might incorrectly identify a user's opinion described by a tweet.\n",
            " When this social media-based index is applied to investigate vaccine acceptance, several limitations need to be addressed. First, this study used a general list of U.S. states and cities to match users' registration locations. Given that a Twitter user's input for the registration location could differ from the tweet location, there is no guarantee that the extracted information reflects a user's actual location. Some location descriptors were not considered in our analysis. For example, a user may input the location \"Times Square,\"\n",
            " which suggests a place in New York City, but this situation is not considered in this study. Future work will consider better location descriptors and integrate them with the current pipeline to identify location (e.g., city and county).\n",
            " Although the \"simpler\" algorithm TF-IDF technique obtained reasonable accuracy in this study, it may not be suitable for situations where tweet data differ from the training tweet data, especially when the size of the training set is small. TF-IDF is a bag-of-words method that converts each word into a number (a word count with the IDF score). If the training set does not include many words that appear in the whole dataset, the TF-IDF technique may not generate a satisfactory performance. However, word embedding may also fail to generate competent performance given that it is not pre-trained based on health-related databases or cannot capture minor discriminations of words between tweets. Future work will focus on the application of neural network architectures with text vectorization techniques to improve performance, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).\n",
            " The analysis completed in this study uses English tweets and English-based NLP techniques. When the VAI is applied to estimate vaccine acceptance in non-Egnlish speaking countries, tweets written in other languages need to be collected to train the model, and correspondingly, text classification models need to be developed using NLP techniques developed in other languages. Moreover, as previously mentioned, social media data may overrepresent the young, educated, and urbanized population, so the VAI may not be suitable for applications in those areas with few people using social media to communicate. Therefore, future work will also consider using NLP and machine learning tools trained in other languages and integrating data from surveys or models (e.g., CDC HPS model [17] ) to complement the social media estimation.\n",
            " Ongoing and future work could build off the insights and approaches described in this study. For example, an extension of this study could be used to evaluate the impacts of campaigns or interventions by state or federal public and private sectors by tracking the dissemination patterns (e.g., retweets, mentions) of tweets from state-, federal-, and certain private-affiliated accounts. This can help to inform how those vaccine campaigns affect the online community. As another example, the proposed VAI can be investigated hours to days after the interventions applied to assess their real-time impacts on vaccine acceptance.\n",
            " Another extension of this study could consider integrating data from other social media plaforms and comparing the results of VAI computed based on different social media data. This can help reveal the characteristics of different social media users when focusing upon policies or events with medicine and health relevance.\n",
            " Other future work could explore the relations of the online vaccine acceptance with socioeconomic factors (e.g., education level, gender, age, employment rate) and other COVID-19 factors (e.g., death rate, hospitalization rate). This social media approach may provide valuable insights into the geographical dynamics of vaccine acceptance and aid health professionals in conducting vaccine interventions, such as vaccine education. Last, future work could consider the generalizability of this research framework by applying it to investigate the vaccine acceptance on other types of vaccine and in a broader geographical scale, such as the vaccine acceptance over HPV vaccine and flu vaccine in different countries.\n",
            " The study investigated 29 million vaccine-related tweets from August 8, 2020 to April 19, 2021, and proposes a vaccine acceptance index (VAI) to assess COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. To classify the opinions regarding vaccine acceptance, 17,000 sampled tweets were manually labeled, and different pipelines were developed with the aid of NLP techniques. Significant findings include: (1) the national VAI moved from negative to positive in 2020 and maintained constant after January 2021, consistent with survey results, (2) the East Coast of the U.S. and selected Midwest states exceeded the national index most of the time, while states in the south were lower than the national level, (3) calculating VAI over a more extended time and based on data after the first vaccine distribution generated a more reliable analysis, (4) calculating the county-level VAI when only considering counties for which data were available from at least 30 users ensured a more consistent analysis.\n",
            " These findings have demonstrated the usefulness of social media data for the dynamic assessment of vaccine acceptance and provided insights into the reliability of using social media data. This proposed social media approach provides potentials for fast and cost-effective assessment of vaccine acceptance across large geographical scales.\n",

(Ezzikouri et al., 2020) Vaccines are effective preventive strategies to prevent COVID-19. However, vaccine breakthrough and vaccine escape make it is urgent to treat COVID-19's disease. (Sun et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021) There are few approved effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2. (Esparza et al., 2020) The treatment of SARS-COV-2 still has many problems to solve. (Valenzuela Nieto et al., 2021) Low-cost treatments have important implications for the COVID-19 pandemic. (Ye et al., 2020) At the same time, SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibody is very important as a COVID-19 drug. (Pymm et al., 2021) The pandemic of COVID-19 highlights the serious consequences of animal virus leakage on public health, economy and society. (Olival et al., 2020) A worrying problem is that SARS-COV-2 may spread to local wild species, which may make the virus popular by setting up a second host. (Franklin and Bevins, 2020) The widespread of SARS-COV-2 in human beings increases the theoretical risk of reversal of zoonotic events in wild animals, that is, SARS-CoV-2 is introduced into animals that are not allowed to be domesticated.

            " As we pen down this sentence, cases of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) are continuously increasing across the globe. In accordance to 26 th July 2020 as per WHO (World Health Organization) situation report No. 187 and Centre for System Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, globally greater than 15.9 million cases have been stated, resulting in 643,000 deaths, 9.22 million recovered cases with United States reporting the highest number of cases around 4.17 million (World Health Organization (WHO), 2020) (Johns Hopkins CSSE, 2020) . Speaking for India as per Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, till 26 th July 2020 there are 1,385,522 confirmed cases, and 467,882 active cases, among which 32,063 deaths and 885,576 recovered cases have been reported (Policy j Ministry of Health and Family Welfare j GOI, Policy j Ministry of Health and Family Welfare j GOI, 2020Policy j Policy j Ministry of Health & Family Welfare j GOI, 2020Welfare j GOI, 2020). Coronaviruses (CoV) is the beta strain from the family Coronaviridae which leads to maladies of the vital organs like respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological systems if not treated (Chan et al., 2012; Zumla et al., 2016) . It is a single stranded RNA virus (positive sense) having diameter of 80-120 nm, among which recently SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) has arose as a universal contagion infecting humans with 3-4% mortality rate (Zhu et al., 2020) . Owing to zoonotic origins and genetic similarity, bats are pondered as the natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 . It consists of four structural proteins namely Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocaspid (N) which helps coronavirus in recognizing the receptor on the target cell, fusion with membrane receptor causing infection and further transmission within the host. As compared to SARS-CoV, novel SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2) host surface protein with affinity far greater than threshold requisite for virus infectivity, but the pathological effects of SARS-CoV-2 for causing organ damage remained to be elucidated . This binding factor is the major reason for swift transmission potentiality of the SARS-CoV-2 as compared to SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2020) . The first line of action is to hinder the latching of virus towards the host ACE-2 receptors by blocking the function of Spike proteins, which would help to trim down the figure of new cases. But in already infected case to provide remedy, target for main proteases (M pro ) are being searched out as it translates the viral RNA into functional polyproteins that alters the normal physiology of the subject by formation of viral RNA polymerase, endoribonuclease and exoribonuclease Elmezayen et al., 2020) . M pro , also called 3CL pro (3C-like protease or chymotrypsin-like protease) is a dimer owning six stranded antiparallel b barrels, holding substrate binding site in the middle of them, along with cluster of five helices which are responsible for dimerization of the enzyme. The majority of the Coronaviridae genome encodes two polyproteins, pp1a (Wrapp et al., 2020) and pp1ab (Mengist et al., 2020; Mittal et al., 2020) . With the help of two proteases 3CL pro (3-chemotrypsin-like protease) and PL pro (papain-like protease) encoded by the open reading frame, the above mentioned polyproteins are cleaved and further transformed in mature non-structural proteins (NSPs). In addition to papain-like protease(s) M pro is required for dispensing polyproteins at 11 different sites to produce proteins which are translated from the viral RNA. Restraining the pursuit of M pro would impede viral replication process inside the host (Anand et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2020) . Since no other human protease are known with similar cleavage specificity at sites of Leu-Gln#(Ser, Ala, Gly) is known till date, the inhibitors of these targets are likely to be non-toxic. Amongst the prospective protease inhibitors, the antivirals Nelfinavir, Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir along with a-ketoamide are peculiarly striking as therapeutics to battle the new coronavirus (De Oliveira et al., 2020; Mothay & Ramesh, 2020). Apart from these, combination of anti-viral such as Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Favipiravir , anti-malarial, namely Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine (Muralidharan et al., 2020) and corticosteroid like Dexamethasone (World Health Organization, 2020) therapy are being used for controlling COVID-19. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 M pro have recently emerged as the better targets in inhibiting virus replication. The present study fascinated on the main proteases of SARS-CoV-2 as potential macromolecular target for COVID-19 management using active phytoconstituents mentioned in Ayurvedic scriptures.\n",
            " Ayurveda knows as 'The Science of Life', an ancient system of medicine practiced in Indian subcontinent; based on the holistic principle of life, health, and healing system. A group of rejuvenative methods that imparts biological nourishment to the body tissues was described in Ayurvedic text (Singh et al., 2008) . It describe many medicinal plants with wide range of therapeutic potentiality in treating the ailment of respiratory system; some of the notable ones but not limited to are Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy), Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi) used in present study. They are all immunomodulators and strengthen the body against infections. W. somnifera (WS), usually known as Ashwagandha, categorized as a rasayana (rejuvenator) which was predicted to enrich physical and mental state, considered to rejuvenate the body in weakened situations and upturns longevity (Williamson, 2002) . It has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, antimicrobial, analgesic, anti-tumour, anti-stress, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, rejuvenating and immunomodulatory effects (Kapoor, 1990; Ven Murthy et al., 2010; Vyas et al., 2011; Williamson, 2002) . An active ingredient known as 'withanolides' contains steroidal saponin, alkaloids, and steroidal lactones. Most of biological action contributed by Withaferin-A and Withanolide D, along with Withanoside I-VII, new Withanolide Glycosides, extracted from its roots (Matsuda et al., 2001) . T. cordifolia (Guduchi or Giloy), is a medicinal plant which has been used for its remedial purpose for thousands of year in Ayurvedic system of medicine. Its extracts have alkaloids, glycosides, steroids and polysaccharides (Panchabhai et al., 2008) . It is well known for its immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antihepatotoxic and cytotoxic effects (Sharma et al., 2012; Thatte et al., 1992) . The active phytoconstituents, Tinocordioside, Cordifolioside A, Magnoflorine, and Syringin are known for its immunomodulatory effect (Sharma et al., 2011) . O. sanctum (Tulsi), as a sanctified herb used for its medicinal property as per Ayurvedic scriptures. It's multiple therapeutic action comprises of adaptogenic, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects (Jamshidi & Cohen, 2017) , anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity (S. Sharma, 1999) , also possess anti-diabetic, analgesic, antifertility, anticancer, antispasmodic, antiemetic, diaphoretic and hepatoprotective actions (Prakash & Gupta, 2005) . Their leaves are beneficial for the treatment of rheumatism, bronchitis, and pyrexia and considered as 'Elixir of life' for its healing power (Nadkarni & Krishnarao, 1954) . By the enhancement of both cellular and humoral immunity, it strengthens the immune response (Mukherjee et al., 2005) .\n",

It has been reported that Dihydrodieuginol B and Tulsinol A, B, C, D, E, F, G of O. sanctum could be used as potential inhibitors for Papain-like Protease and SARS Coronavirus Main Protease and Withanone from W. somnifera could be used to disrupt interconnections between Viral S-Protein RBD (receptor binding domain) and ACE2 host receptor of COVID-19 (Balkrishna et al., 2020) . With majority of world beneath lockdown and the alarming menace of millions of deaths, researchers requisite to find an effective drug more rapidly. Since SARS-CoV-2, is a new virus, more studies are required for searching the drugs to target viral systems without much side-effect to the human populations; here Ayurvedic formulations can play a significant role, for developing therapeutic moieties that would be safe and nontoxic. In this research article, with the use of in silico molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies, an attempt was made to identify new active and stable inhibitors against novel coronavirus main protease, from total 102 different active phytoconstituents from above stated medicinal plants. Thereby hindering the viral translation into functional polyproteins required for further replication of virus and disruption of host physiological/ biological functions.\n",

            " Potential inhibitors from W. somnifera (Ashwagandha) for SARS-CoV-2 M pro From molecular docking study it has been found that out of 28 compounds from W. somnifera (Ashwagandha) only two compounds namely Withanoside V (CID_10700345) and Somniferine (CID_14106343) showed significant binding affinity as compared to native N3 (CID_146025593) for SARS-CoV-2 M pro as per YASARA scoring. Withanoside V showed highest binding energy of 10.32 kcal/mol. Withanoside V is a glycoside obtained from W. somnifera roots, reported to have tachyphylaxis inhibition activity (Matsuda et al., 2001) . It forms different ligand-protein 2D-3D interactions which includes conventional and carbon hydrogen bonding with residue Asn 84, Arg 40 and Met 82, alkyl and p-alkyl interaction with Cys 85, Arg 105 and Phe 134. Numerous van der Waals interactions were also formed by remaining residues (Figure 1(a,b) ). Somniferine was found to be another inhibitor with binding energy 9.62 kcal/mol.

Tinocordiside have binding energy of 8.10 kcal/mol. Tinocordiside is found to be a new reorganized cadinane sesquiterpene glycoside from T. cordifolia (Giloy) (Ghosal & Vishwakarma, 1997) . Different 2D-3D interactions formed by Tinocordiside includes conventional and carbon hydrogen bonding with the residues Gly 143, Leu 141 and Met 165, alkyl and p-alkyl interaction were formed with Cys 145, His 41 and Leu 27. Many van der Waals interactions were formed by remaining residues (Figure 2(a,b) ).\n",
            " Out of 46 active phytochemicals from O. sanctum (Tulsi), only three compounds namely Vicenin (CID_3084407), Isorientin Ursolic acid (CID_64945) showed significant binding affinity as compared to built-in ligand N3 for SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Vicenin was found to have highest binding energy of 8.97 kcal/mol. Vicenin formed many 2D-3D interactions with the receptor protein which includes conventional, carbon and p-donor hydrogen bonding with the residues Glu 166, Thr 190, Gln 189 and Pro 168, a p-sulfur bonding with Met 165, a alkyl interaction was formed with Cys 145 and various van der Waals interactions were found to be formed by remaining residues (Figure 3(a,b) ). Second inhibitor was found to be Isorientin 4 0 -O-glucoside 2 00 -O-p-hydroxybenzoagte with binding energy 8.55 kcal/mol. It forms different 2D-3D interactions which includes positive charged hydrogen bonding with the residues Arg 40, Arg 105, Arg 188 and hydrophobic interaction with the residue Tyr 54 (Figure 4(a,b) ). Another inhibitor was found to be Ursolic acid with binding energy 8.52 kcal/mol. Ursolic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, reported to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antimicrobial, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-ulcer, hepatoprotective, anti-fungal and antimalarial activities (Prakash & Gupta, 2005 ; RJPP -Traditional Indian Herbal Plants Tulsi & Its Medicinal Importance & , 2010). It forms conventional and carbon hydrogen bonding with the residue Leu 271, alkyl and p-alkyl interaction with the residues Leu 272, Leu 287 and Tyr 239. It also formed several van der Waals interactions with the remaining residues (Figure 3(c,d) ). From molecular docking study, as per YASARA scoring, it had been clear that Withanoside V, Somniferine, Tinocordiside, Vicenin, Isorientin 4 0 -O-glucoside 2 00 -O-phydroxybenzoagte and Ursolic acid from W. somnifera (Ashwagandha), T. cordifolia (Giloy), and O. sanctum (Tulsi) predicted to acts as probable inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Structures of best docked compounds are shown in Figure 5 . Ursolic acid (CID_64945) was simulated for understanding the structural deviations in the dynamic environment for the timescale of 20 ns. Each complex deviation was recorded for RMSD from its initial position and the values were calculated and plotted simultaneously ( Figure 6 ). While observing the results, it has been found that, RMSD for the compounds shows uniqueness in the dynamic conditions. For the initial 8 ns, except the compound CID_177384 and CID_3084407, all the other compounds showed lower and stable deviations $1 to $2.5 Å. The compounds CID_177384 and CID_3084407 showed deviations up to $3Å, especially from 2 to 4 ns of the MD simulations. After 8 ns, there was visible movement in the upward direction however the stable movement was initiated between $ 1.5 and $3.5 Å. One of the notable compound, CID_64945 with two hydrogen bond donor and three hydrogen bond acceptor adopts well inside the binding pocket in the docking calculations, and the interactions were stable in the MD simulations. But compound shows much activity with the binding of loop structures in M pro binding site, and thus the deviations for the CID_64945 was seen from $3Å to $4Å in between the timescale of 10 to 20 ns of the MD simulations. Another compound CID_177384 (2-(Diethylamino)ethyl tetrahydro-alpha-(1-naphthylmethyl)-2-furanpropionate), holding three oxygen atom along with one nitrogen atom holds the active site binding, but the deviation drift occurs in 18 ns, due to the breaking of hydrogen bonds from the amino acids residues Arg 188 and Gln 189. Interestingly, in showing tight binding in the M pro peptide binding pocket. Even though the compound showed large allocation towards the binding pocket, we did not notice any unbounding in the 20 ns of the MD simulations. The compound Vicenin (CID_3084407) showed similar binding mode of CID_177384, but the drift was seen from 15 to 20 ns, due to strong bond formation with the interactions of residues Glu 166 and Asn 142. The overall RMSD of all the compounds for the timescale of 20 ns is provided in Figure 6 .\n",
            " For cognizance the reason of RMSD deviations, we have accounted hydrogen bonds between the protein-ligand complexes (Figure 7) . While observing the hydrogen bonds, it has been found that there was a strong correlation between hydrogen bonds and RMSD analysis. It has been noticed that the resemblance of hydrogen bonds getting down after 8 ns, and this had impacted the upwards movement of RMSD from the 9 to 20 ns. In order to understand the contributing amino acids residues, the MD trajectories were carefully analysed. The ligand molecule CID_44257986 showed 8-12 contacts till 10 ns, only after the hydrogen bonds are levelled between 6 and 8 hydrogen bonds. This impact was revealed in the RMSD values, but interestingly one of the amino acid residue Glu 166 was playing vital role in holding the CID_44257986 throughout the MD simulations. The CID_10700345 interaction with M pro , during the MD simulations, resulted in high residual fluctuations between the regions of 130-190th position. Here also, the amino acid residue Glu 166 was playing vital role in holding the CID_10700345, even though high deviations were seen in residual amino acid positions. The oxygen atom in the ligand CID_10700345 showed 83% of interactions with residue Glu 166 in the MD simulations, which showed significant contribution of Glu 166 in the binding. For the compound CID_3084407, hydrogen bond does not have stability except the Glu 166, but the single amino acid residue pattern holds the CID_3084407 throughout the MD simulations. In this, the other amino acid residue Gln 192, was contributing to hold Gln 166 which form hydrogen bonds with the OH atom of the ligand. The other compound CID_177384 showed tight bound in the binding pocket, but unexpectedly, we did not find a single amino acid residue that holds the ligand throughout 20 ns of the MD simulations. The amino acids residues like Asn 142, Glu 166, Arg 188, Gln 189, Gln 192 were contributing in different intervals for holding the CID_177384 inside the binding pocket. For the compound CID_14106343, the residual movements were not observed high, due to the formation of hydrophobic interactions. Especially the amino acid residues His 41, Met 49 and Met 165 were contributing in hydrophobic interactions with ligand and thus, the ligand is tightly bound inside the binding pocket. For the compound CID_14106343, the key amino \n",
            " Drug-likeness test for the best docked compounds was predicted with the help of Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET molecular property prediction test was performed out by admetSAR server. Lipinski rule of five is a thumb rule of five which aids in differentiating among drug like and non-drug like molecules by obeying its five parameters (Molecular mass, Hydrogen bond donor, Hydrogen bond acceptor, Log P and Molar refractivity); it must obey 2 or more of their parameters. Consequently best docked compounds Withanoside V, Somniferine, Tinocordiside and Vicenin, Isorientin 4 0 -O-glucoside 2 00 -O-p-hydroxybenzoagte and Ursolic acid from present study follows more than two parameters of Lipinski rule of five and hence deliberated as drug-like compounds. Additionally, best docked compounds were found to be within the standard scale considering their water solubility (LogS), human intestinal absorption (HIA), Caco-2 permeability and have no carcinogenic effects (Table 2) .\n",
            " Currently in modern medicine, both individual and combination of anti-malarial, anti-viral and corticosteroid therapy are being used for treating COVID-19. Recently as per WHO Dexamethasone (World Health Organization, 2020) has shown promising results, India based Glen mark has introduced antiviral drug Favipiravir (Glenmark launches Covid-19 drug at Rs 103 per tablet -India news -Hindustan Times, 2020) which has got regulatory approval for Phase III assessment for treating mild to moderate COVID-19 patient. Repurposing of drug for treating COVID-19 is being extensively used for managing the current cases of COVID-19. Natural product with medicinal property can be used, as toxicity profile is less in comparison to synthetic compounds. Consulting Ayurveda for treating COVID-19 provides reliable evidence-based medicinal plants for managing the ailment of respiratory disorders. In silico approach such as molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies provides fundamental starting point in terms of binding energy and stability of ligands with proteins for further research. SARS-CoV-2 M pro is important in stimulating proteolytic maturation of viral RNA into functional proteins namely RNA polymerase, endoribonuclease and exoribonuclease which also hampers the intrinsic immune system of the host. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 M pro can be deliberated as significant target as it helps in translation of polyproteins into individual functional component that subsequently forms 16 NSPs which helps in viral transcription and replication (Jo et al., 2020) .\n",
            " Present work describes the role of active phytoconstituents from Ayurvedic medicinal plants W. somnifera (Ashwagandha), T. cordifolia (Giloy), and O. sanctum (Tulsi) for treating COVID 19 pandemic. As stated earlier in this article, from various studies (Balkrishna et al., 2020; Dharmendra & Deepak, 2020; Varshney et al., 2020) some of the phytoconstituents from these medicinal plants have shown promising effect against COVID-19 targets. Present work reports phytochemicals which are different from previous studies for inhibition of M pro with significant binding affinity as per YASARA scoring. Six phytochemicals from present study namely Withanoside V, Somniferine, Tinocordiside, Vicenin, Isorientin 4 0 -O-glucoside 2 00 -O-p-hydroxybenzoagte and Ursolic acid obtained from medicinal plants, have predicted significant binding energy as compared to the native ligand N3 (Figures 1-4 , Table 1 ). The binding of these identified active phytochemicals with M pro decreases the process of viral transcription and replication by down turning the cleavage of poly proteins that release NSPs. From present work, it has been suggested that the best docked compounds obtained from Ayurvedic medicinal plants W. somnifera (Ashwagandha), T. cordifolia (Giloy) and O. sanctum (Tulsi) could be predicted to serve as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M pro , with their significant binding affinity, stable MD runs, ADMET prediction and drug-likeness properties. These phytoconstituents not only impede the interaction of viral protein to the host cell to transmit and propagate inside the human body but they are also safe to repurpose against COVID-19 without any toxicity.\n",
            " COVID-19 is an evolving disease triggered by COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and has turned into a global pandemic in the blink of eyes. SARS-CoV-2 M pro is shown to be highly potent and vital target for the inhibition of COVID-19 contamination. In present study, molecular docking analysis identified six phytochemicals (Withanoside V [10.32 kcal/mol], Somniferine [9.62 kcal/mol], Tinocordiside [8.10 kcal/mol], Vicenin [8.97 kcal/mol], Isorientin 4 0 -O-glucoside 2 00 -O-phydroxybenzoagte [8.55 kcal/mol] and Ursolic acid [8.52 kcal/ mol]) from medicinal plants with potential inhibition and high affinities towards SARS-CoV-2 M pro , predicted to restrain the action of SARS-CoV-2 M pro thereby obstructing further translation of viral protein that assists in damaging the vital organs of the host. These phytochemicals might be repurposed against COVID-19. The best docked compounds with drug-like property have harmless ADMET profile which may help in developing optimised potent COVID-19 inhibitors. During MD runs, the trajectories analysis of the studied complexes displayed structural stability. From this study, we may conclude that above stated active phytochemicals, predicted to have the potential to be repurposed as anti-COVID-19 Ayurvedic therapeutics.\n",

            " The existing strategies across the nations are reutilization of medicine for effective treatment and management of COVID-19. Here, natural products play a pivotal role for repurposing against this pandemic as it offers minimal and in some cases no toxicity. As the clock is ticking and earth is under lockdown, in silico studies and virtual analysis may provide evidence based management of COVID-19. It is supported by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation analysis of the above mentioned active phytoconstituents against the most utilized macromolecular target of SARS-CoV-2, i.e. main protease (M pro ) which is found to be responsible for growth of virus via proteolytic cleavage, further acting as a transit point for virus entry and replication. Targeting main protease with natural phytoconstituents would serve as checkpoint for viral entry, thereby will resist their further replication and propagation. We hope with this study one could utilize the holistic approach of Ayurvedic medicinal plant to avenge against the grimmest disease of this modern day era.\n",

            " Globally, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to more than 233 million infections and more than 4.7 million deaths according to the statistics of World Health Organization (WHO) as of October 1, 2021 [Ren and et al., 2021] . The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is broad: Many COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms; however, some patients progress to severe life-threatening conditions [Ren and et al., 2021] . Accurate classification of COVID-19 severity in patients may aid in delivering proper healthcare and reducing mortality. Thus it is of great importance to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease and identify the biomarkers of the illness severity accurately [de Terwangne et al., 2020] .\n",
            " Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool at dissecting the cellular processes and characterizing immune responses [Ren and et al., 2021, Niyakan et al., 2021] . Many groups have been applying scRNA-seq to COVID-19 studies to better understand the human immune response to the infection [Ren and et al., 2021 , Wauters et al., 2021 , Cao et al., 2020 . A recent study performed scRNA-seq on Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of patients with different COVID-19 severity levels to characterize the respiratory immune properties associated with COVID-19 severity [Liao et al., 2020] .\n",
            " To help better understand the inherent biological signals in the recently published single-cell RNA-seq data from BALF cells [Liao et al., 2020] for COVID-19 severity prediction, we develop a bioinformatics pipeline to first identify the COVID-19 severity biomarker genes and then classify BALF cells using these genes. We apply several classification algorithms, including linear classifiers, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and non-linear ones, such as Quadratic and Flexible Discriminant Analysis (QDA and FDA [Hastie et al., 1994] ), Random Forests (RF) [Breiman, 2001] and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate our pipeline in classifying BALF cells based on COVID-19 severity. \n",
            " We have used the scBALF-COVID-19 dataset prepared for the single-cell transcriptomics challenge of the IEEE COVID-19 Data Hackathon. This dataset is derived from public data [Liao et al., 2020] and contains a set of Broncho Alveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) cells from patients categorized clinically as having mild, severe or no COVID-19 infection. In detail, the dataset has scRNA-seq data of 23189 BALF cells from three classes based on COVID-19 severity: mild infection (3292 cells), severe infection (7919 cells), and no infection (11978 cells) across 1999 genes. The dataset has been normalized for technical differences between patients (batch normalization) as well as sequencing depth differences between cells in each patient. This normalization step, has removed the overdispersion inherent in typical scRNA-seq data. As a result, it may not be beneficial to apply typical scRNA-seq tools for biomarker identification and cell clustering on this normalized data set, such as scVI [Lopez et al., 2018] , DESeq2 [Love et al., 2014] and SimCD [Niyakan et al., 2021] , in which Negative Binomial (NB) distribution models and their extensions were developed to model scRNA-seq data. As shown in the histogram plot of normalized gene expression values for a random gene \"CXCR1\" in the left plot of Fig 1, normalized gene expression profiles across samples can be approximated with a normal distribution.\n",
            " At the first step of our proposed pipeline, we detect genes that are differentially expressed (DE) across cells with different levels of COVID-19 severity. In order to do this we perform three different sets of DE analyses, each time as one label vs the rest (e.g. severe cells vs other cells). DE analyses are based on the R package Monocle [Qiu et al., 2017] designed specifically for scRNA-seq experiments with the capability of handling normally distributed data. This can be done by passing the argument expressionFamily to be uninormal. In detail, what Monocle does for DE analyses is fitting vector generalized linear models (VGLM) to both full and reduced models and then computing likelihood ratio Chi-squared statistics and corresponding p-values. After that, for each of three analyses, we rank genes based on their adjusted p-values in an increasing order. Then we report the intersection of top 100 DE genes (also having lower adjusted p-values) in all three DE analyses as COVID-19 severity potential biomarkers.\n",
            " After identifying the candidate genes as biomarkers to classify BALF cells for COVID-19 infection severity, we run various well-known classifiers, including both linear and non-linear classifiers. We first run LDA as it assumes that predictors are normally distributed and that the different classes have class-specific means and equal variance. Then we try multiple non-linear classifiers, including QDA, FDA, RF and SVM with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel to better capture the non-linearity in the data. For LDA and QDA, we use lda and qda from the R package MASS. For FDA, we use fda with the regression method to be multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), from R package mda. For RF, we use randomForest function from a R package with the same name. We perform SVM with RBF, with the svm from the R package e1071. Also, it worth mentioning that in order to account for the imbalance in class labels we set the option class.weights to be inverse so that weights for samples with different class labels be chosen inversely proportional to the corresponding class size.\n",
            " In this section, we present the results of applying our bioinformatics pipeline discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 to the BALF cell scRNA-seq data. First, we discuss the biomarker identification results and then go over the results of cell classification tools.\n",
            " After applying the DE analyses detailed in Section 2.2, we end up having 12 genes in the intersection set of top 100 DE genes in three sets of DE analyses performed by Monocle: RSAD2, CXCL10, IDO1, GCH1, CXCL11, CRYBA4, CCL3, LGMN, IFIT1, CTSB, GBP1 and CCL2. Half of these genes (RSAD2, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL3, IFIT1, CCL2) have been previously reported as genetic biomarkers for COVID-19 severity in a recent study that profiled the immune response signatures in the BALF cells of eight COVID-19 cases [Zhou et al., 2020] . The rest of the genes detected by our pipeline can be new potential biomarkers for immune response to COVID-19 in BALF cells. The middel and right box plots in Fig. 1 show the normalized gene expression values of GBP1 and RSAD2, two identified potential biomarkers by our pipeline. RSAD2 has been previously studied to be associated with respiratory immune response severity in BALF cells but GBP1 can be a new potential biomarker.\n",
            " After having the ranking lists of genes based on their adjusted p-values in three sets of one class vs rest DE analyses, we make three different sets of candidate gene features for cell classification: Applying these to our BALF scRNA-seq data, we find 12, 88 and 194 genes in the gene sets G1, G2 and G3 respectively. Venn diagram of top 100 DE genes from the three sets of DE analyzes is shown in left plot of Figure 2 . We then apply the previously described classification algorithms in Section 2.3 with the gene expression values from each of the gene sets to classify cells. In order to measure the accuracy of each classifier by each of three gene sets, we first randomly split data to 75% and 25% of the total size of the available cell samples to construct training and test sample sets. Then for each gene set and each classifier, we train the classifier three times (each time one label vs the rest) on the training set and calculate area under Receiver Operator Characteristic (AUC-ROC) values by testing the trained model on the test data. In each case of label comparison, classification algorithm and gene set, we run the code three times and then report the average and standard deviations of AUC-ROC values. Table 1 shows these AUC-ROC values for each of combinations of running one of five different classifiers on three gene sets. As it was expected, the linear classifier LDA has the worst performance in comparison with non-linear ones. Furthermore, as we expect, almost for all classifiers the AUC-ROC is higher when using the gene set G3 comparing to other two gene sets G1 and G2. Similar trends when comparing the results using G2 vs G1. This is reasonable as Table.1) the numbers of genes (biomarkers/features) in the gene sets G2 and G3 are 7 and 16 times higher than the number of genes in the gene set G1, respectively. Actually, the performance of RF, SVM with the RBF kernel, and FDA on the gene set G1, which only has 12 genes, show the practicality of our proposed biomarker identification approach to detect COVID-19 severity in BALF cells. Table 1 , also presents the superior performance of the random forest classification algorithm on dissecting BALF cells based on their COVID-19 severity. Also, it worth mentioning that one can almost accurately classify BALF cells, by running the RF algorithm on the proposed set of genes from the biomarker identification step in our bioinformatics pipeline.\n",
            " Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 infection across the world and daily increasing number of mortality in the patients having the infection, it is of great importance to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms in human immune response to this infection. As a result of this, here, we presented a bioinformatics pipeline, capable of first, identifying potential COVID-19 severity biomarkers in BALF cells and secondly, accurately classifying cells based on the constructed set of genes. The proposed pipeline is implemented in R and all the codes are available in the Github page: https://github.com/namini94/scBALF_Hackathon.\n",

            " Recibido el 15 de diciembre de 2021; aceptado el 22 de diciembre de 2021\n",
            " El mundo actual se está enfrentando a una de las mayores amenazas de los últimos años. La pandemia por Covid-19 ha afectado a todos los ámbitos de la vida; social, político, económico y especialmente en materia de salud, donde ha supuesto una gran crisis a nivel mundial que ha provocado situaciones de colapso de los sistemas sanitarios.\n",
            " Toda la población, sin distinción, se ha visto afectada por la pandemia. Pero los profesionales de la salud han tenido que enfrentarse a su cara más negativa: la muerte, la soledad, el miedo, el riesgo de contagio y la sobrecarga de trabajo. Sobrellevar el día a día de la actividad asistencial en hospitales, centros socio-sanitarios o atención primaria, ha sido difícil y el impacto producido, enorme. A finales de 2020 el Consejo Internacional de Enfermeras, en una estimación que consideraba ''a la baja'', ''ya que contemplaba únicamente datos de 44 de los 195 países que existen, anunciaba que ya habían fallecido en el mundo por Covid-19 tantas enfermeras como en la Primera Guerra Mundial'', donde fallecieron 1.500 enfermeras 1 . Más allá de los fallecimientos, el impacto se refleja también en los problemas de salud mental derivados de la pandemia, fruto de las experiencias y condiciones laborales adversas que las enfermeras han afrontado desde marzo de 2020, impacto que en nuestro país se estima afecta al 80% de las enfermeras 2 .\n",
            " A pesar de todo, durante estos meses, las enfermeras han sabido estar ahí, siempre presentes, en primera línea, gracias a su capacidad de resiliencia, que les ha permitido superar las adversidades, aprender de ellas y adquirir la fortaleza necesaria para continuar, porque era necesario hacerlo. Y así lo han hecho, desempeñando un papel excepcional durante toda la pandemia, demostrando su capacidad de adaptación a esta nueva situación, ejerciendo como verdadero motor de cambio, planificando y liderando las continuas modificaciones organizativas que imponía el Covid-19 3 .\n",
            " Durante este tiempo las enfermeras han recuperado su visibilidad, tanto en el exterior como en el interior de las propias instituciones sanitarias. La población ha sido testigo de la actividad desarrollada por las enfermeras y el lugar que ocupa en los diferentes ámbitos de trabajo. Sin embargo, todavía queda mucho por avanzar en reconocimiento y visibilidad de las enfermeras. Un análisis de las fuentes y temas sanitarios en los informativos de Radiotelevisión Española (RTVE) emitidos entre el 31 diciembre 2019 y el 8 junio 2020 revela la falta de visibilidad de los profesionales de salud en la cobertura informativa televisiva en España sobre el Covid-19, siendo la prioridad temas de política y de los propios políticos 4 .\n",
            " Pero una vez que lo peor ha pasado, llega el momento de echar la vista atrás, de reflexionar y sobre todo, de espehttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2021.12.003 1130-8621/© 2021 El Autor(s). Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U. Este es un artículo Open Access bajo la licencia CC BY-NC-ND (http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). rar una respuesta a la pregunta ¿y ahora qué?. Hoy más que nunca vemos las carencias de nuestro sistema, las cuales se han hecho más evidentes durante este periodo de crisis sanitaria. La pandemia ha puesto de relevancia sistemas sanitarios que explotan el trabajo físico y emocional de sus enfermeras, sin darse cuenta que las enfermeras no son un recurso inagotable 5 . Desde hace muchos años la ratio de enfermeras por habitante en España está lejos del de otros países europeos, lo que se traduce en una importante sobrecarga de trabajo. Las enfermeras de los hospitales españoles tienen a su cargo el mayor número de pacientes en comparación al resto de países europeos, oscilando entre 9,5 y 17,9 pacientes por enfermera 6 . Ya en 2013, en el último gran estudio realizado en 60 hospitales del Sistema Nacional de Salud, la cuarta parte de las enfermeras afirmaban que, si pudieran, dejarían su trabajo en el hospital en el próximo año 7 .\n",
            " A esto se suma un sistema de contratación que no responde a la experiencia y especialidad de las enfermeras, con rotaciones demasiado frecuentes de puesto de trabajo y con escasa continuidad a pesar del nivel de desempeño. Sin mencionar el trato (o mejor dicho, el ''mal trato'') dado en muchas comunidades autónomas a las enfermeras que han estado en primera línea con los denominados ''contratos covid''. El sistema en general y los que lo gobiernan, en particular, con los actuales criterios de gestión de recursos humanos, parecen vivir de espaldas a la evidencia que pone de manifiesto que el coste asociado a la rotación de una enfermera ronda los 80 mil euros, en concepto de costes ligados a la contratación de una nueva enfermera y la pérdida de productividad, tanto de la nueva enfermera, como de las compañeras, que deben asumir la tutorización y las funciones de ésta hasta que alcance el nivel de especialidad que tenía la anterior 8 .\n",
            " Las enfermeras piden ahora que alguien cuide de ellas para que puedan continuar cuidando. Es fundamental que nuestro sistema sanitario alcance las cifras de enfermeras de otros países europeos, para lo cual debería contratar miles de ellas, pero también es fundamental que las condiciones de trabajo mejoren. En un estudio realizado por Aiken 9 se evidencia que si el entorno de trabajo es malo, por mucho que se incremente el número de enfermeras, los resultados en los pacientes no mejoran. Sin embargo, en entornos de trabajo saludables, la mejora de la ratio de enfermeras tiene como consecuencia una disminución clara de la mortalidad de los pacientes. Y somos conscientes de que una parte de la mejora del entorno de trabajo es consecuencia de la mejora de la ratio, pero solo una parte. Además, un buen entorno de trabajo es aquel en el que la enfermera tiene autonomía, existe liderazgo enfermero, colaboración interprofesional e interés por una mejora de la calidad de cuidados. A este respecto, entre 15 países europeos, España era el tercer país con peor valoración de la calidad de cuidados por parte de sus enfermeras 10 .\n",
            " Sin ninguna duda, la mejora de la ratio de enfermeras y la consecuente mejora en la calidad de cuidados, es una de las medidas prioritarias para mejorar las condiciones de trabajo de las enfermeras 11 . Pero la evidencia también apunta hacia un apoyo y motivación por parte de las gestoras y la presencia de una figura de supervisión y apoyo clínico 11 . La necesidad de las enfermeras gestoras de contar con nuevos perfiles enfermeros que les ayuden a formar a su personal en calidad de cuidados ha sido abordada por sistemas sanitarios de otros países con ayuda de la enfermera de práctica avanzada 12 . Estas figuras tienen el potencial de producir cambios organizativos que contribuyan a la mejora del cuidado, fomentando la implementación de la evidencia en la práctica y ejerciendo de mentoras y formadoras para otras enfermeras y profesionales de la salud 13 .\n",
            " La pandemia ha revelado la necesidad de proteger a los profesionales de la salud, y en especial, a las enfermeras. Son necesarias medidas políticas y económicas que permitan mejorar las condiciones de trabajo de este colectivo y potenciar su figura 14 dentro y fuera de las organizaciones sanitarias. Avances que redundarán en una mejora de la calidad de los cuidados y, en definitiva, de los resultados de salud de la población.\n",
            " En conclusión, que la pandemia no empañe un 2020 declarado como el Año de la Enfermería y la Matrona por la OMS, y que se convierta en un hito histórico en el empoderamiento de las enfermeras y su cuidado. Ahora es el momento de que se realicen las acciones políticas y los cambios estructurales necesarios y se siga trabajando para visibilizar a las enfermeras y conseguir su merecido reconocimiento profesional y social.\n",

Currently, 10-15% of those affected develop severe disease, and worldwide mortality is around 6%. 1 Transmission of the causal virus -severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -is primarily by contact with droplets, fomites and to a lesser degree, aerosol generation. 2 For health care workers, aerosol generation during airway management is a significant concern. In cardiothoracic surgery there are particular procedures that are high risk for aerosol generation and hence transmission of COVID-19. In order to protect staff, it is important to minimise these procedures if possible, or ensure that they are conducted in a suitable environment with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). While screening tools are available to assess the risk of a patient contracting COVID-19, transmission can occur from asymptomatic patients, albeit at low risk. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons has published guidelines for the management of surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. 3 Here, we discuss issues specific to cardiothoracic surgery; key recommendations are summarised in Box 1.\n",
            " Group committee on 12 April 2020 revealed wide variability in the management of cardiothoracic surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following discussions with the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons committee, it was felt that despite recommendations in airway management and ventilation, there was limited information and guidance for the management of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery and the potential for prolonged and ongoing exposure during these procedures. A need for guidance in this subspecialty group during the pandemic was identified.\n",
            " A panel of six experts (three cardiothoracic anaesthetists and three cardiothoracic surgeons) was assembled from different states and hospitals across Australia to review national guidance, consensus recommendations and current literature on aerosol generation relevant to cardiothoracic surgery and the management of patients during the COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks.\n",
            " Articles reviewed were of low or very low quality evidence according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, consisting mainly of observational data and expert opinion. Our recommendations were based on the principles outlined in these publications combined with expert opinion and experience in the subspecialty of cardiothoracic surgery.\n",
            " Our recommendations were then referred to the Anaesthetic Continuing Education Cardiac Thoracic Vascular and Perfusion Special Interest Group and Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons executive committees, comprising cardiothoracic anaesthetists and surgeons from across Australia and New Zealand, for review and comment. The final consensus statement has been endorsed by these bodies. We acknowledge that as evidence and knowledge regarding COVID-19 continues to evolve, guidance may change.\n",
            " Guidelines regarding PPE have been produced by individual state government health authorities (eg, the New South Wales Clinical Excellence Commission and the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services) in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 4, 5 PPE type is classified as standard, contact, droplet or airborne precautions. Formal training is essential and donning and doffing procedures should be strictly followed. N95 and P2 masks should be fit tested and fit checked each time they are applied. 6 The most effective protection is frequent and effective hand hygiene. 7\n",
            " Risk stratification is paramount in patients presenting for cardiothoracic surgery. The definitions for confirmed, probable and suspected cases can be found in the Communicable Diseases Network Australia national guidelines. 8 High risk patients include:\n",
            " • patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection; • symptomatic patients without a negative swab or clearance from an infectious disease specialist or department;\n",
            " • asymptomatic patients with epidemiological risk factors; and • unconscious patients unable to provide risk screening information, specifically patients presenting with trauma and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n",
            " The merit of performing routine reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing of all patients planned for cardiothoracic surgery is debatable. Interpreting the result depends on the accuracy of the test and the pre-test probability of disease. It may allow positive patients to be identified and timing of surgery to be reconsidered due to the high specificity. 9 A single negative test result, however, should not be used as to rule out patients with strongly suggestive symptoms. A systematic review of the accuracy of COVID-19 tests reported false negative rates of between 2% and 54%. 10 Currently, risk stratification according to the patient's clinical circumstances and local COVID-19 epidemiology is the most appropriate strategy.\n",
            " The majority of cardiothoracic surgical cases are performed for prognostic reasons. The timing of these procedures will depend on a balance between the benefit to the patient, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, resource availability, and local government restrictions.\n",
            " As COVID-19 can present with both cardiac and respiratory symptoms, it is vital that patients are appropriately screened and that a differential diagnosis of COVID-19 be considered. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons recommends that positive or suspected patients be managed conservatively, if possible, with their surgery delayed. 3 If emergency surgery is required then patients should be risk assessed. It should be remembered that acute coronary syndrome is a common cardiac manifestation of COVID-19. 11 A statement from the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand provides guidance on the management of such patients. 11 Data on the risk of COVID-19-positive patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery are limited, although high peri-operative mortality is suggested. A study from Wuhan in patients undergoing non-cardiac elective surgery during the incubation period of COVID-19 demonstrated a 44% intensive care requirement and 20% mortality. 12\n",
            " Most SARS-CoV-2 spread is likely to be direct or indirect (fomite) contact or droplet spread. The World Health Organization indicates that airborne spread may occur but only during aerosolgenerating procedures. 2 Clinical risk data on aerosol risk of transmission are summarised in a systematic review of severe acute respiratory syndrome, 13 although the ten studies included were classified by GRADE as very low quality evidence. Procedures presenting an increased risk of transmission included tracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, manual ventilation before intubation and tracheostomy.\n",
            " The mechanisms responsible for the generation of aerosolised particles require disruption of the surface tension of the respiratory tract lining fluid. 14 This may be caused by high shear forces or manual or mechanical disruption during lung surgery.\n",
            " A number of procedures are at a high risk of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery. These include bag-mask ventilation; tracheal intubation; tracheal extubation; bronchoscopy; lung isolation; continuous positive airway pressure; lung recruitment or reinflation; lung injury, air leak, bronchopleural fistula or decortication; and chest drain management.\n",
            " The magnitude and spread of SARS-CoV-2 will vary greatly over time and geographical location and, therefore, advice may change with respect to low risk patients undergoing procedures at high risk of aerosol generation, depending on the community 1 Key recommendations General considerations:\n",
            " • The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Patient and staff management principles should be applied in the light of the specific regional and temporal context of the pandemic.\n",
            " • Patient risk stratification is important and may be guided by national guidelines. 8 • Local prevalence may be used to guide decisions around routine pre-operative testing.\n",
            " • Most SARS-CoV-2 spread is likely to be contact or droplet related. Aerosol spread is likely to be of lower overall frequency but certain procedures, during thoracic surgery especially, present a high risk of aerosol generation.\n",
            " • Conservative management or considered delay of confirmed or suspected COVID-19-positive patients may benefit patients and health care workers.\n",
            " • COVID-19 theatre planning should consider theatre airflow, contamination zones, theatre personnel present, additional staff roles, personal protective equipment and appropriate staff briefings.\n",
            " Procedural considerations:\n",
            " • Experienced clinicians in cardiothoracic anaesthesia and surgery should be involved in the operative care of cardiothoracic surgical COVID-19 patients.\n",
            " • Aerosols may be highest around intubation, extubation and open circuits, which are often a part of thoracic anaesthesia. Steps should be taken to minimise required disconnections and/or aerosolisation during these periods.\n",
            " • The aerosol risk from transoesophageal echocardiography may be amplified by coughing and gagging. It is appropriate to consider the riskbenefit balance for transoesophageal echocardiography and practical interventions to reduce risk.\n",
            " • Aerosol generation may occur with surgical opening of the lungs and surgical trauma. Predefined procedures to respond to such scenarios should be considered and practised.\n",
            " • The risk of viral transmission via cardiopulmonary bypass circuit oxygenators is unknown. Scavenging similar to that attached to anaesthetic machines may minimise potential risk.\n",
            " • Chest drain management should include the use of viral filters on the chest drain exhaust to minimise the risk of aerosolisation of the virus. transmission and the potential for asymptomatic patients attending for procedures.\n",
            " Due to the number and frequency of aerosolising procedures performed during thoracic surgery, we believe this surgery, in particular, has the potential to generate high volumes of prolonged and ongoing aerosol generation. As such, in areas or times when risk of community transmission is high, it may be reasonable to adopt airborne precautions for all thoracic patients irrespective of COVID-19 status to protect staff. 15 Management of such patients should be in keeping with national, regional and institutional policies and with recognition of the requirement to conserve PPE.\n",
            " There should be a designated operating room to manage COVID-19 patients, with a protocol for patient flow to and from the operating room. 16 Negative (or neutral) pressure rooms are preferred. Dirty and clean buffer zones should be observed and staff and equipment should be kept to a minimum. Disposable equipment should be used where available and clean runners should be available to provide additional instruments, drugs and equipment.\n",
            " Team briefings are important. These should aim to introduce the team, discuss the surgery, identify aerosolising procedures, and review protocols. Communication may be difficult in PPE and this should be recognised.\n",
            " The peak risk period during cardiac surgical procedures is intubation and extubation. The Safe Airway Society has produced guidelines for airway management in the COVID-19 environment. 17 Intubation and extubation processes should follow these accepted guidelines to minimise aerosolisation. There should be a wait time, if possible, for the aerosol risk to subside, with a recommendation of three to five air changes (about 15 minutes). 15 When transferring intubated patients to the intensive care unit, the number and duration of breathing circuit disconnections should be minimised, with processes to prevent aerosols as per Safe Airway Society guidance. 17\n",
            " Lung isolation can be achieved by a number of measures. Options include left-or right-sided double lumen tubes, bronchial blockers, or a single lumen tube advanced into the nonoperative lung. 18 The European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology has published recommendations for airway management in thoracic anaesthesia. 19 A survey conducted by the Association showed that the choice of lung isolation management is likely to be influenced by the intubation status of the patient, predicted airway difficulty and individual preference. 19 Many steps involved in the achievement and troubleshooting of lung isolation are high aerosolising procedures. There are a number of adaptations that we suggest be adopted to minimise this.\n",
            " Intubation should be undertaken as per Safe Airway Society guidance, with an experienced thoracic anaesthetist. Clinical assessment of double lumen tube placement can be performed by inspecting and auscultating, while sequentially clamping the tracheal and bronchial arms without disconnection. This may avoid the need for bronchoscopy.\n",
            " Another option is to confirm lung ventilation with ultrasound, looking for lung sliding (ventilation) and absence of lung sliding and lung pulse (no ventilation but no pneumothorax). 20 If bronchoscopy is required for positioning or troubleshooting, this should be performed with the ventilator disabled, without positive pressure on the circuit, and with the patient adequately paralysed.\n",
            " Double lumen tubes with embedded cameras may reduce the requirement for bronchoscopy. 21 There will be a learning curve associated with these devices. Although they may reduce the aerosol risk during placement, they are not a substitute for the wider use of bronchoscopy during thoracic surgery.\n",
            " During lung isolation, we recommend that viral filters be placed on each limb of the double lumen tube to protect against aerosols during deflation and any leak of ventilated gas. Paediatric filters may be useful to reduce the weight and kinking of the tube (Box 2, A). Application of continuous positive airway pressure to the non-ventilated lung, if required, should be performed with the filter in place.\n",
            " Suctioning of the lung is often required and we recommend using closed in-line suction. This should be inserted with the ventilator disabled and the tube clamped to minimise aerosol generation (Box 2, B) . The patient should be adequately paralysed to prevent coughing. Self-sealing suction-safe connectors can also be placed to minimise circuit disconnections.\n",
            " Any thoracic surgical procedure where there is presence or creation of alveolar, parenchymal or bronchopleural leak should be considered an open airway and high risk for aerosol generation. This includes lung resection surgery, decortication and pneumothorax surgery. While many surgeons use lung resection techniques that minimise an open bronchial tree or alveolar leak, these cannot guarantee freedom from aerosols. Pulmonary decortication is frequently associated with alveolar air leak and should be considered very high risk. Airborne PPE should be employed for these procedures.\n",
            " Bronchoscopy is at high risk for aerosol generation and should be minimised. 17 We recommend all bronchoscopy should be videoscopic, with airborne PPE employed. Rigid bronchoscopy is very high risk and should be avoided.\n",
            " If virus is present in the pleural space then there is risk of aerosolisation at the chest drain exhaust. 22 Chest drain insertion, even by careful closed technique, is a risk. When an underwater drain bottle is on suction, the risk is minimal; however, if the bottle is open to air then risk exists, which will be higher with any air leak.\n",
            " To minimise risk, a viral filter can be applied to the exhaust vent. 22 Suction can then be connected to the filter exhaust (Box 3). The resistance of the viral filter up to a flow of 30 L/min has been found to be trivial, correlating with clinical experience that the filter does not impede airflow out of the chest. 23 It is important, however, that filters be checked and changed daily.\n",
            " Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) carries a high risk of aerosol generation in an awake or sedated patient because of the risk of coughing. In an anaesthetised, paralysed patient with a cuffed endotracheal tube, the risk is currently unknown, and some regions have determined TOE in intubated patients to be non-aerosolising.\n",
            " The American and British Societies of Echocardiography, however, consider TOE to be an aerosol-generating procedure regardless of intubation status. 24, 25 Both societies recommend airborne precautions and the most experienced sonographer to perform the TOE.\n",
            " We recommend that the requirement for TOE be considered on an individual case basis rather than routine utilisation. If necessary, practical interventions to prevent cross-infection can be considered, including plastic TOE covers, dedicated equipment, a two-person technique to manipulate probe and acquire images, a plastic barrier over the patient during manipulation, and probe removal and decontamination protocols.\n",
            " There is some evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in blood. 26 It is also possible for the virus to cross the membrane and aerosolise through the gas exit port of the membrane lung during cardiopulmonary bypass, although the risk is extremely low. 26 The Australian and New Zealand College of Perfusionists has produced a statement on this matter. 27 As per existing guidelines, it is recommended that oxygenators be scavenged similarly to anaesthetic ventilators. 28\n",
            " Lung trauma may occur at many stages during cardiac surgery. Although there are limited data, we believe that an open pleural space without air leak is relatively low risk for aerosols. However, lung injury may occur on opening the pleura, internal thoracic artery harvest and sternal wire placement. Staff conducting cardiac surgery on patients at high risk of COVID-19 should employ airborne PPE. Inadvertent lung injury in patients at low risk of COVID-19 can be managed with standard PPE, with an appropriate protocol in place for visceral pleura breach in times and regions of high community transmission. A suggested approach would be to stop ventilation, pack lung, recommence ventilation at low tidal volume, adopt airborne precautions, temporarily discontinue ventilation, seal air leak, and recommence ventilation.\n",
            " Training of junior doctors is always a high priority. Care must be taken in the current environment that this is always done with safety in mind. Appropriate case selection and consideration of the duration of operations are important.

            " En búsqueda de fuentes de información y datos desagregados por sexo respecto a la infección por COVID-19, hoy, 19 de abril de 2020, he visitado la web del CIBERESP. Sorprendentemente, en su buscador solo aparecen tres menciones referidas a la misma noticia referente a las ayudas a la movilidad intra-CIBERESP 2020. En coherencia con las medidas de salud pública promovidas por las autoridades sanitarias frente a COVID-19 se especifica que las convocatorias de ayudas a la movilidad quedan en suspenso hasta nuevo aviso, lo cual es comprensible; no lo es tanto el no encontrar más información. ¿Qué está haciendo el CIBERESP con relación al COVID-19? Estoy segura de que muchos de sus investigadores y grupos están trabajando en ello, como hacen otras instituciones relacionadas de manera directa o indirecta con la salud y la ciencia. Es el caso del Ministerio de Sanidad y el Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación; de las Consejerías de Sanidad de las Comunidades Autónomas; de las revistas científicas internacionales de alto impacto que han puesto a disposición en abierto el conocimiento que diariamente se va publicando; o de la propia revista Gaceta Sanitaria, que ha creado un espacio de contenido especial sobre COVID-19 1,2 . La misión del CIBERESP es constituir una estructura de investigación en red mediante acciones de coordinación, colaboración y gestión estratégica de los grupos de investigación distribuidos por toda la geografía. Más que nunca, y de manera urgente, el CIBERESP debe estar presente en la crisis del COVID-19 haciendo visibles los proyectos y la producción científica de sus grupos de investigación.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Em dezembro de 2019, o surto do COVID-19 na China foi noticiado [26] . Devido ao rápido espalhamento do vírus no mundo, a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) declarou estado de emergência. Recentes pesquisas confirmaram que a atual pandemia pode dobrar o número de pessoas infectadas a cada 7 (sete) dias e que cada paciente pode espalhar o vírus, na média, para 2.2 outras pessoas [37] . Na América Latina, houve o registro de 718,615 casos de COVID-19 e 39,229 mortes confirmadas até o dia 25 de maio de 2020 [28] . No continente, o Brasilé o país mais afetado pela doença. De acordo com o mesmo relatório [28] , houve o registro de 347,398 casos de infectados e de 22,013 mortes no Brasil.\n",
            " Devido a propagação da doença no mundo, as plataformas de mídias sociais como Twitter, Facebook e Instagram tornaram-se locais onde ocorre uma intensa e contínua troca de informações entreórgãos governamentais, profissionais daárea de saúde e o público em geral. Um representativo número de estudos científicos têm mostrado que as mídias sociais podem desempenhar um papel importante como fonte de dados para análise de crises e também para entender atitudes e comportamentos das pessoas durante uma pandemia [22, 19, 12] .\n",
            " Com o objetivo de auxiliar o monitoramento da saúde pública e também para dar suporte a tomada de decisão de profissionais, diversos sistemas de monitoramento vêm sendo desenvolvidos para classificar grandes quantidades de dados oriundos das mídias sociais. Estes dados podem ser empregados para identificar rapidamente os pensamentos, atitudes, sentimentos e tópicos que ocupam as mentes das pessoas em relaçãoà pandemia do COVID-19 [3] . A análise sistemática desses dados pode ajudar os governantes, profissionais da saúde e o público em geral a identificar questões que mais lhes interessam e tratá-las de maneira mais apropriada. arXiv:2012.05836v1 [cs.SI] 20 Nov 2020 TECHNICAL REPORT -11 DE DEZEMBRO DE 2020 Dentre as plataformas de mídias sociais, o Twitteré uma das mais populares. De acordo com [14] , existe aproximadamente 200 milhões de usuários registrados nesta plataforma e que publicam mais de 500 milhões de tuítes diariamente. Portanto, pode-se aproveitar desse alto volume e troca frequente de informações para se conhecer as dúvidas sobre determinadas crises. Como exemplo de importância desta plataforma em situações de crise, a atual pandemia de COVID-19 foi primeiro comunicada para a populacão na China através do site Weibo, queé o correspondente ao Twitter na China, antes mesmo do pronunciamento oficial das autoridades locais. Recentemente, existe um grande interesse de pesquisadores investigando o uso do Twitter para pesquisas relacionadasà saúde pública [3, 22, 27, 23] .\n",
            " Diante deste cenário, nós apresentamos um estudo exploratório de mineração de opinião das mensagens de usuários do Twitter relacionadasà COVID-19. Mais especificamente, nós focamos a nossa análise nas perguntas dos usuários, pois entendemos que seja um tipo de mensagem apropriado para se compreender as principais dúvidas das pessoas sobre a atual pandemia. A nossa análise se concentrará em postagens em português pelo fato do Brasil ser o país mais populoso da América Latina e também o país mais afetado pela COVID-19. Para isto, nós coletamos e processamos os tuítes postados em português de 1 o de janeiro a 30 de abril de 2020. Os tuítes coletados foram processados e as perguntas foram identificadas. Nós analisamos os tuítes coletados usando a técnica de modelagem de tópicos para identificar os principais tópicos discutidos pelas pessoas no Twitter. Nós ainda desenvolvemos um modelo de Reconhecimento de Entidades Mencionadas (REM) que permite identificar as principais menções a um grupo pré-definido de entidades: a) doenças; b) medicamentos; c) pessoas; d) organizações. A análise desses dados pode ajudar os formuladores de políticas públicas e as organizações de assistência médica a compreender as principais questões do público em geral.\n",
            " Dentre as nossas descobertas, nós conseguimos identificar a mudança da percepção dos usuários, ao longo do tempo, em relaçãoà doença. A preocupação com a morte somente ficou evidenciada após o registro, em março de 2020, do primeiro caso de brasileiro morto por COVID-19. Foi possível ainda perceber que, ao aplicarmos a identificação das entidades nomeadas das perguntas, há muita dúvida sobre os tipos de medicamentos que poderiam ser utilizados para combater a doença. A identificação das dúvidas mais comuns sobre o uso dos medicamentos poderia ajudar os agentes públicos no enfretamento da doença através, por exemplo, de campanhas publicitárias para elucidação dos principais questionamentos.\n",
            " Resumidamente, as contribuições deste trabalho são: \n",
            " Modelagem de tópicosé uma das técnicas mais empregadas na mineração de dados, descoberta de dados latentes, e identificação de relacionamentos entre dados e documentos textuais [17] . Nós adotamos o modelo Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [5] para identificar os tópicos relevantes sobre a COVID-19 no nosso conjunto de dados. LDA permite descobrir tópicos latentes usando a distribuição de probabilidade multinomial dos termos em documentos não estruturados. Similarmente aos métodos descritos em [36] e [27] , nós executamos os experimentos variando o número de tópicos. Nos nossos experimentos, nós aplicamos a variação de tópicos de 1 a 60, e selecionamos o modelo com o maior valor de pontuação de coerência (coherence score). A geração dos tópicos foi executada para cada mês com o objetivo de identificar a mudança dos tópicos discutidos no Twitter ao longo do quadrimestre.\n",
            " Nós selecionamos o modelo que gerou 20 tópicos, com um valor médio de pontuação de coerência entre os quatro meses de 0.674. Este valoré usado como uma métrica que calcula a concordância de um conjunto de pares e subconjunto de palavras e as probabilidades associadas em umúnico valor [31] . Em geral, os tópicos são interpretados como sendo coerentes se todos os termos, ou a maioria destes, são relacionados. A Figura 3 apresenta o gráfico da relação do número de tópicos com a pontuação de coerência.É possível notar que a pontuação de coerência tende a reduzir quando o número de tópicos seja superior a 20.\n",
            " A Figura 4 apresenta a distribuição do número de tópicos para cada mês. Nós observamos que existe certos tópicos que são mais populares. Ao analisarmos o tópico com maior número de postagens em cada mês, nós percebemos que esseé um tópico geral que agrupou termos relativosà própria doença.\n",
            " Reconhecimento de Entidades Mencionadas (REM)é definida como uma tarefa não-trivial de automaticamente identificar e classificar certas menções a entidades em um dado texto [21] . Por exemplo, na sentença \"Chá de alho cura coronavírus?\" postada por um dos usuáriosé possível identificar uma dúvida sobre o uso de tratamentos alternativos para a cura da COVID-19. Neste caso, apesar de chá de alho não ser um tipo de medicamento oficialmente reconhecido, o modelo REMé capaz de identificar que muitas pessoas consideram este tipo de chá como um medicamento para a COVID-19.\n",
            " Os métodos que lidam com a tarefa de reconhecer entidades mencionadas são baseados principalmente em modelos de aprendizagem de máquina [9, 33, 4] . A extração de entidades mencionadas no Twitteré uma tarefa ainda mais desafiadora [6] . Primeiro, as postagens no Twitter são curtas (máximo de 280 caracteres) e, portanto, são mais difíceis de se interpretar quando comparadas com textos mais longos. Segundo, os textos curtos apresentam muitas variações linguísticas e tendem a ser menos corretos em termos gramaticais. Porúltimo, a maioria das pesquisas sobre ferramentas de processamento de linguagem natural são voltadas para o idioma inglês [32] .\n",
            " Para esta tarefa, nós usamos a ferramenta spaCy [16] \n",
            " Nesta seção, nós discutimos a criação e a performance do modelo REM proposto e também a aplicação do modelo no conjunto de dados coletados. Para o modelo REM proposto, nós consideramos quatro entidades: Doença (DIS), Medicamento (DRUG), Organização (ORG) e Pessoa (PER). Para cada tipo de entidade mencionada, nós usamos as métricas de Precision (P), Recall (R) e F-Measure (F1). Precision corresponde ao percentual correto de menções a entidades, recall corresponde ao percentual do total de entidades que foram corretamente reconhecidas pelo modelo, enquanto F-Measure (F1)é a média harmônica entre precisão e revocação. Estas métricas são comumente utilizadas para avaliar a performance de modelos de REM [21, 18, 24, 11] .\n",
            " Com o objetivo de treinar o novo modelo, nós fizemos a anotação dos dados de treino. Para esta tarefa, nós usamos a ferramenta WebAnno [10] . A Figura 5 mostra uma captura de tela da ferramenta e alguns exemplos de anotações das entidades. [7] .\n",
            " Assim como ocorreu na aplicação do LDA para geração de tópicos, os termos representados como n-grams não apareceram destacados na nuvem de palavras.\n",
            " Nós iniciamos esta seção discutindo algumas limitações atribuídas a este estudo. Os dados foram obtidos através de um conjunto pré-definido de palavras-chaves. Portanto,é possível que alguns usuários tenham publicado mensagens sobre a pandemia de COVID-19 usando um conjunto de termos diferentes das palavras-chaves usadas na coleta e, consequentemente, estas mensagens não foram coletadas. Outra limitaçãoé que o Twitter não divulga dados sobre o perfil de seus usuários, tais como idade, sexo ou classe social. Assim, não foi possível realizar uma análise estratificada dos usuários e a amostragem analisada pode não representar toda a população brasileira. Além disso, uma limitaçãoé que focamos exclusivamente nos dados de redes sociais e, portanto, nossas conclusões não podem ser generalizáveis para outras plataformas de mídias sociais ou outros meios de comunicação, tais como TV ou rádio. Finalmente, apesar do Twitter ser uma plataforma bastante popular no Brasil, esta nãoé utilizada por toda a população. Assim, recomenda-se cautela antes de assumir a generalização dos resultados.\n",
            " A pandemia do COVID-19 vem ceifando a vida de milhões de pessoas no mundo. Atualmente, muitas pessoas fazem uso das mídias sociais como o Twitter para expressar diversos tipos de questionamentos sobre a doença. A compreensão das dúvidas comuns dos usuários dessas redes sociais pode ser um ponto de partida para projetar mensagens estratégicas para campanhas de saúde e estabelecer um sistema de comunicação eficaz durante a pandemia para um melhor enfrentamentoà doença.\n",
            " Como trabalhos futuros, nós pretendemos investigar a aplicação dos métodos desenvolvidos neste trabalho em outras fontes de mídias sociais, tais como, Instagram, Facebook e YouTube. Além disso, nós pretendemos estender o estudo para incluir dados de períodos mais longos, mesmo após o fim da pandemia. O objetivoé entender a manifestação das pessoas sobre o surto da doença.\n",

            " Alors que la cinquième vague de Covid-19 connaît un rebondissement impressionnant dû à la diffusion incontrôlable du variant Omicron dans le monde entier, la vaccination revient au premier rang des contre-mesures opposables aux conséquences de cette exacerbation épidémique. Face à l'augmentation considérable du nombre quotidien de nouvelles contaminations, à la saturation des services de soins intensifs, due en partie aux formes les plus sévères de la maladie, et à la nécessité de déprogrammer un nombre croissant d'interventions réglées, plusieurs pays européens (Grèce, Autriche, Italie, Allemagne) mettent en place ou envisagent une obligation vaccinale. Au mois de mai 2021, dès que la France a pu disposer d'un nombre suffisant de doses de vaccins pour immuniser toute sa population, l'Académie nationale de médecine s'est prononcée en faveur d'une obligation en suggérant de rendre la vaccination contre le SARS-CoV-2 exigible pour toute activité comportant un rassemblement de personnes, le statut vaccinal individuel étant contrôlable au moyen d'un passe vaccinal [1]. L'instauration du passe sanitaire entré en vigueur le 9 juin 2021 a été une étape importante dans la lutte contre la pandémie en incitant plusieurs millions de Français à se faire vacciner pour accéder aux établissements recevant du public et, à partir du 9 août, aux cafés, restaurants, hôpitaux, maisons de retraite, avions et trajets de longue distance en car ou en train. Cette mesure a cependant été trop tardive pour contenir la 4 ème vague de l'épidémie apparue au mois de juillet et trop partielle pour éviter la 5 ème vague apparue au mois de novembre, 10% des personnes éligibles pour la vaccination (c'est-à-dire âgées de 12 ans et plus) n'étant toujours pas vaccinées. Le projet de loi sur la transformation du passe sanitaire en passe vaccinal actuellement examiné par les parlementaires offre une opportunité salutaire aux personnes non vaccinées de bénéficier le plus tôt possible d'une protection immunitaire, au moins contre les formes sévères de la maladie et le risque de décès. C'est un choix nécessaire pour augmenter l'immunité collective en cas d'émergence de nouveaux variants. L'Académie nationale de médecine tient toutefois à préciser : -que la doctrine du passe vaccinal doit être clairement exposée et sincèrement défendue comme une obligation vaccinale, non déguisée, au même titre que les autres obligations vaccinales actuellement en vigueur ; -que, face à une épidémie mortifère non contrôlable par tout autre moyen, la vaccination obligatoire est un devoir civique et non une menace de punition : annoncée comme une mobilisation générale contre un ennemi commun, le SARS-CoV-2, elle devrait entraîner l'adhésion d'une très large majorité des Français ; -que l'exigibilité du passe vaccinal doit être élargie à tous les lieux de rassemblement (travail, loisirs, commerces, transports en commun), sans oublier les personnes intervenant à domicile auprès de personnes âgées et/ou vulnérables (femmes de ménage, aides familiales…), toute dérogation au principe d'universalité limitant sa portée et réduisant son efficacité ; -que les rares contre-indications médicales, définitives ou temporaires, à la vaccination contre la COVID-19 doivent se référer à l'avis fourni par le Collège de la HAS [2] .\n",

            " Frente à pandemia da doença causada pelo novo coronavírus (COVID- 19) , o manejo do paciente com fator de risco e/ou doença cardiovascular é desafiador nos dias de hoje. As complicações cardiovasculares evidenciadas nos pacientes com COVID-19 resultam de vários mecanismos, que vão desde lesão direta pelo vírus até complicações secundárias à resposta inflamatória e trombótica desencadeada pela infecção. O cuidado adequado do paciente com COVID-19 exige atenção ao sistema cardiovascular em busca de melhores desfechos.\n",
            " O mundo hoje vive a pandemia da doença causada pelo novo coronavírus , afecção que surgiu em dezembro de 2019 na cidade de Wuhan, província de Hubei, na China. 1, 2 Os casos iniciais foram descritos como pneumonia de rápida evolução para síndrome do desconforto respiratório agudo (SDRA). Embora existam semelhanças filogenéticas entre o SARS-CoV-2 e os coronavírus zoonóticos que causaram a SARS e a MERS, a transmissibilidade do SARS-CoV-2 é muito maior, contribuindo para uma disseminação da infecção até dez vezes mais rápida que a do SARS-CoV. [2] [3] [4] O número básico de reprodução (R0) da doença é de 2,78, ou seja, cada indivíduo infectado tem a capacidade de transmitir a doença para em média 3 pessoas. 5 Em estudo recente publicado na revista Science, em modelo matemático, postulou-se que cerca de 85% das transmissões da COVID-19 ocorram por indivíduos assintomáticos. 6 Em decorrência da rápida disseminação, a COVID-19 foi declarada uma pandemia pela Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) em 11 de março de 2020. 4 Atualmente, a COVID-19 afeta mais de 181 países em todo o mundo e o número de casos cresce de forma exponencial. Até 2 de abril de 2020, havia um total de 1.015.403 casos registrados globalmente e 53.030 mortes, o que resulta em uma taxa de letalidade de 5,2%. Na mesma data, o Brasil computava 8.044 casos confirmados e 324 óbitos, com mortalidade de 4%. Dados brasileiros iniciais mostram que 90% dos óbitos ocorreram em pessoas com idade maior de 60 anos e 84% dos pacientes apresentavam pelo menos uma comorbidade, sendo que 51% tinham doença cardiovascular (DCV) e 37,7% tinham diabetes. 7 A análise de 44.672 casos confirmados de COVID-19 em Wuhan evidenciou uma taxa de letalidade geral de 2,3%. Porém, a letalidade foi maior em DCV (10,5%), diabetes (7,3%) e hipertensão arterial (6%). 8 Também foram descritas complicações cardiovasculares decorrentes da COVID-19, como injúria miocárdica (20% dos casos), arritmias (16%), miocardite (10%), além de insuficiência cardíaca (IC) e choque (até 5% dos casos). [9] [10] [11] O objetivo desta revisão é auxiliar o clínico, o emergencista, o cardiologista e o intensivista na assistência aos pacientes com COVID-19, propondo um algoritmo de avaliação cardiovascular para a detecção precoce de complicações, além de recomendar protocolos de tratamento de complicações cardiovasculares nesses pacientes.\n",
            " Dados recentes da pandemia da COVID- 19 viral que leva à lesão do sistema cardiovascular e dos pulmões,  com elevação de dímero-D, procalcitonina, proteína C  reativa, ferritina, troponina e NT-proBNP, e que culmina em  complicações cardiovasculares e óbito. Na resposta inflamatória sistêmica provocada pela COVID-19, observam-se concentrações mais altas de citocinas que estão relacionadas à injúria do sistema cardiovascular. 15 O aumento de troponina é acompanhado de elevação de outros marcadores inflamatórios, como dímero-D, ferritina, interleucina-6 (IL-6), desidrogenase láctica (DHL), proteína C reativa, procalcitonina e contagem de leucócitos. 1, 11 Zhou et al. mostraram que os pacientes que evoluíram a óbito apresentaram níveis mais altos de dímero-D, IL-6, ferritina e DHL, além de linfopenia, sugerindo que esses marcadores inflamatórios possam ter implicações prognósticas. Dímero-D na admissão maior que 1µg/ml foi preditor independente de mortalidade nessa população. 12 Além da elevação dos marcadores inflamatórios, nos pacientes com COVID-19 também se observa aumento nos níveis de BNP ou NT-proBNP, marcadores de disfunção miocárdica. Pacientes com injúria miocárdica tiveram níveis mais altos de NT-proBNP, com correlação linear positiva. 10, 11 Esse achado reforça que aqueles que apresentam injúria miocárdica estão mais propensos a desenvolver comprometimento da função cardíaca. 10 Numa meta-análise de quatro estudos, incluindo um total de 341 pacientes, os níveis de troponina I foram significativamente maiores naqueles com a forma grave da COVID-19 em comparação àqueles com a forma não grave. 16 Os pacientes com injúria miocárdica internaram mais em unidade de terapia intensiva (UTI) ( Complicações cardiovasculares, como IC, miocardite, infarto agudo do miocárdico, choque e arritmias, também são frequentes em pacientes com injúria miocárdica. Em uma coorte com 150 pacientes, 7% deles desenvolveram dano miocárdio e IC irreversíveis, associados a elevações significativas dos níveis de troponina. 17 Arritmias malignas (taquicardia ventricular com degeneração para fibrilação ventricular ou instabilidade hemodinâmica) foram observadas com maior frequência nos grupos com elevação dos níveis de troponina (11,5% vs 5,2%). 10 Pacientes com COVID-19, quando apresentam a forma grave da doença, podem evoluir rapidamente para quadro com importante comprometimento cardiovascular, choque e falência múltipla de órgãos. Nas coortes chinesas com pacientes internados, até 20% evoluíram para quadros graves com choque. 9, 12 Miocardite pode estar relacionada a falência cardíaca aguda nos pacientes com COVID-19. Foram descritos casos de miocardite relacionada à COVID-19, como miocardite fulminante, de rápida evolução e disfunção ventricular importante, associada a edema miocárdico difuso. Alterações eletrocardiográficas e elevação de troponina estavam presentes nesses pacientes. 14, 18, 19 Apesar de não haver relato de ST diretamente relacionada à COVID-19, postula-se que alguns casos de disfunção ventricular nesses pacientes possam decorrer dessa síndrome. A ST é complicação frequente em indivíduos com resposta inflamatória sistêmica exacerbada, funcionando o estresse e a gravidade da infecção viral como gatilho para a ST. 20\n",
            " Interação do SARS-CoV-2 com a enzima de conversão da angiotensina 2\n",
            " Alguns estudos sugerem que a lesão ao sistema cardiovascular secundária ao vírus possa estar relacionada à enzima de conversão da angiotensina 2 (ECA2). 13, 15 A ECA2 está relacionada ao sistema imune e presente em alta concentração no pulmão e no coração. A ECA2 regula negativamente o sistema renina angiotensina pela inativação da angiotensina-2 e provavelmente tem um papel protetor contra o desenvolvimento de insuficiência respiratória e sua progressão. O SARS-CoV-2 contém quatro proteínas estruturais principais: a proteína spike (S), a proteína nucleocapsídeo (N), a proteína membrana (M) e o envelope proteico (E). O vírus liga-se por meio da proteína spike ao receptor da ECA2 e, por meio dessa ligação, entra na célula hospedeira (Figura 2), onde ocorre a inativação da ECA2, o que favorece a lesão pulmonar. Como a ECA2 apresenta concentrações elevadas no coração, lesões potencialmente graves ao sistema cardiovascular podem ocorrer. 13, 21 Pacientes com DCV preexistente parecem ter níveis séricos aumentados da ECA2, o que pode contribuir para as manifestações mais graves nessa população. [22] [23] [24] Da mesma forma, indivíduos com hipertensão arterial apresentariam maior expressão da ECA2 secundária ao uso de inibidores da enzima de conversão da angiotensina (IECA) ou bloqueadores do receptor da angiotensina II (BRA), o que potencialmente aumentaria a susceptibilidade à infecção pelo SARS-CoV-2. 4 Entretanto, os estudos atuais em humanos apresentaram limitações: a) avaliaram um número pequeno de indivíduos em uso dessas medicações, e b) grande parte dos analisados era de idosos, fator confundidor importante, uma vez que a idade avançada aumenta a susceptibilidade à infecção, além de esse ser o principal fator de mau prognóstico. 25 Outro ponto a ser considerado é que, apesar de a ECA2 e a ECA serem enzimas com estruturas homólogas, os sítios de ativação são distintos e, dessa forma, a inibição da ECA não teria efeito direto sobre a atividade da ECA2; essa enzima tem papel bem reconhecido na recuperação da função ventricular em pacientes com lesão miocárdica, por sua inibição da atividade da angiotensina II. 26 Por outro lado, sugere-se que a angiotensina II seja responsável pelo dano cardíaco do coronavírus e a administração de ECA2 recombinante normalizaria os níveis de angiotensina II. Estudos estão sendo realizados com ECA2 recombinante e com losartana. 25 A recomendação atual é que os IECA e os BRA sejam mantidos nos pacientes que já estão em uso regular dessas medicações pelo claro benefício do controle pressóricos e da diminuição de mortalidade naqueles com IC, como evidenciado em estudos randomizados. 27, 28 Nas formas graves da COVID-19, deve-se avaliar individualmente a estabilidade hemodinâmica e a função renal antes de decidir pela manutenção ou suspensão das medicações.\n",
            " A doença cardiovascular como grupo de risco para forma grave de COVID-19\n",
            " Pacientes com fatores de risco cardiovasculares (idade avançada, hipertensão e diabetes), assim como aqueles com DCV (doença arterial coronária, cardiomiopatias e doença cerebrovascular) estão suscetíveis a desenvolver a forma grave da doença e complicações cardiovasculares, sendo classificados como grupo de risco. Aproximadamente 80% dos pacientes com a forma grave da doença têm alguma comorbidade. 29 A Tabela 1 apresenta um resumo dos principais estudos que caracterizam as comorbidades clínicas dos pacientes com COVID-19. [9] [10] [11] [12] 17, [29] [30] [31] [32] Meta-análise recente que incluiu oito estudos da China, com 46.248 pacientes infectados, mostrou que as comorbidades mais prevalentes foram hipertensão (17 ± 7%) e diabetes mellitus (8 ± 6%), seguidas por DCV (5 ± 4%). Wang et al. avaliaram apenas pacientes hospitalizados por COVID-19 e observaram maior prevalência de hipertensão (31,2%), DCV (19,6%) e diabetes (10,1%), 9 reforçando que os indivíduos com essas comorbidades apresentam forma mais grave da COVID-19, com maior necessidade de internação hospitalar. Esses pacientes evoluíram com mais hipoxemia e maior necessidade de internação em UTI. 9,30 Idade avançada, de modo semelhante, está relacionada à forma grave da doença. A mediana de idade nesses estudos variou de 42 a 64 anos, 11,30 sendo maior em pacientes graves (64 vs 51,5). 29 A idade também foi mais elevada nos internados em UTI e naqueles com hipoxemia. 9, 30 As complicações cardiovasculares também foram frequentes nos pacientes do grupo de risco. Aqueles com DCV cursam com elevação de troponina e maiores taxas de choque e arritmias. 10 \n",
            " Apesar de não haver recomendações formais sobre a avaliação cardiovascular do paciente com infecção suspeita ou confirmada por SARS-CoV-2, acredita-se que seja benéfica em: a) pacientes que tenham DCV preexistente ou fatores de risco cardiovasculares; b) pacientes que apresentem sinais e sintomas cardiovasculares (dispneia, choque, dor precordial, alteração eletrocardiográfica ou aumento de área cardíaca); c) presença de alteração em biomarcadores como dímero-D, troponina, NT-proBNP e ferritina; e d) pacientes com necessidade de internação. Aqueles com DCV são mais propensos a sofrer injúria miocárdica após infecção por SARS-CoV-2 e apresentam maior risco de morte. 10 A ressonância magnética deve ser considerada em pacientes estáveis e pode auxiliar no diagnóstico diferencial da etiologia da disfunção ventricular, que pode estar relacionada a miocardite ou disfunção sistólica induzida por estresse. O diagnóstico de miocardite segue os critérios clássicos já validados para outras etiologias virais, nas quais podem ser observados edema miocárdico e realce tardio miocárdico de padrão não isquêmico.

O tempo médio de início dos sintomas é de 4 a 5 dias, sendo que 97,5% dos contaminados vão desenvolvê-los em até 11,5 dias da exposição. 32 A maioria dos pacientes (81%) vai apresentar sintomas leves, os principais sendo febre (88%) e tosse (67,7%). Outros menos frequentes são diarreia, mialgia, cefaleia e coriza. Aproximadamente 20% dos pacientes evoluirão de forma grave, com dispneia, taquipneia, saturação de oxigênio ≤93% e infiltrado pulmonar, e 5% desses apresentarão um quadro crítico, com sinais de choque e falência respiratória. 1, 40 Os pacientes assintomáticos ou oligossintomáticos e clinicamente estáveis não necessitam de internação hospitalar, em sua maioria. Aqueles com sintomas graves e evolução desfavorável vão requerer internação hospitalar.\n",
            " A avaliação inicial deve incluir: ECG, gasometria arterial com lactato, dímero-D, hemograma completo, avaliação de funções renal e hepática, fatores de coagulação, troponina, creatinofosfoquinase, ferritina, DHL, IL-6 e eletrólitos (sódio, magnésio, potássio e cálcio). Deve-se realizar radiografia de tórax e considerar a tomografia computadorizada (TC) de tórax em alguns casos. A TC mostra anormalidades em 85% dos pacientes, observando-se, em 75% deles, envolvimento pulmonar bilateral, comumente caracterizado por áreas de vidro fosco e consolidações subpleurais e periféricas. 41 Aqueles com indicação de internação deverão ser submetidos a uma ecocardiografia na sala de emergência ou nas primeiras horas da admissão hospitalar.\n",
            " O curso clínico é variável e potencialmente grave, pois 3,4% dos pacientes evoluem para SDRA, 32 uma proporção que aumenta nas coortes daqueles internados pela doença (19,6%) e naqueles com injúria miocárdica (58,5%). 9,11 A definição de SDRA é baseada nos critérios de Berlim: início agudo de lesão pulmonar, opacidades pulmonares bilaterais na radiografia de tórax e edema pulmonar. A definição de Berlim da SDRA estratifica a gravidade da lesão pulmonar com base na relação entre a pressão parcial arterial de oxigênio (PaO 2 ) e a fração de oxigênio inalado (FiO 2 ), medida em uma pressão expiratória final pulmonar (PEEP) ou pressão positiva contínua nas vias aéreas (CPAP) ≥ 5 cmH 2 O. Considera-se SDRA grave quando PaO 2 /FiO 2 é <100. 42 A ventilação mecânica é recomendada na presença de hipoxemia apesar da oferta de oxigênio. Estratégias de ventilação mecânica protetora devem ser empregadas, volume corrente de 6 ml/kg, com pressão de platô < 30 cmH 2 O e PEEP ajustada conforme FiO 2 . Os pacientes costumam apresentar boa complacência pulmonar apesar da hipoxemia grave. Naqueles com SDRA e PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 150, deve-se considerar a posição de pronação. Se houver dissincronia significativa com a ventilação mecânica, bloqueio neuromuscular pode ser realizado. 43 A monitorização hemodinâmica deve ser cogitada em todos os pacientes internados em UTI e com sinais de choque. A avaliação com monitores de débito minimamente invasivos e a avaliação contínua do débito cardíaco é uma estratégia a se considerar em associação com a ecocardiografia dinâmica e com a análise de marcadores de hipoperfusão tecidual, como parâmetros clínicos e a dosagem do lactato arterial, do deltaPCO 2 e do excesso de bases. Na presença de choque, a norepinefrina é o fármaco de escolha, sendo recomendada a associação da vasopressina se forem necessárias doses crescentes de noradrenalina para otimização hemodinâmica. 44 Sugere-se associação da dobutamina nos casos de disfunção cardíaca. 44 Recomenda-se o início imediato de norepinefrina, mesmo no acesso periférico, evitando-se a hipotensão prolongada, que resulta em elevadas taxas de mortalidade.\n",
            " A oxigenação por membrana extracorpórea (ECMO) pode ser necessária em pacientes com insuficiência respiratória aguda refratária às medidas iniciais. 45, 46 A princípio, a indicação é de uma ECMO venovenosa para recuperação da função pulmonar. 46, 47 Quando associada a acometimento cardiovascular importante em pacientes com disfunção ventricular grave e/ou choque cardiogênico, a ECMO venoarterial pode ser considerada. 48 A ECMO deve ser iniciada antes da instalação de falência múltipla de órgãos. 49 Tratamento específico. Até o momento, o tratamento do paciente crítico tem sido fundamentalmente pautado em medidas de suporte às disfunções orgânicas. Desde o início da pandemia, buscou-se um tratamento antiviral eficaz para a COVID-19. Na China e na Itália, nos casos graves, de uma maneira individualizada a depender da instituição, medicamentos como cloroquina (CQ) ou HCQ, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir e favipiravir têm sido utilizados. Remdesivir e favipiravir são antivirais de amplo espectro, cuja eficácia e segurança no manejo de pacientes com COVID-19 estão sendo avaliadas em ensaios clínicos randomizados. 50 A combinação lopinavir/ritonavir, utilizada no manejo da infecção pelo HIV, demonstrou, em estudo recente randomizado e controlado, ser ineficaz na infecção pelo SARS-CoV-2. 50 O difosfato de CQ e o sulfato de HCQ são medicações sabidamente úteis no tratamento da malária e de doenças autoimunes, como artrite reumatoide e lúpus eritematoso sistêmico. Em estudos experimentais, a CQ e a HCQ têm ação contra o SARS-CoV-2, por interferir com a glicosilação da ECA2 e assim reduzir a eficiência da ligação entre a ECA2 das células do hospedeiro e a proteína da superfície do coronavírus. Aqueles fármacos também agem aumentando o pH dos endossomos e lisossomos, através dos quais o processo de fusão do vírus com as células do hospedeiro e a subsequente replicação viral são inibidos. Além disso, a HCQ bloqueia a apresentação de antígeno viral às células T e a transcrição de genes pró-inflamatórios, impedindo a liberação de citocinas. Portanto, em estudos experimentais, a CQ e a HCQ impedem a entrada e a replicação viral além de atenuar O coração e a COVID-19\n",
            " Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; 114(5):805-816 a resposta inflamatória. Na China, um estudo mostrou que a CQ estava associada a maior porcentagem de cura clínica e virológica e passou então a ser adotada naquele país no tratamento da COVID-19. Um pequeno estudo relatou que a HCQ com ou sem a azitromicina reduziu a detecção do RNA do SARS-CoV-2 em swab respiratório, não tendo sido analisado desfecho clínico. [51] [52] [53] Os principais efeitos colaterais dessas medicações são intolerância gastrointestinal (náuseas e vômitos) e, no uso a longo prazo, retinopatia, maculopatia e cardiomiopatia. Efeitos comuns são bloqueio atrioventricular total, bloqueio de ramo, arritmias cardíacas, hipotensão, torsades de pointes, inversão de onda T, fibrilação ventricular e taquicardia ventricular, ainda mais frequentes no uso prolongado e na disfunção hepática e renal. Em O Ministério da Saúde do Brasil, a partir do dia 25 de março de 2020, portanto, passa a adotar a medicação como terapia adjuvante no tratamento de formas graves, exclusivamente, sem que outras medidas de suporte sejam preteridas em seu favor, conforme sugestão abaixo. A indicação considera que não existe outro tratamento específico eficaz disponível até o momento e que essa recomendação pode ser modificada a qualquer momento, a depender de novas evidências. Em 31 de março de 2020, em um estudo preprint, sem peer review, um grupo chinês demonstrou eficácia superior da HCQ em 62 pacientes analisados (com grupo controle) em casos de pneumonia leve. 55 Esse dado deverá ser confirmado em estudo com maior poder amostral e maior rigor metodológico. Outras medicações em análise são os glicocorticoides, as imunoglobulinas, o interferon e o tocilizumabe.\n",
            " Quando o paciente com COVID-19 evolui para parada cardiorrespiratória, cuidados especiais devem ser tomados, com atenção no manejo da via aérea por risco maior de contaminação da equipe pela liberação de aerossóis durante as manobras de compressão torácica e ventilação. 56, 57 Todos os profissionais de saúde que estão em contato com pacientes devem seguir as orientações locais e nacionais para controle de infecção e uso de equipamentos de proteção individual, que devem estar em locais de fácil acesso. 58, 59 Pacientes infectados com SARS-CoV-2, que correm risco de deterioração aguda ou parada cardíaca, devem ser identificados precocemente. Aqueles que foram definidos por quaisquer motivos como 'não ressuscitação cardiopulmonar' também devem ser identificados precocemente, e tal definição deve ser baseada nas diretrizes locais vigentes. 58 A causa mais provável é hipóxia; entretanto, todas as possibilidades devem ser consideradas (hipoglicemia, acidose, trombose coronariana). Os algoritmos já validados na literatura devem ser aplicados conforme a identificação de ritmos chocáveis e não chocáveis. 56, 57 A manipulação da via aérea deve ser realizada por profissionais experientes e treinados. As equipes de profissionais que cuidam de pacientes com COVID-19, sejam médicos, enfermeiros ou fisioterapeutas, têm alto risco de contrair a infecção. 60, 61 Os procedimentos de geração de aerossóis, como ventilação não invasiva, uso de cânula nasal de alto fluxo, ventilação com bolsa-valva-máscara ou bolsa-tubo endotraqueal, são de risco particularmente alto. 62 Deve-se evitar a ventilação com bolsa-valva-máscara ou bolsa-tubo endotraqueal, devido ao risco elevado de aerolização e contaminação da equipe e não há evidências de que esse tipo de ventilação seja superior à ventilação mecânica. 56 Em caso de necessidade de ventilação com bolsa-valva-máscara, deve-se selar corretamente a máscara, sendo necessário o envolvimento de mais de um profissional. Além disso, a utilização de filtros entre a máscara e a bolsa é mandatória. O estabelecimento de via aérea avançada deve ser priorizado nesses pacientes e realizado por indivíduos experientes. 56 A falha no procedimento de intubação ou impossibilidade requer o auxílio de dispositivos como tubo laríngeo ou máscara laríngea, para que permitam a ventilação mecânica em circuito fechado até que haja possibilidade de acesso definitivo à via aérea, seja por intubação traqueal ou por cricotireoidostomia. 57 No caso de parada cardiorrespiratória em pacientes sob ventilação mecânica, para que não haja contaminação por aerossóis pelas manobras de reanimação cardiopulmonar e ventilação, deve-se manter o paciente conectado ao ventilador mecânico em circuito fechado, com manutenção de FiO 2 de 100%, modo assíncrono, com frequência respiratória de 10 a 12 incursões por minuto (Figura 4). 56 Prevenção e manejo da trombose A literatura sugere que a exacerbada resposta inflamatória sistêmica presente na COVID-19 possa causar disfunção endotelial e aumento da atividade pró-coagulante, o que associado à menor oferta de oxigênio pode contribuir para a formação de trombo sobre uma placa coronariana rompida ou para a instabilidade de placa coronariana, tornando-a vulnerável. 10 síndrome coronariana aguda por desequilíbrio entre oferta e demanda de oxigênio ao miocárdio, sendo diagnosticado com infarto tipo II. Deve-se analisar individualmente os casos, porque boa parte deverá ser manejada com uma estratégia conservadora, pois cerca de 7% dos pacientes com COVID-19 e síndrome coronariana aguda podem ter infarto do miocárdio tipo II ou miocardite. 64 A definição da abordagem da síndrome coronariana aguda no paciente com COVID-19 deve levar em consideração os recursos locais disponíveis, como serviços de hemodinâmica estruturados, leito de unidade coronariana e/ou UTI e adequação do ambiente às medidas de proteção ao SARS-CoV-2. 64 Um relatório chinês sugeriu que fosse considerada a trombólise como terapia de primeira escolha nos pacientes com COVID-19. Essa recomendação é controversa, especialmente em locais em que a angioplastia primária possa ser realizada, respeitando todas as regras de segurança exigidas para proteção dos profissionais de saúde e do ambiente hospitalar (uso de equipamentos de proteção individual, sala com pressão negativa, limpeza adequada). 64 O tratamento das complicações cardiovasculares deve ser baseado no uso ideal e criterioso das terapias indicadas nas diretrizes. A abordagem terapêutica com IECA, BRA, betabloqueadores, agentes antiplaquetários e estatinas deve seguir as indicações das diretrizes, respeitando as contraindicações presentes, referentes a estabilidade hemodinâmica e presença de outras disfunções orgânicas. 21 Pacientes com COVID-19 são de elevado risco para tromboembolismo venoso, devido à prolongada redução de mobilidade e parâmetros anormais da coagulação. 4 Recomenda-se o uso de estratégias de prevenção não farmacológica para todos aqueles internados por COVID-19. Estratégias farmacológicas devem ser consideradas, como o uso de heparina não fracionada ou de heparina de baixo peso molecular, atentando-se para suas contraindicações e a depuração de creatinina do paciente. A suspeita de tromboembolismo venoso deve ser feita de acordo com critérios clínicos, ou em situações como manutenção de altos níveis de dímero-D, em hipoxemia refratária ou em se detectando sinais de hipertensão pulmonar e de disfunção de ventrículo direito ao ecocardiograma.\n",
            " Em virtude do crescimento exponencial da disseminação do vírus, foi determinado que o distanciamento social é um fator-chave na diminuição da velocidade de transmissão por diminuir o contato pessoa a pessoa. Dessa maneira, torna-se indispensável o uso de tecnologia da informação como uma resposta de emergência às questões ambientais ou riscos biológicos presentes. A telessaúde permite a triagem remota, auxilia no diagnóstico de doenças e garante o acesso aos cuidados de rotina durante um surto de doença infecciosa. 65 Em 2019, o Conselho Federal de Medicina publicou um decreto que definiu a telemedicina como o exercício da medicina mediado por tecnologias para fins de assistência, educação, pesquisa, prevenção de doenças e lesões e promoção de saúde, regulamentando essa prática. A Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia publicou uma diretriz em telemedicina aplicada à cardiologia, também designada telecardiologia. A telecardiologia por meio de suas múltiplas ações na promoção da saúde, prevenção de doenças, diagnóstico, tratamento e reabilitação, com impacto na melhora da qualidade de vida, pode ser considerada uma importante aliada do sistema de saúde, seja ele público, suplementar ou privado, para promover atenção à saúde integral e com qualidade. A implementação da telecardiologia é importante tanto na atenção primária de saúde quanto na atenção especializada. 66 Na cardiologia, a telemedicina pode ser útil no controle dos fatores de risco como pressão arterial, diabetes mellitus, melhora do perfil lipídico, redução de peso e aumento do sucesso de programas de cessação do tabagismo. 66 No momento atual de controle da pandemia, a telemedicina torna-se uma ferramenta útil, especialmente para os pacientes de alto risco, diminuindo a exposição a contaminações pelo SARS-CoV-2 e auxiliando no controle das comorbidades.

            " The management of COVID-19 in Madrid Angel L opez-Encuentra, PhD a, *, Pablo L azaro y de Mercado, PhD b , Víctor Abraira, PhD c , Sergio García Rull, MD d The Commentary by Candel and colleagues [1] mentions that certain non-pharmacological interventions -perimeter closure of some Basic Health Areas (BHA), screening with rapid antigen tests in some BHAs, or sewage water testing in Madrid -have had a relevant impact on the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Community of Madrid (CM). However, the Candel's et al. Commentary does not provide specific outcomes data [1] . The CM has not increased its health care personnel, despite having fewer primary care physicians and nurses per million inhabitants than the national average (0.7 and 0.5 vs. 0.8 and 0.6, respectively) [2] , which severely limits the fundamental tasks for controlling the epidemic spread: tracing, testing, and isolation.\n",
            " The CM strategy, actually, translates into poor outcomes: 1) on 9 February 2021, the accumulated incidence at 14 days was 759.58 cases/100,000 inhabitants in the CM, vs. 630.00 in Spain [3] ; 2) the hospital beds occupancy was 25.62% vs. 20.41%; 3) the intensive care unit beds occupancy was 50.60% vs. 42.28%; and 4) the excess mortality was 31.3% (from 10 January 2021 to 2 February 2021) vs. 21.7% (from 4 January 2021 to 2 February 2021), respectively [4] . In addition, the estimated job growth for 2021 in the CM is 1.7% vs. 1.9% in Spain, and for gross domestic product, 4.7% vs. 5.5%, respectively [5] .\n",

            " Antiemetic agents pose an additional risk through the prolongations of QT intervals when medication is used concurrently with COVID-19 pharmacological therapies. 1 The fundamental understandings of the role of COVID-19 combination treatments in developing QT prolongation in hospitalised COVID-19 patients exhibiting nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal related complications remain unclear. Because adverse consequences are the attributes of a versatile range of causatives in the clinical nature of COVID-19, such as drugs, age, sex, or metabolic disorders (PH, hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities, and multi-organ system failure), previous cardiovascular disease, and viral or autoimmune myocardial injuries. 2 Additionally, antiemetics may even be more important in the field of emergency surgical patients with COVID 19 who might be treated more likely with open surgery and therefore more prone to nausea and vomiting. [3] [4] [5] We searched the consequential risks of prolonging QT intervals on the virtual shelves of scientific databases by courtesy of To surpass the pandemic, healthcare providers of varying specialties from doctors to nurses, and well-rounded clinical pharmacists have to come together and merge expertise because sharing the adversities, will save more patients' life.\n"

            " The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic and associated public health measures aiming to limit its transmission have had an unprecedented impact on healthcare services at all levels, including on routine childhood immunizations [1] [2] [3] . Multiple jurisdictions worldwide have reported significant declines in childhood vaccines administered and immunization coverage in the months following the pandemic declaration [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Disruptions to routine childhood immunization services leading to decreased coverage are concerning for possible resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), including measles [15] [16] [17] .\n",
            " In response to these concerns, international and Canadian public health and governmental institutions have recommended that routine immunizations are essential health services that should not be deferred, especially the primary series and booster doses for children aged less than two years [18] [19] [20] . Some studies have nonetheless reported on parents avoiding medical care facilities, clinics not providing in-person services due to the perceived risk of COVID-19 transmission, and school immunization programs being suspended [21, 22] . There is currently limited data to quantify the impact of the pandemic on pediatric immunization coverage in Canada, and whether the pandemic has impacted access to vaccination differentially for specific groups of children. The objective of this study was to compare the immunization coverage for children under two years old before and during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic by using primary care electronic medical records (EMR) data in the province of Ontario.\n",
            " We conducted an observational retrospective open cohort study using EMR data from family medicine practices included in the University of Toronto Practice-Based Research Network (UTOPIAN) to assess immunization coverage from January 2019 to December 2020.\n",
            " We used data from the UTOPIAN Data Safe Haven, which is a secure research database comprised of de-identified patient records extracted from EMRs of contributing family medicine practices associated with the University of Toronto, with more than 70% of these family physicians practicing in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in Ontario [23] . From the UTOPIAN database, we extracted the sociodemographic characteristics (date of birth, sex and postal code) and immunization records (name of vaccine and date given) of the children included in the study population. Measures of socioeconomic status (SES) and marginalization based on neighborhood income, material deprivation and ethnic concentration quintiles were derived based on the children's postal code using the Statistics Canada Postal Code Conversion File [24] [25] [26] .\n",
            " We created an open cohort of children using the following eligibility criteria: 1) were aged 0-2 years old during the study period, 2) had a valid sex and date of birth recorded in their EMR, 3) had at least two visits recorded in their EMR during the study period, with at least one visit after the second week of life to ensure continuity of care.\n",
            " Ontario is Canada's most populous province, with nearly 40% of the country's population [27] .\n",
            " Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Ontario declared a state of emergency on March 17, 2020 and entered its first \"lockdown\" [28] . As the first wave of the pandemic improved, restrictions were progressively lifted throughout the province with Toronto being one of the last regions to enter the final stage of reopening on July 31, 2020 [29] . Ontario experienced a second wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths from September 2020 to February 2021 [30] . At the end of the study period, Ontario had experienced the second highest number of COVID-19 cases and number of deaths in Canada [31] . Within the province, 30% of all cases have been detected in Toronto and the GTA [30] .\n",
            " In Ontario, immunizations for children under two years old are usually administered by primary care providers, including family physicians, during regular well-baby visits [22, 32] and documented in the children's medical record. EMR data from family physicians' clinics has been previously used and validated to study childhood immunization coverage in Ontario [32] [33] [34] .\n",
            " Ontario's Publicly Funded Immunization Schedule [35] recommends six different vaccines in the first 24 months of life (Table 1) [36] .\n",
            " Our study had two primary outcome measures: up-to-date (UTD) immunization coverage and ontime immunization coverage. UTD immunization refers to receiving all recommended vaccines by a certain age or by a specific point in time [37, 38] . On-time immunization refers to receiving the recommended vaccines for a specific age milestone within a 30-day leeway period after the due date [37, 38] . For example, a 12-month-old child should receive PCV13, Men-C-C and MMR vaccines within 30 days after the recommended age to be considered on-time and should have received all doses of recommended vaccines since birth to be considered UTD (Table 1 ).\n",
            " The study population's sociodemographic characteristics were summarized using frequencies and We calculated weekly (Sunday to Saturday) coverage rates from January 6, 2019 to December 20, 2020, which were the start of the first and last full weeks in 2019 and 2020 respectively. We used linear regression models to compare the average immunization coverage rates over three periods of time: baseline/pre-pandemic period, from January 6, 2019 to March 14, 2020 (T1); early pandemic period during the first wave/lockdown in Ontario, from March 15 to August 1, 2020 (T2); and later pandemic period during the reopening phase after first wave and beginning of second wave, from August 2 to December 26, 2020 (T3). We also examined if the differences in on-time immunization coverage rates over the three time periods were associated with any sociodemographic characteristics by fitting adjusted regression models. Each of these models included time period (to calculate the adjusted difference in immunization rates between time periods), one sociodemographic characteristic (to calculate the baseline difference in immunization rates for each level of the characteristic) and the interaction between time period and the sociodemographic characteristic (to calculate difference in differences). We also computed likelihood ratio statistics to assess the contribution of the interaction term to the regression model.\n",
            " Analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1 and SAS 9.4.\n",
            " The study was approved by the University Health Network (#20-6177) and the University of Toronto Health Sciences Research Ethics Boards (#40300).\n",
            " A total of 12,313 children aged 0 to 2 years old were included in our study population. The majority of children lived in an urban region (87.2%) and in a neighborhood of the most ethnically diverse quintile (33.4%). They were otherwise almost equally distributed across birth year, sex, neighborhood income and material deprivation quintiles (Table 2) . They had a median of 9 (interquartile range: 6-13) visits with their family physician during the study period, which corresponds to the number of recommended routine care visits for young children [39] . \n",
            " The baseline T1 average on-time immunization coverage rates were the highest for younger \n",
            " In this retrospective study using EMR data from a network of family medicine clinics in the GTA, Ontario, we found that routine childhood immunization coverage rates in children under 2 years old decreased significantly in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in children aged 15 and 18-months old. The coverage rates recovered in the second half of 2020 but remained lower overall compared to pre-pandemic rates. Our study provides more insight on which groups of children should be prioritized for immunization catch-up strategies and for targeted interventions to prevent immunization delays in future pandemic waves or other events that could be disruptive to the primary immunization schedule.\n",
            " Similar to reports from other countries, we found that the impact of the pandemic and stay-at-home orders on immunization coverage rates was the most significant in the early period of the pandemic and only partially recovered subsequently [9-11, 14, 40] . Some of this recovery may have been prompted by public messaging from official organizations that routine childhood immunization is an essential health service [9, 10] . In May 2020, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended prioritizing primary immunization series up to 18-months old during the pandemic [20] , which may have encouraged the increase in coverage rates seen in our results starting in June 2020. However, given lower rates persisted until the end of our observation period in December 2020, more education and support should be put forward for healthcare providers and parents [21] .\n",
            " Our finding that older (15-and 18-month-old) children have experienced a more significant drop in immunization coverage than younger children in the early pandemic period has been noted in other parts of the world [9] [10] [11] . Our study also found that the baseline on-time immunization coverage rate fell from around 88% for 2-month-old children to 51% at 18-months old. A similar trend was reported in the United States where the baseline vaccination coverage rate decreased from around 90% for 1-month-old children to 70% at 16-months old [11] . As children age, it is possible that there are more delays in attending routine visits as parents go back to working fulltime [41] . Additionally, there may be less perceived infectious risks for older children, especially if staying home during lockdown, which may explain why we found that the varicella vaccine The MMR vaccine coverage is an often-studied outcome as measles is a highly transmissible VPD.\n",
            " Substantial drops in MMR vaccine coverage and administration in children have been observed in the early pandemic period in several countries [10, 11, 42] . In our study, we found that MMR vaccine UTD coverage for children under two dropped only by 1.7% in the early pandemic period and remained at the same reduced level during the rest of 2020. However, even small (2-5%) reductions in measles vaccination coverage have been projected to result in exponential increase in measles outbreak size [43] . Close monitoring of new cases of measles and other VPDs will therefore be important as lockdown measures and travel restrictions are lifted due to the potential risk of imported cases.\n",
            " In the United States, vaccine administrations plummeted across all racial and ethnic groups during the initial lockdown period, but recovery was lower in non-Hispanic Black children than in other groups during the reopening period [11] . In our study, we did not have patient-level ethnicity information, but we stratified our analyses by neighborhood ethnic concentration quintiles, in addition to income and material deprivation quintiles. Although the decrease in on-time coverage rates during the pandemic was found to be similar across all socioeconomic subgroups in our study, there was a significant difference in the baseline on-time coverage rates, with children from the lowest income, the most materially deprived and the most ethnically diverse quintiles having the lowest immunization coverage rates. These neighborhood quintiles have been associated with higher levels of marginalization and to health inequities in other studies [25] . Public health interventions and catch-up immunization programs should be preferentially implemented in these low income and ethnically diverse neighborhoods to provide equitable access to immunization services and improve coverage gaps [44, 45] .\n",
            " As COVID-19 number of cases and deaths continued to surge in subsequent waves and as vaccines against COVID-19 have been rolled out in Ontario in 2021, further studies are needed to trend the impact on childhood immunization coverage rates during 2021. Additional studies are also needed to better understand immunization coverage discrepancies between certain neighborhoods and potential association with other individual-, family-and health system-level factors, and to quantify the impact of the pandemic on other immunizations, such as school-based immunization programs.\n",
            " The UTOPIAN data is limited to patients living mostly in the GTA, where there was a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, so our results may not be generalizable to other settings with lower COVID-19 incidence. Additionally, the patients in our study had access to family physicians working in clinical practices affiliated with the University of Toronto that likely had access to personal protective equipment and remained open to in-person appointments during the pandemic.\n",
            " Our results may therefore not be generalizable to children with limited access to primary care/family physicians, as these children may have experienced additional barriers to immunization services during the pandemic. The use of EMR data may lead to children being misclassified as not up-to-date or on-time in their immunizations if children received vaccines outside of their primary care practices or if their records are not adequately updated, which may have limited our analyses and led to an under-estimation of immunization coverage. However, primary care EMR data has been evaluated and shown to be a reliable source for childhood immunization coverage analyses in Ontario [33, 34, 38] as immunization services are mainly given in primary care clinics for infants and pre-school children. We still aimed to mitigate the possible impact of missing immunization records by only including patients with at least two visits with UTOPIAN family physicians to ensure continuity of care and exclude children who only saw the UTOPIAN-contributing family physician once (eg. walk-in visit, newborn visit, etc.) and\n",
            " completed their well-baby visits elsewhere.\n",
            " Our study found that childhood immunization coverage rates for children under 2 in Ontario, Canada were significantly decreased during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic and only partially recovered during the rest of 2020. Implementation of public health and primary care interventions for providers and parents are needed to ensure adequate catch-up of delayed/missed immunizations to prevent potential outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases as these children enter daycare/kindergarten, especially in certain age and socioeconomic groups where baseline immunization coverage gaps have been identified.\n",

Briefly, SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody (bAb) levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific to S-2P (collaborative development with PPD laboratories, Richmond, VA, USA). Interpolation from an 11-point dilution of a commercial anti-S-2P monoclonal antibody (clone CR3022, Rockland, Inc, Limerick, PA, USA) was used to determine the serum-derived anti-S-2P antibody concentration (AU/mL). Serum neutralising antibody (nAb) titres against SARS-CoV-2 were measured using a live virus microneutralisation (MN) assay based on an in situ ELISA readout. The assay was conducted in accordance with Battelle laboratory protocols and qualified critical reagents (Columbus, Ohio, TAK919/mRNA-1273 manuscript Vaccine 8 USA). The 50% MN titre (MN 50 ) was reported for each sample. While the assays were qualified in the previous study [9] , both bAb and nAb assays were fully validated at initiation for this study.\n",
            " In the present study, the primary safety outcome measures were: solicited AEs through 7 days after each vaccination; unsolicited AEs through 28 days after each vaccination; MAAEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of vaccination and AEs leading to participant withdrawal from the trial through day 57; and proportion of participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection through day 57.\n",
            " The primary immunogenicity outcome measure was serum bAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 on day 57. The key secondary immunogenicity outcome measures were serum bAb levels and serum nAb titres against SARS-CoV-2 throughout the follow-up period (except for serum bAb level on day 57, which was the primary outcome measure). Only data to day 57 are available to date.\n",
            " The trial planned to enrol 200 participants, 150 in the mRNA-1273 arm and 50 in the placebo arm. No formal statistical power calculations were performed to determine the sample size. The sample size for the trial was considered sufficient with a 95% probability of observing at least one AE with a 2% event rate in the mRNA-1273 arm. The interim analysis was performed for safety and immunogenicity after all participants had completed the day 57 visit (data cut-off date: 31 March 2021). The full analysis set (FAS) and safety analysis set (SAS) each included all randomised participants who received at least one treatment dose, and the per protocol set (PPS) included participants in the FAS who received two treatment doses, had evaluable TAK919/mRNA-1273 manuscript Vaccine immunogenicity data and had no significant protocol deviations. All safety summaries were presented by treatment group based on the SAS, and unsolicited AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities dictionary version 24.0. For the immunogenicity endpoints, geometric mean titre (GMT), geometric mean fold rises (GMFR), and seroconversion rate (SCR; defined as percentage of participants with a change from below the lower limit of quantification [LLOQ, 1.0 AU/mL for bAb and 159.79 for nAb] to equal to or above LLOQ, or a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline), and their respective 95% CIs were analysed in the PPS. Antibody values reported as below LLOQ were replaced by 0.5 × LLOQ. Values that were greater than the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ; 2052 AU/mL for bAb and 11173.11 for nAb) were replaced by the ULOQ. Sub-analyses by age groups (≥20 years to <65 years or ≥65 years) and sex (male or female) were performed for solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs and immunogenicity analyses. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4.\n",
            " A total of 319 participants were screened between 21 January 2021 and 3 February 2021 and 200 participants were randomised (150 participants in the mRNA-1273 arm and 50 participants in the placebo arm; Figure 2 ). In the mRNA-1273 arm, 147/150 (98.0%) participants received both doses of vaccine. Three participants (2.0%) did not receive a second vaccination in the mRNA-1273 arm due to adverse events (injection-site rash in two participants; injection-site pain, fatigue, arthralgia, headache and axillary pain in 1 participant). Despite not receiving their second vaccinations, the three participants in the mRNA-1273 arm agreed to continue with safety assessments during the follow-up period. All participants received both vaccinations in the placebo arm and no participants discontinued from the study by 31 March 2021, the data cut-off date for this interim analysis. All 200 participants were included in the SAS and FAS; and TAK919/mRNA-1273 manuscript Vaccine 50 (98.0%) participants from the placebo arm. In total, 4 participants were excluded from the PPS: 3 in the mRNA-1273 arm because they did not receive a second vaccination and 1 in the placebo arm because their day 57 visit could not be completed by the data cut-off date.\n",
            " The baseline characteristics were generally balanced across the mRNA-1273 and placebo arms and in each age group ( Solicited local and systemic AEs through day 7 were mainly mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) in severity in both arms after the first and second injections ( Figure 3A; Table 2 ). In the mRNA-1273 arm, the incidence of grade 2 or 3 solicited AEs increased after the second injection, particularly for systemic AEs. After the second vaccination, the incidence of grade 3 or In the mRNA-1273 arm, injection-site pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE after both the first and second vaccination and in both age groups (≥20 years to <65 years, after the second vaccination in the mRNA-1273 arm in both age groups (Figure 3) .\n",
            " Unsolicited AEs were reported in 45/150 (30.0%) participants who received mRNA-1273 and 11/50 (22.0%) participants who received placebo ( Table 3) MAAEs were reported in 7/150 (4.7%) participants who received mRNA-1273 and in 1/50 (2.0%) of participants who received placebo. The only MAAE reported by ≥2 participants in the mRNA-1273 arm was dental caries. No noteworthy differences by age group (≥20 to <65 years or ≥65 years) were observed in the unsolicited AE profile across the arms. No deaths, SAEs or AEs leading to a participant's withdrawal from study occurred in the 28 days after any injections.\n",
            " AEs leading to discontinuation from vaccination were reported in 3 participants in the mRNA-1273 arm. No SARS-CoV-2-infected participants were reported through to the data cut-off date.\n",
            " There were no clinically meaningful changes in safety clinical laboratory tests in either groups.\n",
            " In the mRNA-1273 arm, alanine aminotransferase increased, and aspartate aminotransferase increased were reported in 1 participant each (0.7%) as unsolicited AEs. These events were grade 1 in severity, resolved, and were considered to be unrelated to treatment (data not shown).\n",
            " Two doses of 100 μg mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart resulted in the induction of bAb for S-2P in all 147 (100%) participants from baseline by day 57, in the primary immunogenicity analysis.\n",
            " No such induction of bAb was observed in the placebo group ( For SCR, defined as percentage of participants with a change from below the LLOQ to equal to or above LLOQ, or a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline the placebo arm showed a 2.0% (95% CI: 0.1, 10.9) SCR on day 57 (Table 4) \n",
            " This was the first phase 1/2 study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in healthy Japanese adults aged 20 years or older. Two doses of 100 μg mRNA-1273 administered 28 days apart exhibited robust immune responses and an acceptable safety profile that was in line with US phase 2 and 3 mRNA-1273 studies [5, 6] . Based on the data from the present study and the US data, mRNA-1273 was approved for emergency use in Japan in May 2021 [11] .\n",
            " Local and systemic adverse events were predominantly grade 1-2 in severity, generally resolved within three days, and occurred at a similar incidence irrespective of age. While we must be careful in our assessment due to the difference in sample size between the studies, the incidence rate of some solicited AEs including grade 3 and grade 4 fever tended to be higher in this phase 1/2 study in a Japanese population compared with the phase 3 study in the USA.\n",
            " The incidence rates of any grade, grade 3 and grade 4 fever post second vaccination were 40.1% (59/147 participants), 4.8% (7/147 participants), and 0.7% (1/147 participants) in the present study versus 17.4% (1806/10352 participants), 1.6% (168/10352 participants), and <0.1% (10/10352 participants) in the US phase 3 study [5, 14] . However, the majority of solicited AEs in the mRNA-1273 group were grade 1-2 in severity and generally resolved within a few days in both studies. The difference in incidence rate of solicited AEs might be due to the same vaccine dose being administered to participants in Japan and US irrespective of mean body mass, which was higher among the US participants [15] . In the present study, mean body mass index was 22.39 (±2.65) kg/m 2 in the mRNA-1273 arm whereas in the US study participants had a mean body mass index of 29.3 (±6.9) kg/m 2 [5] . No specific concerns for the Japanese population were raised with regard to the unsolicited AEs identified. Hence, there was no clinically significant difference in safety profile between the Japanese phase 1/2 and US phase 3 study.\n",
            " Delayed-onset local reactions (defined as those with an onset on or after day 8) after either the first or second dose of mRNA-1273 were reported in both the US phase 3 study (rate after first dose, 0.8% [244/30,420 participants]; rate after second dose 0.2% [68/30,420 participants]) and in a subsequent case series [5, 16] . In the present study, we observed 8 relevant cases as described in the results, all of which were grade 1-2 in severity and resolved within the follow-up periods. The exact mechanism underlying delayed-onset local reactions is not known; however, delayed-type or T-cell mediated hypersensitivity is hypothesised [16] . Although such delayed reactions may be worrisome for people receiving the vaccine, neither delayed hypersensitivity reaction nor local injection-site reactions are considered contraindications to future doses [17] , and administration of the second vaccine dose is considered prudent given the robust acquired immune response we observed post-second dose.\n",
            " In the present study, Japanese adults who received two doses of 100 μg of mRNA-1273 given 28 days apart induced robust immune response for both binding and neutralising antibodies against the recombinant S-2P protein or wild-type virus by day 57, with GMFRs >1000-fold (bAb) and >20-fold (nAb) respectively. In the present study, anti-S-2P bAb and nAb were produced in response to both doses of mRNA-1273 within 28 days (day 29) after the first vaccination, rising to peak titres by 14 days after the second vaccination (day 43) and then remaining elevated to day 57. SCR was 100% at day 57. A similar response pattern and time course was reported in a phase 2 study of mRNA-1273 conducted in healthy adults in the USA [6] .\n",
            " While vaccine efficacy (prevention of symptomatic virus infection) was not investigated in the present study, the immunogenicity findings and response patterns observed were similar to those observed in the phase 2 [6] and phase 3 (unpublished data) US studies, so we would anticipate that mRNA-1273 would achieve similar vaccine efficacy in Japanese populations. In a phase 3 US study of 30,420 volunteers of whom 2.2% had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (serologic or virologic, or both) at baseline, mRNA-1273 (100 μg) vaccine efficacy was shown to be 94.1% (95% CI: 89.3, 96.8; P<0.001) [5] . These findings further support the use of mRNA-1273 in the Japanese population.\n",
            " Nevertheless, given the continued evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is vital that further research is conducted to assess the efficacy of 100 μg mRNA-1273 against variants [18, 19] , and to examine safety and efficacy in paediatric populations. We acknowledge several limitations of our study. Because of the precautionary nature of phase 1/2 studies, our study was restricted by its small sample size and the efficacy of the vaccine as prophylaxis for COVID-19 was not assessed. Moreover, the study included only healthy adult participants aged ≥20 years so caution should be used when extrapolating results to populations with comorbid diseases that impact immune response, or in paediatric populations. Percentages are based on the number of randomised participants. Table 2 . Solicited adverse events within 7 days after injections (safety analysis set). Tables   Table 3 .

            "Body Text:\n",
            " about 100% [1] . Despite the presence of post-exposure prophylaxis, rabies infection resulted in approximately 59,000 deaths worldwide each year with the majority of cases in Africa and Asia. That's one person dies every 9 minutes due to rabies infection every day, 40% of whom are mostly children [2] . It causes severe economic loss in many developing countries approaching 5.5 billion dollars per year. Rabies infection is accompanied by acute encephalomyelitis that progresses rapidly to coma or death within days after the onset of symptoms [3] . Even though the international efforts to produce an effective rabies vaccine, the disease has not been eliminated as it has many animal reservoirs [4] . There is always an attempt to formulate an affordable and safe rabies vaccine via the use of inactivated rabies virus [5] . β-propiolactone (βPL) is the currently recommended inactivating agent for rabies virus, where it maintains the viral antigenicity compared to other chemicals, such as formaldehyde and phenol [6] . However, βPL is a potentially carcinogenic and expensive inactivant, thus it is important to find other inactivating agents which are safe, cheap, and available [7] .\n",
            " Although the mass production of cell culture based inactivated rabies vaccines is costly, but it is mostly used worldwide [8] . Additionally, there is always a need to improve the immune-enhancing potentials of the prepared cell culturebased rabies vaccines in developing countries via the use of adjuvants such as alum [9] . In alum adjuvanted vaccines the antigen becomes readily absorbed by the subject and more immunogenic [10] . On the other side, searching for an alternative adjuvant to alum is an essential issue in order to overcome its well-known side effects [9] . Attention has now been directed to the enhancement of immunogenicity of viral vaccines via the development of bio-adhesive delivery systems using natural constituents, such as lectins and fimbrial proteins. These bio-adhesives attach to mucosal cell surfaces through receptor-mediated mechanisms. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an example of these natural bio-adhesives which has the potential in developing an effective immune response. It was found that the combination of the antigen with either esterified HA polymers or auto-cross-linked HA polymers resulted in significant improvement in the immune response [11] . Among other immunostimulants, it was also demonstrated that bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated tuberculosis vaccine that has the potential to stimulate non-specific cross-protection against different pathogens as it improves the antigen recognition and induces rapid inflammatory response [12] . Consequently, the current study aimed to evaluate the inactivation potential of βPL, binary ethyleneimine (BEI), and H2O2. Monitoring the humoral and cellular immune response elicited post-vaccination using Staphylococcus aureus derived HA and BCG purified protein derivative (PPD) adjuvanted rabies vaccines. In addition to assessment of histopathological changes associated with the administration of these vaccines in laboratory animals.\n",
            " All procedures involving animals followed the regulations approved by the Egyptian Network of Research Ethics Committee which was created in 2008. An ethical approval for the present study protocol was granted by the Holding Company for Biological Products and Vaccines, Sera, and Drugs (VAC-SERA) ethical committee, Cairo, Egypt (approval no., 0728019157). The scarified and dead animals were decanted according to the safety and occupational health guidelines. The study sticked to the National Institute of Health (NIH) regulations regarding the animal care and the use program of laboratory animals. There are no human subjects in this study and informed consent is unapplicable.\n",
            " Five suckling mice families and 20 adult mice were used for evaluation of the safety profiles of the prepared vaccines. Five groups of 16 adult Swiss albino male mice of 4-6 weeks old (14-16 g) were used for testing the potency of each vaccine. Three groups of 120-150 g Sprague Dawley rats (10 rats/ group) were immunized according to a predetermined schedule to estimate the level of the developed immune response.\n",
            " Fixed rabies virus (FRV/K2) was kindly supplied by el-Karamany [13] (former general manager of research and development sector), the VACSERA, Egypt. Rabies virus was adapted to Vero cells (ATCC [American Type Culture Collection] CCL-81) by alternating 37 passages in mice and Vero cells (20 cycles in mice and 17 passages in Vero cells). The adapted viral strain was used to prepare the test vaccine and recorded a viral titer of 7.5 log10 MICLD50 (mouse intracerebral lethal dose 50%)/mL.\n",
            " Binary ethylene amine and hydrogen peroxide were kindly supplied from Sigma-Aldrich (Burlington, MA, USA). ethylene amine was converted into BEI using 0.2 N NaOH and finally used as 0.001 M. H2O2 was used as 0.3 M, whereas βPL was used at a final concentration of 0.0035 M.\n",
            " Rat anti-rabies immunoglobulin G (IgG) was kindly supplied from VACSERA and it was used as 6.5 IU/mL.\n",
            " Rabies vaccine was prepared using Vero cells, where exhausted growth medium was decanted from tissue culture flasks and rabies virus was inoculated at one multiplicity of infection/mL. Flasks were incubated at 37°C (Jouan, Saint-Herblain, France) for 1-1.5 hours and shaken at 15-minute intervals to ensure the even distribution of the virus on the cultured area. Maintenance medium was added to the infected flasks and cells were examined daily for detection of morphological changes using inverted microscope (Helmut Hund GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). On the third day, the infection medium was harvested and replaced with fresh medium. Medium containing cell free virus was harvested at 4-5 days interval. On the 15th-20th day, the cell associated virus was also collected through 3 cycles of freezing and thawing and cold centrifuged (Jouan). Cell pellets were decanted. The infectivity titer of the pooled viral harvests (cell free and cell associated virus) was evaluated using mice inoculation assay. Viral suspension was concentrated by the aid of hollow fiber cartridge ultra-filtration system [9] .\n",
            " The previously prepared bulk virus was divided into three aliquots. Chemical inactivants such as βPL, BEI, and H2O2 were added to each bulk at a final concentration of 0.0035 M for βPL, 0.001M for BEI, and 0.3 M for H2O2. Treated viral bulks were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours and samples were collected for evaluation of the inactivation kinetics according to the designed protocol. Samples were collected at predetermined time interval and were 10-fold serially diluted in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Each dilution (0.03 mL/ mouse) was inoculated intracerebrally in Swiss albino male mice of 15-17 g body weight (6 mice/dilution). Mice mortality was recorded for 14 days post-injection keeping in consideration that the number of deaths was recorded starting from the 5th day post-inoculation. The viral infectivity titer was determined according to Reed and Muench [14] in 1938. The presence of residual living virus was traced via intracerebrally injecting the inactivated virus in 5 suckling mice families and 20 adult mice. The vaccine was considered safe on condition that all inoculated mice remained alive for a period of 28 days post-intracerebral inoculation [6] .\n",
            " S. aureus derived HA and PPD of BCG were kindly supplied from VACSERA. PPD was routinely produced in BCG department (Tuberculin PPD RT23 \"SSI\"), batch no. A25/2020 and its release was based on certified quality control procedures. While HA was not a routine production line, but it was prepared as the research and development sector's self-activity and its purity was examined using gel electrophoresis to detected clear sole bands with an average molecular weight of about 700 kDa. Both adjuvants were mixed with the prepared vaccines at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL and incubated over night at 4°C.\n",
            " Prepared vaccine candidates were 5-fold serially diluted in phosphate buffer saline. Each dilution (0.3 mL) was intraperitoneally (IP) injected into 16 adult Swiss albino male mice of 4-6 weeks old and weighing 14-16 g. Injection was carried out at zero time and a second dose was administered on the 7th day post-prime vaccination. On the 14th day, vaccinated mice were challenged intracerebrally using 50 LD50 (lethal dose 50%) of challenge virus standard kindly supplied from rabies vaccine research unit, VACSERA. Mortality was recorded starting from the 5th to the 15th day post-challenge. ED50 (the effective dose that protects 50% of challenged mice) of test vaccines was determined according to the NIH protocol [15] .\n",
            " Three groups of 120-150 g body weight Sprague Dawley strain of albino rats (10 rats/each) were immunized via IP injection of five doses of adjuvanted test vaccines at days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Blood samples were collected from the retro orbital plexus of the vaccinated rats at predetermined time intervals and incubated at 37°C till complete coagulation. Clotted blood samples were cold centrifuged (Jouan) to separate immune sera and stored at -80°C until use. Evaluation of humoral immunity was carried out via assessment of rabies antibody level in the collected sera using home reference enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Whereas, cellular immunity was traced based on evaluation of interferhttps://www.ecevr.org/ https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2021.10.3.229 on gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin type 5 (IL-5) levels according to the manufacturer's protocols (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA) [9] .\n",
            " Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue sections was carried out to detect histopathological changes occurring in adult male rats immunized with HA, PPD, and alum adjuvanted rabies vaccines compared to unadjuvanted vaccine. At the end of the immunization schedule (10 days after last dose), rats were sacrificed. The kidney and the liver were obtained from dissected animals and washed in normal saline followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin. Specimens were obtained from each of the dissected organs and washed with tap water followed by dehydration for 30 minutes suing serially diluted ethanol (50%, 60%, 70%, 85%, and 95%). Specimens were incubated in 1:1 mixture of ethanol and xylene for 30 minutes, washed twice using xylene for 1 hour and transferred to xylene and paraffin mixture for 30 minutes. Transverse sections (5 mm) were dewaxed at 60°C, immersed in xylene for 1 hour, rehydrated using a series of ethanol (95%, 80%, 70%, and 60%) for 2 minutes, and washed using tap water. Sections were stained using hematoxylin and eosin. Slides were mounted using Entellan embedding agent, covered with coverslips, and examined using a light microscope connected to a digital camera [16] .\n",
            " All experiments were performed in three independent tests. Data were presented as the mean±standard deviation and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Student ttest. The results were considered statistically significant at probability less than 0.05.\n",
            " Data recorded revealed that βPL and H2O2 showed faster inactivation potentials compared with that of BEI. The recorded mean depletion rate of rabies virus infectivity titer was in the order of 4.3, 3.2, and 2.5 log10/hr post-treatment with βPL, H2O2, and BEI, respectively. It was clear that the inactivation potential of βPL was significantly elevated (p<0.05) compared to that of H2O2 and BEI, where the virus was completely inactivated within 2 hours. Whereas, H2O2 and BEI completely inactivated the virus within 4 and 12 hours, respectively. In the meantime, no residual living virus was detected during the observation period (28 days) post-inoculation of the inactivated virus using the tested inactivants (Fig. 1 ).\n",
            " Regarding the inactivation efficacy and related vaccine potency, it was noticed that the prepared rabies vaccines using the tested inactivants were potent according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations; ED50 >2.5 IU/mL. There was non-significant difference (p>0.05) between the recorded ED50 (4.21±0.03 IU/mL) in case of BEI inactivated vaccine compared to that of βPL (3.75±0.06 IU/mL) and H2O2 (3.64±0.15 IU/mL) inactivated vaccine candidates. \n",
            " Evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity was based on the determination of the humoral immune response (total anti-rabies IgG) using direct ELISA compared with home reference serum (6.5 IU/mL). It was noticed that anti-rabies IgG was elevated relative to time and there was non-significant difference between the antibody levels in case of immunization with un adjuvanted BEI, βPL, and H2O2 inactivated vaccines (p>0.05) during the first 14 days. While on the 21st day postvaccination, BEI and H2O2 inactivated vaccines showed significantly arising antibody levels (p<0.05) compared to that detected post-vaccination with βPL inactivated vaccine ( Fig.  2A) . Regarding the immunogenicity of adjuvanted vaccines, it was noticed that the HA adjuvanted βPL and H2O2 inactivated vaccines showed a significantly (p<0.01) elevated antirabies IgG as compared to that detected post-vaccination with PPD adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccine candidates (Fig. 2B, C) . Similarly, HA adjuvanted BEI inactivated vaccine exhibited higher antibody level compared to PPD adjuvanted BEI inactivated vaccine (Fig. 2D ).\n",
            " Concerning the cellular immune response detected postvaccination with adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccine candidates, it was noticed that IFN-γ levels showed progressive elevated values relative to time. However, there was insignificant difference (p>0.05) in IFN-γ levels in the sera of the tested groups immunized using different adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidates until the 14th day post-immunization. Further detection of IFN-γ levels revealed significant elevated IFN-γ levels in case of immunization with BEI inactivated vaccine compared to βPL and H2O2 inactivated vaccines, where they showed almost plateau shape followed by a declining phase during the 28th-35th day post-vaccination ( Fig.  3A) . On the other hand, the use of HA as an adjuvant in case of BEI and H2O2 inactivated vaccines resulted in a significant (p<0.01) elevation in IFN-γ levels compared to PPD adjuvanted one followed by unadjuvanted vaccines (Fig. 3C, D) . IL-5 showed a successive elevation post-immunization with unadjuvanted vaccines till the peak was detected between the 14th and 21st day post-vaccination with βPL, BEI, and H2O2 inactivated vaccines followed by a declining phase dur- ing the 28th and 35th day in case of immunization with H2O2 inactivated vaccine. Higher IL-5 levels were detected postimmunization with unadjuvanted βPL and BEI inactivated vaccines compared to H2O2 inactivated one (Fig. 4A) . It was also observed that IL-5 levels in HA adjuvanted vaccines either βPL or BEI inactivated were significantly (p<0.01) higher than that in case of PPD adjuvanted as well as in unadjuvanted vaccines (Fig. 4B, C) .\n",
            " Hematoxylin and eosin-stained kidney sections of male rats post-immunization with HA and PPD adjuvanted rabies inactivated vaccine candidates showed that both HA and PPD adjuvanted vaccines showed almost normal kidney architecture as indicated by the normal appearance of glomerular space and renal tubules (Fig. 5C, D) in addition to normal liver cells and nuclei (Fig. 6B, C) . However, kidney sections in rats administered alum as standard adjuvant showed infiltrated glomerular space and renal tubules as well as increase of connective tissue (Fig. 5E, F) . Moreover, portal fibrosis, vacuolated cytoplasm, and cellular infiltration were apparent in hepatic sections of rats immunized with alum adjuvanted vaccine (Fig. 6D ).\n",
            " Rabies is a fatal viral infection transmitted through the bites of rabid animals. If not prevented, rabies virus attacks the cells of the central nervous system leading to death [17] . Rabies infection is considered one of the important causes of human mortality despite the presence of effective prophylactic measures. This may be due to that the achievement of successful post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies is encountered by some problems such as the cost as well as other factors related to vaccine potency during its formulation [18] . Thus, the current study aimed to estimate the inactivation potentials of βPL, BEI, and H2O2 as the inactivation of rabies virus is considered a critical factor in the production of rabies vaccine. It was observed that the inactivation kinetics of βPL was comparable to that of H2O2, while BEI showed somewhat a delayed inactivation potential (12 hours). βPL, H2O2, and BEI recorded a mean depletion rate of rabies virus infectivity titer in the order of 4.3, 3.2, and 2.5 log10/hr, respectively till complete inactivation. Also, the potency of test vaccines was in the accepted range according to WHO recommendations (>2.5 IU/mL) and nearly similar (WHO, 1996) . That was in agreement with another study, where it reported that H2O2 showed promising inactivation kinetics of rabies virus and the potency of H2O2 inactivated rabies vaccine was acceptable compared to that of βPL inactivated one. It was also reported that H2O2 is considered safe to the environment as it is decomposed to oxygen and water thus there is no need for complicated purification processes for its removal from the vaccine [19] . Contrary to our findings, another study pointed out that although βPL is a common inactivating agent but sometimes it failed to inactivate the virus completely. On the other hand, H2O2 retains its viral inactivation potential without causing destruction of the antigenic epitopes [10] . The present study also highlighted the effectiveness of BEI to inactivate rabies virus, where it completely inactivated the virus within 12 hours and the potency of the BEI inactivated vaccine was 4.2 IU/mL. In the same context, it was reported that BEI is an effective rabies virus inactivating agent that has an advantage over βPL, where BEI is more stable, inexpensive and could be easily prepared with less handling hazards. It was also found that although both βPL and BEI inactivate the virus through alkylation of the viral genome, BEI preserved the virus structure as it passes through the viral capsid and alkylates the viral genome. On the other side, modification of the viral proteins should be kept in mind when βPL is used as inactivating agent. Not only the ability of the inactivating agent to maintain the viral antigenicity is an essential goal during the preparation of viral inactivated vaccines, but also ensuring the absence of the residual living virus is another important point that should be taken into consideration [20] . Therefore, the current study proved the ability of the tested inactivants to completely inactivate rabies virus. The immune response developed following vaccination goes hand in hand with the inactivation kinetics and safety concerns of viral vaccines. The immunogenic potential of cell culture derived rabies vaccines is commonly evaluated via determining the humoral response as indicated by measuring rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer developed postimmunization. Additionally, the detection of cytokines such as IFN-γ and interleukin-5 levels following vaccination is a respectable marker for investigating the cell mediated immune response, where during viral infection the CD4 T cells differentiate into either type 1 cytokine producing Th1 cells or type 2 cytokine producing Th2 cells. Th1 cells play an essential role in anti-viral immunity, where they secrete type 1 panel of cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α. These cells also stimulate the interaction between CD8 T cells and dendritic cells and aid B cells to release high affinity neutralizing antibodies. Whereas, Th2 cells secrete type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and promote the humoral immune response of B cells as well as the immunopathology during viral infection [21] . Concerning the effectiveness of different inactivants to enhance eliciting significant immune response, the current findings demonstrated that elevated anti-rabies IgG and IFN-γ levels were recorded post-immunization with BEI-inactivated vaccines compared to βPL and H2O2 inactivated vaccines. That was in accordance with a study which reported that most of BEI-inactivated viruses could elicit a protective immune response due to the induction of significant levels of neutralizing antibodies [20] . Another study related the level of the developed immune response to the denaturation potential of the tested inactivant on the viral epitopes, where they examined the effect of different inactivants on the epitopes of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus glycoproteins. It was demonstrated that BEI exhibited very low adverse effect on RVF epitopes, whereas βPL significantly altered seven epitopes and the least number of intact epitopes was accompanied by the highest immune response [22] . Induction of remarkable level of immune response is also critically influenced by the formulation of the vaccine, where higher amount of the released antibodies as well as longer-lasting protection could be achieved via the incorporation of an adjuvant during vaccine preparation [23] . Despite that alum is the first used adjuvant in licensed human vaccines, it has some disadvantages due to its carcinogenicity, exaggerated stimulatory effect in localized area and its inability to elicit an immune response of a weak antigen [24] . In the present study we explored the application of new adjuvants of different bacterial origins to compare their potentials to reach optimum and safe immune response against rabies infection. Regarding the recorded effectiveness of S. aureus derived adjuvants as an immunostimulant in rabies vaccine, it was reported that staphylococcus derived enterotoxin C2 could be applied as a successful adjuvant for rabies vaccine. This study demonstrated that mice immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 adjuvanted rabies vaccine exhibited elevated levels of anti-rabies IgG as well as IFN-γ and IL-4 producing cells as compared to unadjuvanted vaccine [25] . HA is a type of carbohydrate-based vehicle that attracted the attention of researchers to be studied as adjuvant and delivery system due to its immune modulating properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability as well as its low toxicity [26] .\n",
            " A study demonstrated that HA-coated nanoparticles could enhance the activation and maturation of dendritic cells. In addition to promoting the release of co-stimulatory molecules, they enhance antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, cytokines, antigen-specific IgG antibody, and the generation of memory T-cells. The use of cationic liposome-HA hybrid nanoparticles as potential vaccine delivery system for intranasal vaccination with subunit antigens was also demonstrated [27] in addition to the successful application of HA as nanocarriers in non-invasive transdermal vaccination [28] . The immune enhancing potential of HA is attributed to its ability to deliver the antigens to desired body sites [27] . It was also reported that the HA polymers reduce the antigen clearance rate which subsequently extended the contact time between the antigen and the absorbing membrane. Moreover, an effective antigen transport occurs via HA induced widening at the tight cellular junctions [11] . Similarly, it was found that the co-delivery of BCG as an adjuvant in DNA vaccines resulted in an enhancement of the immune response in terms of the released immunoglobulins as well as the cellmediated immunity [29] . Although the immune response developed post-immunization with adjuvanted vaccine is greater than that obtained in case of unadjuvanted one, the absolute safety of adjuvanted vaccines can't be guaranteed. The major problems caused by administration of adjuvanted vaccines are the occurrence of inflammation, abscess or nodules at the injection site as well as fever and hypersensitivity in addition to other consequences due to the adjuvant's toxicity to tissues or organs [30] . Thus, the present study investigated the histopathological changes developed post-immunization with the newly adjuvanted rabies vaccines (namely HA and PPD) compared to the currently used alum as a standard adjuvant as well as the unadjuvanted vaccine. The currently tested adjuvants were used at the lowest concentration (10 µg/mL) that could be applied to avoid any exaggerated inflammatory reactions induced in response to the administration of these adjuvants [31] . In coincidence with our findings, it was demonstrated that alum showed necrotic muscle fibers and granulomas at https://www.ecevr.org/ the injection site [32] . In addition, severe histological changes were observed post-administration of alum adjuvanted tetanus toxoid vaccine, where the kidney cells of the vaccinated mice showed mononuclear cellular infiltration, renal tubule vacuolation as well as congestion of peritubular capillaries [33] . On the contrary, the observed histopathological changes encountered with HA and PPD adjuvanted rabies vaccines were much lower than that in case of alum adjuvanted one. That may suggest lower adverse effects associated with the administration of these types of newly promising adjuvanted vaccines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report comparing the inactivation potentials of βPL, BEI, and H2O2 on rabies virus and demonstrating the immune potentials of HA and PPD as adjuvants in the preparation of rabies vaccine. The vaccines developed during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (especially the Chinese βPL inactivated-alum adjuvanted vaccine against COVID-19) is a strong reminder for the evolving need for developing an efficient and safe whole-virus-inactivated vaccine to target several viral antigens using different inactivating agents and adjuvants [34] . Despite that the present study was carried out on rabies virus not on coronavirus, the current findings might draw attention to BEI and H2O2 as potential immunogenic viral inactivating agents alternative to βPL. Simultaneously, exploring the efficiencies of new adjuvants (such as HA and BCG derived PPD) either for enhanced immune response or for lower adverse effects should be addressed.\n",
            " In conclusion, finally, it is worth to point out that hydrogen peroxide could be applied as rabies virus inactivating agent without adversely affecting its immunogenic potentials. Additionally, the application of HA and BCG derived PPD as adjuvants could enhance the elicited humoral as well as the cell mediated immune response with lower adverse effects. However, more intensified studies regarding the application of these bacterial derived proteins as adjuvants should be conducted in comparison to the standard adjuvants such as alum with an investigation of the cellular immune reactivity to draw a whole picture for their role as adjuvants and related pathways affecting the immune system.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Since initial discussions of technological interventions for COVID-19 in early 2020, we have had the opportunity to see technology such as exposure notifications implemented in the real world, leading to learnings about the role of technology in supporting an equitable, privacy-preserving, and successful pandemic response. One major outcome of these learnings has been a deeper understanding of the ways our technical interventions should be aligned with and in service of broader social outcomes, through partnering with existing institutions, communities, and organizations. A second major lesson is the need to ensure accessibility and transparency to the public to build trust, and determine when (and if) technological solutions are best suited for the task at hand. These insights and additional context should be applied in disentangling the recent surge of interest in COVID vaccine credentials.\n",
            " While the idea of vaccine credentials is not new, the present context introduces new and pressing concerns about potential negative effects of this technology being rushed into deployment in response to COVID. Proactive use of intentionally designed technology towards the purpose of vaccine credentialing could potentially result in a faster and safer return to work, travel, and other aspects of daily life, and thus is well worth investigating. However, any use of credentialing technology must protect individual rights and safety, and also not exacerbate the very real community-and economic-based divides that have already emerged throughout the pandemic.\n",
            " Thus, as we consider how and whether to develop this technology, it is crucial to do so in a manner aligned with a deep understanding of inherent tradeoffs and complexities. In this paper, we aim to share our thinking as researchers in this space, with a range of firsthand experience, both through involvement in early policysetting regarding exposure notifications, as well as via years of navigating many of the complexities and concerns that emerge with proposed short-term technical interventions in large-scale societal problems. Our hope is that our experience may guide others' explorations, particularly technologists; our aim is not to adjudicate whether these systems should be developed, but rather to understand possible ethical and implementation concerns, and point the way forward to a robust and effective ecosystem. For communicative clarity, the paper is structured as a deep dive into each of our proposed guiding principles.\n",
            " A successful end-to-end credentialing system allows a range of institutions to verify vaccination certificates that have been issued by a health authority, and are held by the vaccinated individual in question. Issuers are typically institutions such as hospitals, pharmacies, or other entities with the authority to administer vaccinations and accompanying documentation. The holder is the individual who holds the credential with their own vaccination information and can choose to present it for verification to an entity such as an airline or school that might be interested in confirming vaccination status. There have been several proposed paradigms for interactions between these parties.\n",
            " Currently widely adopted mechanisms to exchange claims about the end-user require issuers and verifiers of credentials to have a pre-established trust relationship (potentially through an intermediary organization). However, this is unlikely to be effective for vaccine credentials, given that they are expected to be used globally and across contexts in which pre-established trust or relevant intermediaries may not exist. For example, an issuing hospital in Japan cannot be expected to have pre-established trust relationships with all potential verifiers in the US -airports, restaurants, hotels, etc. Thus, the usage of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) has emerged as a promising technology. VCs enable cryptographic verification of the authenticity of the presented proof and can be exchanged relying on ad hoc trust established per transaction, allowing for use across contexts, jurisdictions, and timelines.\n",
            " For vaccination credentials to be used worldwide, enabling technologies and trust frameworks must have some degree of interoperability. Defining the common set of requirements for the exchange of vaccination credentials has proven to be a challenge, with various stakeholder groups defining their own requirements. In laying out the below principles, we articulate a set of further recommendations towards the architecture and sociotechnical deployment of vaccine credentials.\n",
            " There are a range of potential harms from vaccine credentials that could be precipitated by a rushed implementation, especially for groups that are already marginal-ized. It is critical that focus stays on ensuring access to vaccines and proof of vaccination to all, so that groups most at risk from COVID for health and economic reasons are not gated on willingness or ability to use a specific credential technology. It is not possible to have an equitable implementation of vaccine credentials without equitable access to vaccines.\n",
            " A clear plan for educating the public on these credentials, their scope and privacy guarantees, and the basics of their use, should be developed concurrently with the technology, rather than cobbled together post-development. A crucial piece of this could be transparency and notice mechanisms on tools that are already in use. Building functional privacy and data agency into the technology requires not just theoretical privacy guarantees, but must be combined with usability and access to technology for a deployment plan that succeeds in realizing these privacy and data agency benefits for actual users, and so must be developed in communication with the communities and groups we are aiming to include. Deep collaboration with existing civil society organizations and community groups will be needed to understand and mitigate concerns of inequality. As seen with contact tracing technology, sociotechnical systems surrounding deployment build trust with people through offline means, and are central to adoption and widespread use.\n",
            " Equity concerns include how user data may be used in a way that may deepen systemic inequalities. For example, contact tracing technology in Singapore originally promised to only use data for public health purposes, but since has been shared with and used by police. [2] In the US, an investigation revealed that the Care19 smartphone app developed for North and South Dakota's health departments was sharing user information with both Foursquare and Google, despite this violating the app's stated privacy policy. [6] One way to mitigate against such breaches of trust is to put safeguards into the design of the technology that protect against misuse and surveillance-creep.\n",
            " Looking to existing or upcoming examples of broad-based credentialing efforts will be central to determining processes for public education. The EU's Digital Green Certificate (\"Green Pass\"), for example, would use a QR-code based system to enable anyone vaccinated against Covid, or who has tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus, to travel across all 27 member states. Accessible and secure certificates for all EU citizens is a key element of the proposed regulation, [1] but there remain implementation concerns.\n",
            " Our Principle: Meaningful and user-friendly information must be provided in user-friendly form along with technology deployment, both to promote participation as well as to ensure informed choice. In addition, we must ensure 100% interoperability with low-tech and paper credential options so that privileged or tech-savvy communities do not receive disproportionate benefit. We acknowledge there will be some convenience gap, and must take care that this does not spill over into structural consequences for individuals who cannot or choose not to participate in this particular technology. We commit to paying special attention to understanding those who may not want to or be able to participate in the vaccine credentialing process.\n",
            " There are a range of ethical concerns that may arise from this technology and deployment strategy. One sensitivity involves concern that wide deployment of easyto-use vaccine credentials would make it possible to mandate vaccines. This is an incredibly politically sensitive issue, with communities across the country particularly concerned about being excluded from basic public spaces due to lack of vaccination -and by extension, lack of vaccine credentials necessary for access and equity. In the most extreme cases, we've seen extremists directly target technologists and organizations.\n",
            " These issues are likely to be exacerbated if people are not provided with agency, transparency, and education to understand the process, the technology, and the choices available to them. As has been seen repeatedly with poor notice experiences across IT services, lack of explanation hinders trust and adoption.\n",
            " By coordinating across Public Health Authorities (PHAs), the standards community, and civil rights and civil society organizations, a communication and adoption plan can be developed to increase trust, understanding of the tech's intended and safe use, and good outcomes. This is particularly important at a time when public distrust of technology and tech companies is rising, and there is already growing sentiment against government-mandated vaccines and COVID monitoring in general.\n",
            " Developing robust choices and controls for credential use and providing practical education of the of those controls and choices will increase trust and adoption. Clear communication will be crucial; individuals must be made fully aware of how their vaccine credential data may be used, whether by their own choice or legal requirement. Individuals should be able to access, maintain, and delete or replace the vaccine credential, and do so in a way that is easy to understand. Marginalized populations may not have the resources to request a physical credential if they lose access to their digital credential.\n",
            " Our principle: We believe that individuals have the right to own and manage their personal health data, and further have the right to decide where and how to store this data. Given this, we are building technology that gives people more control and access to their own personal health data. Additionally, we will not build technology intended as a mandatory vehicle for vaccine credentials. We recognize that we must maintain oversight to ensure that businesses and consumers retain the freedom to choose which credential technology, if any, to adopt, and that no data is shared without consent in this process.\n",
            " The number one priority is to build a holistic vaccine verification system that works well for all users of that system -both individual and institutional. The priority is not to build a certain type of technology to accomplish this goal. The biggest challenge to this is that there has been little to no usability testing of the technology, either involving issuers, holders, or verifiers. Major gaps exist in this space:\n",
            " 1. Cryptographically verifiable credentials are new to the verifiers, and new to credential holders, who have to manage and present the credentials for verifications.\n",
            " 2. Many VC implementations use cryptography and tech are not largely standardized. There are a range of protocols and applications, across JSON-LD, LD-proofs, RDF, BBS+, etc., that are in use and comply with the W3C standards without themselves being fully standardized. In addition, interoperation with already issued paper credentials is still a work in progress.\n",
            " 3. VCs used for verifiable vaccination records (or other clinical data) must be capable of conveying the sometimes-nuanced semantics of health records, which can include optional data elements, jurisdiction-specific codes, \"modifier elements\" and other complexities that verifiers (or intermediaries aiming to simplify the job of verifiers) must be able to process.\n",
            " There are a slew of startups in this space, and demand from customers and sales is creating uncomfortable pressure on engineers to build and deploy technology in a rushed and haphazard manner in order to be early to market. Technology supposedly built to support COVID response has consistently shown its brittleness when actually deployed, [4] often increasing burden on healthcare workers and public officials, and leading to public distrust. Avoiding this outcome must be one of our top priorities.\n",
            " It is likely that a robust, well-communicated, privacy-preserving and interoperable digital solution is the most scalable way for large-scale access to usable credentials. With appropriate safeguards and care for people, this technology can play a part in allowing a return to life and work in the next stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            " Our principle: Our primary goal is to build something that works for people and that must also follow our principles. Many top-down approaches to COVID technology have failed catastrophically when deployed in the real world, or have failed to achieve adoption as communities organize to fulfill their own needs with stable and trusted lower-tech options (such as spreadsheets and telephone calls). We are committed to working in coordination with the affected communities and involved institutions, moving carefully and thoughtfully when testing and deploying, and addressing the social, economic, and policy realities of COVID vaccinations.\n",
            " One of the major strengths of verifiable credentials is their emphasis on privacy; this is one of the clear benefits over paper certificates with no technology component, such as a QR code. The minimal amount of data is used to create the credential, which is generally a subset of the data collected and/or used to administer vaccines. Credential holders will need to understand what the privacy and security tradeoffs are, via transparency and education, as well as through education from the Public Health Authority (PHA). PHAs can both drive regulatory protections for credential holders and share that information with people, and share information about the benefits and risks of the different credential tools. Design of the technology should include user interfaces that make clear what data is being shared, and easily allow a person to share the minimal amount necessary.\n",
            " One mechanism for verification is through public-private keys -the verifier will be able to calculate whether an issuer has signed a particular document with their private key, through knowing the issuer's public key. A fundamental vulnerability is the compromise of a private key. Another potential vulnerability is that if verifiers collude, they can track a user's movements. There are several ways to address these concerns, such as pairwise identifiers. Another common distinction between types of credentials is whether Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are integrated, which allow assertions to be verified about a credential without giving all the information in a credential (for example, calculating that someone is over 21 without seeing their age). This is one extreme of a spectrum of technologies to limit how much information is exposed when showing a credential, which range from only being able to show the entire credential, being able to only show specific bits of a credential, and being able to show just a fact that can be derived from the credential. The extent to which this creates or reduces privacy concerns also depends on the use case. However, the ZKPs have not been implemented at scale yet, and the technology is thus largely untested.\n",
            " It is not enough just to verify that a credential is legitimately issued, a verifier must also know that the credential belongs to the person in front of them. The simplest way to do this is to have the person's name, and other datapoints such as an address, included in the credential, allowing the verifier to confirm their identity using traditional methods such as a photo ID. This is yet another area where depending on the use case this may be more or less ideal. For airlines and employers, revealing common attributes of a person's identity isn't a privacy concern, since the verifier is already aware of these attributes. Another challenge is that identity verification of vaccine recipients has not been performed robustly during the vaccination process in some countries, including the US and the UK. Individuals are not necessarily being asked to show personal identity documents prior to vaccination, or are being asked to fill in their names on paper-based vaccination credentials themselves.\n",
            " Our principle: There are a number of types of digital vaccine credentials and storage methods. For individuals who opt to use systems that store their vaccination data, data collected for vaccine credential purposes should be used only for that purpose, with appropriate safeguards and security. Data should not be shared without permission, and should be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed. The minimal amount of information should be collected and shared as is necessary for the intended use. (See Microsoft's Privacy Principles for more.)\n",
            " Given the many players in the space, and in the extended universe of healthcare credentialing and digital identity, vaccine credential initiatives are running up against the question of interoperability. There are multiple interoperability challenges to be addressed in order for Vaccine Credentials to work, and different groups are focusing on different areas, guided by differences in principles.\n",
            " • Interoperability of Adoption. No matter how perfectly designed a credential system is, it won't interoperate in practice unless the necessary stakeholders adopt and implement it correctly. One approach to driving adoption would be to legislate mandatory use of a specific verifiable credential, which has been suggested but has significant downsides in preserving choice, consent, and privacy. Instead, regulation of credential technology must be approached with collaboration from those who would be required to implement and use it, to avoid implementation failure and backlash. This will in practice require significant investment in education across relevant institutions, stakeholders, and user communities to ensure an understanding of and access to the technology to facilitate adoption. As of now, there also does not yet exist a plan to interoperate digital verifiable credentials with the paper vaccine proofs and certificates that are currently being handed out to vaccinated individuals. Given that hundreds of millions of individuals have already been vaccinated before verifiable digital credentials are widely available, this is a significant gap in interoperable adoption. The DIVOC initiative in India does use paper certificates with QR codes as one version of digital credentials, [3] but we currently have minimal information on the rollout success of this.\n",
            " • Interoperability of Data. Ultimately, vaccine credential holders will need to show whether they meet the requirements of being vaccinated. However, the data behind a vaccine credential must include more than a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" as the science behind vaccines progresses. Whether a person is considered vaccinated may depend on how long ago they got their vaccine, the efficacy of the vaccine they received on new variants, and other unknowns. The data standards used should align credential issuers and verifiers on the right data in the right format, which will involve close collaboration with medical professionals and public health authorities (at local, national, and international levels) to get health data right, and advocating for adoption of this standard.\n",
            " • Interoperability of Trust Framework. Once the data for a credential is established and securely packaged, it gets issued to the user, who can choose to present it to a verifier. There are a number of ways to accomplish this, each with different privacy and security features depending on the intended scope of use, and this area is being rapidly developed as groups coordinate to develop trust frameworks that include higher degrees of privacy and security applicable to a wide range of sensitive use cases. For example, it may be easier to maintain a list of trusted issuers for those issuers that are large established institutions as well as issuers with resources to spend on getting on the list, and less so for small local clinics and private practices, creating a tradeoff between two outcomes:\n",
            " i. Verifying credentials from a plurality of potential issuers may lead to exploitation of the system and false credentials being issued, which in turn could lead to credential fraud.\n",
            " ii. However, being too conservative with the trusted list could lead to smaller or less well funded clinics being left off the list, potentially increasing disparities.\n",
            " Current initiatives have different views on whether to create fully interoperable credentials and leave it to the verifier to choose to allow certain credentials for their purposes, or whether to curate a list of trusted entities that may issue credentials. Some groups have suggested that coordinating with a federal or state database of vaccinations may be the right answer to this question, but that itself can raise questions of health record centralization, as well as potential concerns for vulnerable groups -not to mention that state and federal governments have a particularly poor track record with COVID healthcare statistics. As the credential ecosystem develops it will likely move toward a trust framework that incorporates more features to safely encompass a larger scope.\n",
            " Regardless of what technical foundation is implemented short-term, it is crucial that standards are developed in partnership with other groups already building and piloting this technology, both for the sake of efficiency and robustness of rollout, as well as to build towards a stronger and more interoperable identity framework in the future. As much as possible, this technology should build on existing standards, given the timeline of standards setting and the urgency of vaccine credentialing efforts. Short-term choices made during this development process may well become part of the foundation for verifiable credential technology moving forward, and may also underpin healthcare technology more broadly.\n",
            " Our principle: Health data should be exchanged using a non-proprietary, open, and accessible standard. In the vaccine space, a number of groups are working on developing such standards, across jurisdictions and sectors. Our aim is to move forward in partnership with these organizations, while also interoperating with nondigital credentials, such as the paper certificates already being distributed to current COVID vaccine recipients in the US, and more traditional federated identity solutions. This requires us to actively build trusted relationships and collaborations across involved institutions.\n",
            " The technology and policy related to vaccine credentials are evolving quickly, with regulations and guidance being proposed and implemented by governments around the world. Small-scale deployments are likely to reveal improvements that are needed to the technology, and as systems are used we will continue to learn about how they function in the real world and affect real people. We should also expect to see our scientific understanding evolve as we learn more about covid, vaccines, and the effect of various public health interventions, including where the use of vaccine credentials has positive or negative outcomes. While we are hopeful that there is a place for vaccine credentials in public health policy to make people safer and incentivize staying up to date on vaccinations, this is still very much theoretical. Clumsy implementations of the technology may contribute to backlash or exacerbate existing disparities, leading to greater divisiveness surrounding vaccines. Vaccine credentialing also requires access to vaccines, and we should not contribute to gating services on proving vaccine use without universal vaccine access.\n",
            " We also expect a complex interplay between science, technology, and policy. As a society, we have difficult decisions to make regarding what combination of public health interventions and risk we are willing to accept. Some possibilities for return to daily life may include vaccine credentials, but on their own the use of vaccine credentials in one space (such as a workplace or event venue) cannot guarantee low covid risk in that space if there are still high rates of covid in the general population. There remain many unknowns, and we caution against overselling vaccine credentials as a public health solution before research becomes available.\n",
            " We cannot expect to plan for every problem and design the perfect system from the beginning, but should expect to continue to learn and adapt. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain oversight on all implementations of this nascent technology, listen to community feedback, and be transparent and flexible in our continued learnings as the landscape evolves. We should set up an active process for oversight from relevant stakeholders, particularly affected communities, through civil society partnerships and public transparency on our infrastructure choices and relevant policies.\n",
            " Our principle: As with all technology, vaccine credential technology is not neutral. It is often the case that short-term technology built to fulfil a specific, scoped need during a time of urgency can become foundational to the longer-term ecosystem. This requires putting in place firm boundaries surrounding the usage and implementation of vaccine credentials such that privacy is maintained, paired with the necessary oversight to address legal and ethical questions as the ecosystem evolves.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), denominated by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (1) , was first isolated during an outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese province of Hubei in December 2019. This virus belongs to Coronaviridae family and betacoronavirus subfamily, known to infect mammals, such as bats, mice, and pangolins. An example of this subfamily is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused an epidemic in 2002 involving 26 countries with over 8,000 cases (1) (2) (3) (4) .\n",
            " Since the outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated an accelerated contagious and spreading behavior (5) . The fast transmission and the high number of cases affecting worldwide have made the management of virus spreading extremely difficult. The transmission of the virus is person-to-person through fomites and respiratory droplets (5, 6) . Furthermore, fecal shedding has been shown up to 5 weeks after the clinical recovery (7) (8) (9) . Therefore, it is hypothesized that fecal-oral transmission could be another propagation route for SARS-CoV-2 (10), with an incubation period that can last approximately up to 7 days after exposure to the virus (6, 11, 12) . Interestingly, asymptomatic individuals display viral loads that have shown to be challenging to detect during the period of incubation (13, 14) . Consequently, the spreading of the virus has no contention, and therefore researchers actively work to find vaccines and treatments for this pathogen.\n",
            " In this article we discuss the current knowledge about the innate and adaptive immune response during coronavirus disease . Furthermore, we describe the scientific strategies currently undergoing testing for prophylaxis or treatment for COVID-19.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-stranded RNA virus with an estimated genome size equal to 29.9 kb (15) . In contrast, the genome size of previous pathogenic coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS) is 27.9 kb, and 30.1 kb, respectively (3, 16) . It has been predicted that SARS-CoV-2 has fourteen open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for four structural proteins: spike (S) that promotes the viral entry to host cell, membrane protein (M) that induces the membrane curvature and allows the union with nucleocapsid (N) protein.\n",
            " Additionally, the M protein interacts with the envelope protein (E) and allows virus assembly and release (15, 17, 18) . Fifteen non-structural proteins are also encoded by the ORFab portion (15) (Figure 1 ). Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 Sglycoprotein is cleaved by a transmembrane serine-protease 2 (TMPRSS2), producing two surface proteins S1 and S2 (19) . The virus attaches to the host cell by the S1-domain by means of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which binds to the Angiotensin Converted Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to promote the viral fusion and the release of the viral genome into the host cells that is required for the production of new virions (20) .\n",
            " The ACE2 receptor can be expressed by cells from the respiratory system, arteries, heart, and digestive tract (20) (21) (22) . In the respiratory tract, the receptor is expressed by pneumocytes type I and II located in the throat and lungs, as well as by alveolar macrophages (20) . Despite the low presence of ACE2 both in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, the tropism for type II alveolar cells can be explained by the presence of proteases that contribute to the viral proteolytic processing required for SARS-CoV-2 entry (23) . Three proteases have been described that can prime the S-protein: TMPRSS2, furin, and cathepsin B/L (22, 24, 25) . TMPRSS2, as described above, cleaves the S protein in the S2 subunit at the RRAR motif, particularly in a highly basic domain (20) . The furin protease also contains the cleavage RRAR sequence (23, 26) . It has been described that furin can be secreted by the alveolar epithelium cells and work on neighboring cells (26) . The synergy between furin and TMPRSS2 allows the viral entry to the cells (20, 27) . According a predicted analysis cathepsin B/L are endosomal cysteine proteases that facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV into the cells; however, the contribution of these enzymes to SARS-CoV-2 entry has not been described (28) .\n",
            " COVID-19 displays clinical manifestations any time from 6 to 14 days after the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (29) . The most frequent symptoms are fever, nasal congestion, myalgia, headache, and cough (5, 30) . However, anosmia and encephalitis have also been described for COVID-19 patients (31) . Further, respiratory impairment occurs with severe clinical manifestations, such as respiratory distress and pneumonia (32) . Comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases, are closely associated with the severity of disease, mainly because patients with these ailments could develop pneumonia and require intensive care unit hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and eventually extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (33) . Symptoms could lead to multiple organ inflammation, resulting in organ failure (34, 35) that can cause death to the affected patient (30, 36) ( Figure  2) . Globally, the lethality is near to 2%-3% (37, 38) , with the elderly population as the most susceptible (39) . Interestingly, it has been reported that after the illness, a minor percentage of patients can show the reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 (40) . Even more, virus reactivation can lead to the relapse of the patient (41, 42) . So far, the hospitalization of the patients that relapse has not been described (43) .\n",
            " In addition to the involvement of lungs, heart, kidney, liver, and bowels, SARS-CoV-2 seems to reach the central nervous system (CNS), causing a broad range of clinical manifestations that will be discussed next (44) . Similarly to other respiratory viruses (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) , the ability of coronavirus to enter the CNS has been demonstrated by using murine animal models (50) and in vitro neuronal cell cultures (51, 52) . Neurological symptoms were also shown for other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 (53) (54) (55) . It has been suggested that neurons are a potential SARS-CoV-2 target, because these cells express the ACE2 receptor (31) . Other cells from the CNS like astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are also targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to they also express the ACE2 receptor (56) . In addition, a recent report showed that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in neurons and microglia from deer mice at day 6 post-infection (44) . Consistent with this notion, is the observation that 36.4% of patients can display several neurologic symptoms, including headache, encephalitis, impaired consciousness, and even the Guillain-Barrésyndrome (57) (58) (59) . Possible routes for the virus to enter into the CNS are the peripheral nerves and the bloodbrain barrier (BBB), whether the virus uses immune cells or to go through the BBB remains to be defined (45, 60) . Along these lines, it has been observed that patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 suffer from olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs) (57) . Symptoms that seems to be more frequent in women than in men (61) . Among the symptoms of taste disorders, dysgeusia and ageusia were observed, while hyposmia, and anosmia also occurred as olfactory disorders (62) . It has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV can enter the CNS through the olfactory bulb (62) . Since SARS-CoV-2 generates symptoms involving OTDs, it can be suggested that this virus can arrive at the olfactory bulb and enter the CNS (63) . However, because the olfactory sensory neurons were found not to express the ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 could not infect them, unless it uses another receptor that has not been described yet (63) .\n",
            " Another coronavirus as HCoV-OC43, is thought to enter the CNS via the hematogenous route as an immune cell carry-on (64) . It was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 also can enter the CNS through a hematogenous route. Using in vitro models for the BBB, the presence of ACE2 receptors was shown in blood vessels from the frontal cortex along with the brain microvascular endothelium (BMVEC) (65) . Furthermore, the S protein seems capable of disrupting the BBB (65) . Additionally, there is evidence for the presence of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), proving that SARS-CoV-2 can reach the CNS (62) . An alternative to the hematogenous route for SARS-CoV-2 may be transporter or pass through the tight junctions from the epithelial cells in the choroid plexus and the endothelial cells from the veins located in the subarachnoid space, which are the cells that are part of the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) (65, 66) .\n",
            " Interestingly, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade the CNS is thought to be associated with respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19, though this notion still remains to be conclusively defined (67, 68) . Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect that the virus has on the CNS and the neurological symptoms that this pathogen causes in humans.\n",
            " Although the immunopathology of coronaviruses remains poorly understood, the elucidation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 will help to develop vaccines and therapeutic strategies to control the infection or to improve the clinical progression of patients. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, the immune response elicited by this pathogen is not yet comprehended. In this section, we discuss the main findings relative to the immune response to the virus and how this response affects the lungs.\n",
            " Much remains to be understood about the molecular immune mechanism involved in SARS-COV-2 infection. Commonly, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from microorganisms are recognized by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) (69) . When viral fusion occurs, the viral genome can be recognized by various PRRs expressed by host cells (70) (71) (72) . Among the PRRs that recognize viral RNA, it is essential to highlight toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8 that trigger the myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD88) pathway upon binding to viral ssRNA (73, 74) . Additionally, viral proteins can be recognized by TLRs and trigger the TLR4-MyD88 pathway (75) . All these pathways promote the expression of type I IFNs (73, 76) . Nevertheless, a deficient type I IFN response is observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro (77) . An inefficient type I and type III IFN response has been suggested to associated with increased patient fatality. No IFN-b and IFN-l could be detected in plasma samples and lung biopsies from SARS-CoV-2 individuals (78, 79) . Type I interferon levels increased in patients suffering from severe disease and that improved after a critical condition (78) . Even though the TLR-4 pathway involves the activation of the Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), studies have shown that this kinase does not get activated during an in vitro infection with SARS-CoV-2 (77). All these in vitro results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could inhibit the IFN pathway at one or more of the steps mentioned above. Contrary to the in vitro results, during infection of mice with SARS-CoV-2, an increase in IFN-a and TBK-1 was observed, with a peak at day 6 post-challenge, followed by a decrease in the expression of these molecules (44) . These data suggest that there might be an IFN response during the infection in vivo, which declines later as the viral loads from the lung tissue (44) .\n",
            " Hematological studies have shown a progressive increase in the number of neutrophils in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients (40, (80) (81) (82) , especially in those cases with respiratory distress (83) . Furthermore, pulmonary infiltration has been found in autopsies of COVID-19 patients (84) . On the other hand, COVID-19 patients had shown low eosinophil levels that could be considered as a laboratory biomarker (40, 80, 81, 85) . Moreover, the presence of natural killer (NK) cells is reduced in COVID-19 patients, which might be associated with higher levels of chemokines ligand (CXCL) 9 and 16 (77) . It is thought that a decrease in IFN-g secretion could be associated with an impairment of the antiviral immune response (81, (86) (87) (88) (89) .\n",
            " Some patients have shown a cytokine storm release (CRS) response associated with a negative prognosis, including death (90) . CRS is an excessive inflammatory response induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which in severe cases consists of the reduction of T cells and diffusing airway damage due to the infiltration of immune cells and the hyaline membrane formation (91, 92) . COVID-19 severe cases show increased levels of several cytokines and chemokines, at least five-fold or more than healthy controls (93) . Among them IL-2, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-SCF), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1A (MIP-1A), monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), IL-6, and IL-1RA had been shown to associate with the pro-inflammatory profile (5, 90, (93) (94) (95) (96) (97) . Moreover, IL-6 levels have been directly corelated to viral loads (95) . Also, increased IL-6 levels are detected before the intubation for mechanical ventilation (98, 99) . IL-6 levels are linked to elevated IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1RA levels and are associated with fatal outcomes (95, 100) .\n",
            " On the other hand, moderate pro-inflammatory cytokines have been observed in mild cases (89, 100), a finding not unique for SARS-CoV-2. Disease severity association with cytokine storm has been broadly studied for viruses such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can lead to a cytokine storm syndrome in encephalitis cases (101), influenza A and B virus (102) , and others coronaviruses including SARS-CoV (103) and MERS (104), Ebola virus, in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (105, 106) , and Epstein-Barr virus (107) . A schematic representation for the contribution of cellular infiltration to disease is shown in Figure 3 .\n",
            " Lymphopenia is the most characteristic immune manifestation of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (40, 80, 81, 85) . Subsets of T cells as CD4 + , CD8 + , and memory T cells are lower in severe cases, implying an inadequate antiviral response after SARS-CoV-2 infection (81, 85) . In this line, mild cases present an increase of CD8 + T cells until 11 days post-admission, which could be associated with the clinical outcome. Noteworthy, a case-report study shows that circulating T follicular helper cells (cTfh) progressively increased after 9 days post-admission during a mild disease and remain in peripheral blood during convalescent, consistent with antibody-secreting cells (ASC) (89) . Together with corroborating the data described above, this study also showed the recruitment of ASC and cTfh cells in the blood of patients. These levels are slightly elevated when compared to healthy patients, even after 20 days of symptoms onset (89) . Tfh cell function is essential for developing memory B cells and the production of high-affinity antibodies (108) . However, more studies are needed to better understand these interactions.\n",
            " Consistent with this, a higher B/T cell ratio has been found in COVID-19 patients (81, 89) . In mild cases, the ASCs are detected after 7 days of post-admission in association with viral clearance (89) . Also, in severe cases, ASCs levels are elevated compared to healthy controls, with a 31% expansion 7 days after the onset of the symptoms (109) . No significant differences were observed for IgM and IgG production against SARS-CoV-2, with a peak from 7 days until 40 days post-admission independent of clinical course (24, 81, 82, 89, 110) . Also, it has been shown that IgG levels in asymptomatic patients were reduced when compared to symptomatic ones, in addition to a reduction in neutralizing antibody activity (24, 81) . Along these lines, it was reported that only 19.3% of patients show a robust level of neutralization activity and that they decrease up to 28 days after their recovery, suggesting that neutralizing antibodies have a short halflife (111) .\n",
            " Studies reporting the immunophenotyping of the disease considered innate and adaptative responses, specifically, the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NRL) and the IgG levels. A report, patients were separated into four groups: NRL high -IgG high ; NRL high -IgG low ; NRL low -IgG high and NRL low -IgG low . The worse prognosis was found in both NRL high groups, positively related to fatality. Remarkably, NRL low -IgG low patients did not require mechanic ventilation (82) . The NRL has been considered a reasonable and helpful measure to define disease severity in patients (112) (113) (114) (115) . This knowledge has been the key to identifying disease severity markers, which could contribute to defining therapeutic targets and for developing prophylactic strategies and vaccines.\n",
            " Due to the broad distribution of ACE2 molecule, SARS-CoV-2 infection could be displaying a multiorgan involvement (116) . Nevertheless, the most frequently affected organ is the lung and an acute lung injury (ALI) can develop. Up to date, little is known about the mechanism involved in lung dysfunction. Histopathological analyses from deceased patients have revealed significant changes in the lung, highlighting the alveolar damage with desquamated pneumocytes, hyaline membrane, fibrinous exudate, and immune cell infiltration (117) . Specifically, alveolar macrophages are found in the lumen and lymphocytes in the interstitium, associated with diffuse alveolar damage. The high infiltration controls the infection (84, (117) (118) (119) , consistent with leukopenia in hemogram founded in affected patients. The diffuse damage in the lower respiratory tract could be due to infection in the Clara cells, a non-ciliated secretory type cell, and the evasion of an early immune response, such as interferon type I, allowing a high viral replication in the lower respiratory tract (77, 118, 120) .\n",
            " During the infective process, the virus displays mechanisms to avoid the immune system of the host (78, 79) . Once the innate immune cells recognize the viral particles, they become activated with the aim of clear the pathogen. Although peripheral myeloid cells play a crucial role during the innate immune response, little is known about their contribution during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analyses performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from infected patients revealed a downregulation of genes related to degranulation and activation of immune cells, such as neutrophils in BALFs (121) . Similar results were obtained from studies performed using necropsies (88, 92) . On the hand, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is upregulated in BALFs of infected individuals (121) . Remarkably, genes that encode for chemokine ligands (CCL)-2/MCP-1, CCL-3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP-1b, CXCL2, CXCL8 and CXCL10/IP-10 expression were increased in SARS-CoV-2 patients, suggesting important recruitment of monocytes/ macrophages and neutrophils at lung during SARS-CoV-2 infection (121) . These findings are consistent with the low levels of peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes that are associated with elevated expression of CCL8 and CCL2 and CXCL9 and CXCL16 in the blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients (77, 122) , suggesting the migration of peripheral T cells to control the lung damage from the interstitium to the alveolar space (91) . In addition, high levels of CXCL8 were detected in SARS-CoV-2 patients (77) , which can promote the recruitment of granulocytes to the tissue and the production a pro-inflammatory environment in the alveoli (123, 124) . One explanation for the damage of the airway epithelium is the recruitment of immune cells and the contribution of the degranulation to eliminate the infected cells, promoting an inflammatory state that can last until the viral clearance. As a result of this process, pulmonary damage is produced in a manner equivalent to other respiratory viruses (94, 125, 126) .\n",
            " Currently, the world science is focused on the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (127) . The need of developing vaccines during pandemic times represents a major challenge for science and medicine. First, SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus strain, without a complete understanding of the best animal model for this infectious disease. Despite these difficulties, scientists worldwide work to advance with the highest possible velocity to develop and evaluate vaccine prototypes. Inactivated virus, DNAbased strategies, non-replicating viral vector, protein subunits, replicating viral vector, live attenuated virus, RNA-based, and VLPs are within the strategies being developed (128) . In the last WHO report, 152 vaccines prototypes are being tested in preclinical models, and 42 are tested in humans, with ten of them in phase (129) . Besides, until October 15, 2020, 10 studies, which showed immunogenicity and safety in previous phases, are in the early stages of Clinical Phase 3 ( Table 1 ). As part of these phase 3 studies, between 30,000 and 65,000 volunteers have been recruited to evaluate these vaccine prototypes around the world (130) .\n",
            " The inactivated virus formulation has been broadly used for licensed vaccines being used for decades to prevent emerging respiratory diseases (131) . Phase 1/2 clinical trials revealed the safety of using an inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 with a range of adverse reactions between 20% and 30% of those vaccinated and a robust neutralizing response after the second dose (132) (133) (134) .\n",
            " An inactivated vaccine generated by Sinovac (CoronaVac) was evaluated pre-clinically rats, mice and rhesus macaques, with two doses, on days 0 and 7 days after challenge, secretion of IgG of 10 5 approximately 1 week after immunization against the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein important to obtain a robust IgG secretion. Consistently, neutralization assays were carried out. A high titer of neutralized antibodies (1 x 10 4 approximately) is observed 6 weeks after immunization, the results are similar for clinical phase 1 and 2 study with two doses at 0 and 14 days (133, 134) . Also, Coronavac has not shown significant severe adverse reactions in Phases 1 and 2. Thus, this vaccine has moved on to a Phase 3 clinical trial (135) .\n",
            " The inactivated vaccine developed by Sinopharm evaluated in Phases 1 and 2 clinical trials was administrated intramuscularly in two doses (5 ug/dose) at 0 and 21 days. According their interim reported showed high titers of neutralized antibodies in volunteers, 1 x 10 3 approximately (132). Currently, this vaccine is in Phase 3 (135) .\n",
            " BBIBP-CorV is an inactivated prototype of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 tested in six clinical models (including mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman primates), which were immunized intramuscularly route twice on days 0 and 21. These mammalian species were challenged with SARS-CoV-2; the vaccine-induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies do not produce significant adverse effects in the biochemical serum parameters. Furthermore, it was observed that immunization with two doses with 2 ug/dose of BBIBP-CorV conferred significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 (136).\n",
            " Adenovirus-based vaccines are led by AstraZeneca, CanSino Biologics Inc, Gamaleya Research Institute, and Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V (130) . AstraZeneca produced a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in their report indicated the vaccine was tolerated with 1 g of paracetamol every 6 h, which must be administered prophylactically 24 h before vaccination (137) . The response of IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 protein S reached a peak on day 28 and was maintained until day 56 after vaccination. Furthermore, the IFN-g response peaked at day 14 and antibodies capable of neutralizing live SARS-CoV-2 were induced on day 28 after a booster dose (137) . The Phase 3 clinical trial of this vaccine prototype was paused to allow the review of data by an independent committee, due to a suspected severe adverse reaction in two different patients. After this review, the trial was restarted in India, Brazil, and the UK (138) .\n",
            " CanSino Biologics INC developed a prototype with recombinant adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) called rAd26-S + rAd5-S, which expresses the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. In phase 1/2 studies it was shown that the vaccine is safe, well-tolerated, with the majority of adverse reactions of mild or moderate severity which include fever (46%), headache (39%), fatigue (44%), vomiting (2%), loss of appetite (16%), diarrhea (11%), and occur in the first 7 days post-vaccination. In general, this vaccine induced a strong humoral and cellular immune response in healthy patients, which begins to be observed 14 days postvaccination. Secretion of IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-2 by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was measured, and a peak was observed at day 28th post-vaccination). A single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine vectorized with Ad5 caused a four-fold increase in RBDbinding antibodies and virus neutralization (139). Due to the success of this prototype, it had advanced to a Phase 3 clinical study (129) .\n",
            " A preliminary report from a phase 1 for a mRNA-based vaccine against SARS-COV-2 (mRNA-1273) indicated that seroconversion appears on day 15 after the first vaccination (140) . Also, antibody neutralizing activity was detected after the second vaccination (140) . A report of phase 1/2 of RNA vaccine BNT162b1 indicated that the candidate elicited a higher titer of nAb than the convalescent group, with a temporal decrease of lymphocytes that return to baseline levels between 1 week (141) . No data for T and B cell immunity have been reported yet (141) .\n",
            " Subunit vaccines used protein-S, and RBD subunits since S protein must have a stable domain (142, 143) . It was shown that spike-immunized mice developed a virus neutralizing antibody response that lasted for 10 weeks approximately (144) . Novavax designed a prototype with an innovative adjuvant Matrix-M1 adjuvant, a positive correlation between the immunization dose mixed with adjuvant with the production of neutralized antibodies was obtained (145) . Also, this prototype is evaluated in Phase 3 (138) .\n",
            " The recombinant viral vector methodology has been widely studied for the development of vaccines and gene therapy (146) . Viral vectors used for this strategy are measles virus, poxvirus, adenovirus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (147) . This type of prototype has been widely studied with adenoviruses since they can induce a population of CD4 + and CD8 + cells (148, 149) . For SARS-CoV-2, this vaccination strategy has used the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with replicative capacity, which expressed a modified form of the S-gene of SARS-CoV-2. This preliminary study demonstrated a decrease in viral load in mice immunized with two doses of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 and challenged with SARS-CoV-2, at 4 days post-infection in samples of lung, splenocytes, heart, and nasal lavage, in addition to high IgG secretion (150) .\n",
            " Trained immunity is based on acquiring a type of immune memory by epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells, such as monocytes and NK cells (151, 152) . It has been observed that the tuberculosis vaccine consisting of an attenuated mycobacteria Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) produces a long-lasting trained immunity consisting of these innate cell populations (153) (154) (155) (156) (157) . It has been hypothesized that BCGvaccination could associate with decreased disease severity and lethality during COVID-19 worldwide (158) . The lethality reported by COVID-19 in countries with BCG vaccination is about 5.8 times lower than countries without the BCG vaccination program (159) . Equivalent suggestions have been made by other studies supporting the notion of using the BCG vaccine to prevent severe COVID-19 at least in the most vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and healthcare personnel (160, 161) . Recently, a study in a hospital from the United Arab Emirates demonstrated that a boost with the BCG vaccine in the healthcare workers could reduce the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (162).\n",
            " However, clinical trials are needed to scientifically define the impact of BCG vaccine as a preventive measure for COVID-19. Along these lines, since WHO declared a pandemic for SARS-CoV-2, more than 21 clinical trials are currently in progress to evaluate whether BCG vaccination in adults and healthcare workers could decrease the symptoms caused by COVID-19 (163) . Some of these first clinical trials were performed in the Netherlands (NCT04328441) and Australia (NCT04327206) as phase III clinical trials (163) . In addition, one phase IV clinical trial is in progress (NCT04417335).\n",
            " Despite the promising results of BCG vaccination, up to date there are not yet published data demonstrating the benefits of the BCG vaccine in clinical trials. Moreover, the WHO did not recommend the BCG vaccine as an approach for COVID-19 (164) . It is likely that the WHO decision was based on the lack of direct clinical evidence supporting a benefit for SARS-CoV-2 infection and that an increased demand for the BCG vaccine could jeopardize the supply for tuberculosis rates vaccination (164) .\n",
            " The design of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 has been oriented in three fundamental directions: viral elimination using molecules that can interfere with viral replication, antiinflammatory therapies, or palliative treatments that help reduce symptoms and the regulation of the immune response (165) . The COVID-19 emergency had challenged researchers to design treatments. In the meantime, clinicians have given some already registered drugs to reduce disease severity in patients.\n",
            " Furthermore, recent findings suggest that clinical recovery can be promoted by the administration of antiviral therapy before lung disease is at an advanced stage (166, 167) . In this section, some drugs and other therapeutic strategies under evaluation will be described. A summary of the therapeutic approaches is described in Table 2 .\n",
            " Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog that works as an inhibitor upon binding to the viral RNA strands and disrupts new the synthesis viral genomes with successful results against coronaviruses as SARS-CoV MERS-CoV, is currently tested for SAR-CoV-2 (168, 194) . In vitro studies in Vero E6 cells have shown that Remdesivir inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 after entry into the cells (168) . Medical reports published by China and the United States indicate a faster recovery of patients in response to the administration of Remdesivir (92, 169) . Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized this drug for severely hospitalized COVID-19 patients (195) . Later, the FDA approved the use of Remdesivir in hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, regardless of severity, based on the results in a controlled clinical trial including hospitalized patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease (NCT04280705).\n",
            " Favipiravir is a purine nucleic acid analog previously used to treat influenza, considered a prodrug whose active metabolite interferes with viral replication by inhibiting viral RNA polymerase (170, 191) . In a clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029600), the administration of Favipiravir combined with interferon−a (IFN−a) in patients with COVID-19, contributes to an enhanced viral clearance (171) .\n",
            " Lopinavir and ritonavir are protease inhibitors used in the therapy for human immunodeficiency virus 1. (HIV-1) (196) . SARS-CoV-2 patients treated with these drugs showed only a slight improvement (4, 5, 197) . The combination of lopinavirritonavir with ribavirin and IFNb/1b reduced viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs, stool, and saliva obtained from patients after 8 days of treatment (198) . Notably, IL-6 levels decreased significantly after treatment with this combined antiviral treatment (174) . These observations suggest that an early treatment with these drugs can decrease virus spread and reduce the exacerbated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (198) .\n",
            " Arbidol is a derivative of indole, which acts on aromatic amino acids and can interfere with the replication of the influenza virus (199) . In vitro studies on SARS-CoV-2 have shown that Arbidol can block the entry and trafficking to intracellular vesicles (176) . Arbidol reduces the risk of developing lung lesions when used alone or together with lopinavir/ritonavir to promote viral elimination without significant side effects (200) (201) (202) . Additionally, the mix of antivirals and interferon was shown to efficiently reduce both \n",

Currently, a clinical study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Arbidol as an adjuvant for an antiviral therapy combined with IFNb/1a in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (NCT04350684). The main restriction of antiviral treatments is the development of adverse effects, such as liver and cardiovascular damage, gastrointestinal disorders, and skin lesions, which are the most commonly reported for the antivirals mentioned above and could worsen the patient condition (168, 169, 171) .\n",
            " Chloroquine and its hydroxychloroquine analog are antimalarials that have been used for over 50 years as a prophylaxis and treatment (204) . Both drugs lead to a reduction of MHC class II expression, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1b and TNF-a (204) . Additionally, hydroxychloroquine can enter lysosomes, impairing the acidification mechanisms and the function of these organelles (205) .\n",
            " Previous data from in vitro studies showed that chloroquine can display an antiviral capacity against Chikungunya virus (CHIK) and SARS-CoV (177, 206) . Furthermore, chloroquine was shown to be able to inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into Vero E6 cells at concentrations that do not cause cytotoxic effects in vivo (168) . Due to these results, both drugs were applied as treatment to COVID-19 patients worldwide, with a constant debate about effectiveness (207) . However, later on during the pandemic, WHO suspended all clinical trials testing these compounds for COVID-19, as no significant improvements were found in treated patients. Furthermore, one clinical study showed a high fatality rate (63.6%) due to high hydroxychloroquine doses, which can cause cardiac toxicity (180, 181, 208) .\n",
            " N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine (or melatonin) is a derivative of tryptophan, an essential amino acid that plays a critical role in immuno-inflammatory events produced during a viral infection. Besides, melatonin acts as an antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress and reduces vascular permeability (209) (210) (211) (212) . The use of this molecule use has increased in atherosclerosis and respiratory distress, such as acute lung disease, viral or bacterial infections (209) (210) (211) (212) . Melatonin alleviates respiratory pain by reducing vascular permeability and can inhibit calmodulin, an essential protein for ACE2 function (182) . Because melatonin indirectly targets various cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2, including the ACE2, the use of this molecule against SARS-CoV-2 infection has been suggested (183, 213) . Currently, six clinical studies are evaluating the effectiveness and safety of melatonin as prophylaxis, both in critically ill and outpatients (NCT04474483, NCT04531748, NCT04409522, NCT04353128, NCT04530539, NCT04470297). Two of these clinical studies are currently in the recruitment phase, the first plans to evaluate the antiinflammatory effects of melatonin in a patient with COVID-19 (NCT04409522). The second takes advantage of the antiinflammatory effects of melatonin to proposed it as prophylaxis for health care workers (NCT04353128). However, it must be considered that this drug does not inhibit viral replication and transcription. Instead, the administration of melatonin only reduces the associated clinical symptoms (182, 214) .\n",
            " Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that has been shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and fatality caused by COVID-19 (215) . The use of corticosteroid for the management for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to viral infections is a controversial topic since these drugs can delay the elimination of the virus and increase the risk of secondary infections due to their immunosuppressive effect. Despite this, it has been used successfully to treat influenza A (H1N1) pdm09-associated pneumonia, reducing mortality (216) . Thus, dexamethasone can be used as a treatment combined with other antiviral or drug therapy (186, 215, 217) .\n",
            " Transfusion of plasma is used for acute infections and is a classic form of immunotherapy for emerging infectious-diseases (218) . This therapy is based on the passive administration of plasma with high titers of nAbs, generated endogenously by convalescent individuals (219) . Such a therapy is still in use and has been implemented successfully in diseases without a favorable treatment or specific vaccine (187) . During the last epidemics due to Ebola (EBOV), Influenza A-H1N1, and emerging coronaviruses, this type therapy has been implemented as an alternative for treatment (220) (221) (222) (223) .\n",
            " Mainly, transfer of plasma from convalescent patients after SARS-CoV or MERS infections showed viral loads reduction and improvement of clinical and laboratory parameters, with a decrease in temperature, increased oxyhemoglobin saturation, improved lymphocyte levels, and decreased C-reactive protein levels. Also, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) improves survival rates in patients (186, 224) . Similarly, recovery from COVID-19 disease was observed in patients with severe illness after treatment with convalescent plasma with high nAbs titters obtained from surviving donors (185) . Importantly, during an FFP treatment, other biological products involved in the recovery of patients, such as anti-inflammatory cytokines and defensins, are also transferred (225) . The principal limitation of FFP is to determine the optimal nAb titer required for an efficient virus neutralization (186) . Thus, hemovigilance is essential because some patients could need more than one dose of FFP depending on the severity of illness, as described for other viral diseases where plasma transfusion was utilized (226) . Moreover, the use of FFP has equivalent risks for adverse effects than any other blood component transfusion, such as allergic/anaphylactic reaction and infections due of other microbes (226) .\n",
            " Nevertheless, the reported incidence of adverse reactions after transfusion of convalescent plasma is less than 5% (227) . One of the precautions to consider is avoiding Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) (218, 227) . TRALI is a new acute lung injury and occurs during or within 6 h after transfusion (218, 228) . TRALI-patients present acute dyspnea, need of intubation, hypertension, hypotension, and acute leukopenia (218, 228) . To prevent acute lung injury, it has been recommended to transfer the plasma to patients who have never been pregnant or undergone an abortion, thus allowing to decrease the possibility of presenting the antibodies to HLA or granulocyte antigens in the serum that could lead to the development of TRALI (218, 229) .\n",
            " The half-life of antibodies determinates the election for the plasma donor (226) . Yet, researchers have not determined the reduction of viral loads in severe COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma treatment (CPT) or FFP and mixture with antiviral treatments (187, 224, 230) . Furthermore, given that the population at risk includes patients with comorbidity such as hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases, which are part of potential CPT donors, makes it challenging to validate CPT as one of the therapies that should be considered on a larger scale (224, 230, 231) .\n",
            " Despite all these questions, both advantages and disadvantages of the therapy should be taken into consideration for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on history and evidence, and due to the health emergency, CTP is currently used throughout the world and was recently approved by the FDA, with guidelines for healthcare professionals (232, 233) .\n",
            " Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a powerful tool for treating of several diseases, such as cancer and immunological illnesses (234) . Along these lines, various strategies are in progress to isolate different mAbs specific for various SARS-CoV-2 antigens, due the potential of mAbs against emerging viruses (192, 235) . Further, the use of mAbs against other emerging viruses has demonstrated potent neutralizing effects for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (234, 236) . Since mAbs have been previously tested as prophylactics for SARS, using mAb to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection stands as a promising approach to treat or prevent this disease, at least in the most susceptible individuals (235, 237) . Additionally, mAbs could be used as treatment against viral encephalitis, and their use might help reduce not only respiratory symptoms by also neurological symptoms (238) . For this reason, several groups are working on the development of this therapy for COVID-19 using various strategies.\n",
            " Human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks the viral entry in vitro, decreasing viral loads, however, in vivo, hrsACE2 failed to block viral entry (192) . Other strategies involve the development of mAbs from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals and 206 mAbs were recently isolated from eight of them. Although two of those antibodies blocked viral entry, their specificity and neutralizing activity requires further characterization (239) . More recently, a new mAb was discovered called MAb362, which is a cross-reactive human IgA mAb that was shown capable to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. This mAb also targets the S protein and prevents the binding with the ACE2 receptor (235) .\n",
            " Similarly, nineteen nAbs that target the RBD or the Nterminal domain (NTD) from the S protein were isolated from convalescent patients (240) . All the antibodies demonstrated an impressive capability of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, making them good candidates for clinical evaluation (240) . Additionally, the isolation of neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 from convalescent patients of COVID-19 led to the identification of two mAbs, CA1, and CB6. While both showed in vitro the capacity to neutralize the virus, CB6 outperformed CA1. Studies in the rhesus macaque model showed decreased viral loads due to intravenous vaccination at a dose of 50 mg/kg with CB6. Furthermore, a single dose of CB6 prophylaxis before exposure to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated protection in macaques against infection (241) .\n",
            " REGN-COV2 is an anti-viral antibody cocktail, which is composed by anti-spike antibodies that target the RBD of the protein (242) . This cocktail has the potential of being used as prevention as well as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 (242, 243) . Currently, REGN-COV2 is being evaluated in clinical trials as a treatment for non-hospitalized and hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and as prevention for the high-risk group of people (243) .\n",
            " Other mAbs have been tested in patients with COVID-19, such as tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor-specific mAb that was evaluated in at least one clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029765) showing beneficial effects in a cohort with severe COVID-19. Also, these mAbs were recommended for patients with low IgG levels and high NLR (82) . Nonetheless, adverse effects reported included increased hepatic enzymes (transaminases), thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, cutaneous rash and infections in the bloodstream. Other side effect were bacteremia and fungemia, which were likely the result of the IL-6 inhibition, which can impair B and T cell proliferation and function and diminish the immune response against infection agents (244) . Furthermore, mAbs capable of neutralizing pro-inflammatory cytokines could be applied to prevent or reduce the cytokine storm (82, 193) .\n",
            " Few studies are ongoing to identify and obtain mAbs against SARS-CoV-2, such as the NCT04342195 and NCT04354766. More than ten clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of mAbs as a treatment against this virus are in progress (245) . Within the first trials are the involved the use of TJ003234 (NCT04341116), gimsilumab (NCT04351243), and lenzilumab (NCT04351152), which are mAbs against granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The last one is currently in phase III clinical trial (245) . Other phase III trials in progress are REGN-COV-2 (NCT04452318) that has three different targets in the S protein, thus preventing the virus from entering into the cell, and LY-CoV555 (NCT04497987) that comes from a patient now recovered from SARS-CoV-2 (246) . Although no results have been published up to date, these mAbs seem as promising approaches for preventing or treating COVID-19.\n",
            " Heavy chain antibodies are derived naturally from camelids (247, 248) . Their lack of variable region has a smaller size than conventional antibodies, with high stability and affinity for each respective cognate epitope (247, 248) . Therefore, the isolation of a camelid-derived single domain antibody (SdAb) is considered a new promising therapeutic strategy (248) . Similar to mAbs, the therapeutic mechanism is focused on the virus neutralizing activity. For this reason, SARS-CoV-2 is mainly directed against RBD, blocking the union with the ACE2 receptor. A SdAb called H11 was identified with a higher affinity, neutralizing activity and a K D <1 mM (249) . Similarly, a SdAb called Ty1 was isolated from an alpaca after immunization twice with SARS-CoV-2 S1-sheep-Fc and the other two with SARS-CoV-2 RBD region in a 60 days scheme (247) .\n",
            " Even though it has been more than 6 months since discovering this novel coronavirus, the knowledge of the immune response elicited against SARS-CoV-2 remains scarce. So far, it has been proposed that the immune response is a major component of the pathology observed during COVID-19.\n",
            " The reduction of T cells in peripheral blood during SARS-CoV-2 infection could lead to an inadequate memory response, similar to what is described for other viral infections (81) . It has been proposed that a limited presence of eosinophils, monocytes, and T cell subsets in peripheral blood might be due to the large recruitment of those cells to the lung epithelium after infection ( Figure 3 ) (92). Consistently with this notion, it was shown that SARS-CoV and MERS impaired the host memory immune response (250) . Although, the long-lasting immune response cannot be elucidated yet, a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is expected to promote long lasting immunological memory (251) (252) (253) .\n",
            " Furthermore, there are still many unknown elements of the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2. The severe clinical cases have allowed us to begin understanding the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the host. Despite this, many questions have arisen about the immunopathology and as to how it can relate to pre-existing chronic diseases and severe clinical manifestations, even death in young people. Up to date, the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils have been suggested as markers of disease severity (254). As described above, several studies have revealed symptoms involving the CNS during COVID-19 disease. However, it has not yet been defined the mechanism for viral entrance in CNS. Additional studies are needed to explain as to how cytokine storm is associated to disease severity and patient with the outcome.\n",
            " Scientific efforts to design therapies are essential to prevent acute respiratory deterioration, the use of ventilation, morbidity, and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although during the pandemic, significant progress on vaccine development has been made, still no safe and efficacious vaccine is available for the use of the population. The fact that several of prototypes are currently starting phase III clinical trial evaluation ( Table 1) provides hope for an availability of vaccine for COVID-19 much sooner than for any other infectious disease. Furthermore, production of mAbs could be a parallel strategy for COVID-19 prophylaxis.\n",
            " It seems likely that an unbalanced immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection requires that the therapeutic interventions described above not only aim at eliminating the virus but also at regulating the immune response to prevent the exacerbated inflammation observed during COVID-19 (255) . The antivirals target different steps of viral replication, the combination of which could be useful to limiting viral loads and the subsequent spread of the virus, promoting an effective antiviral response by T cells (10, 11) . The combination of antiviral therapies with interferon can be beneficial to control viral spread (256). In addition, some antiviral drugs are capable of activating a cellular immune response on its own, stimulating the secretion of virus-specific antibodies and activating adaptive immunity (170, 257) . Finally, blocking the pro-inflammatory cytokine response is another crucial point for the design of therapeutic strategies to improve critically ill patients (82) .\n",
            " The search for a vaccine is an urgent need at a global level. Nowadays, technologies have allowed us to work by leaps and bounds searching for new vaccines or therapies against SARS-CoV-2. It is necessary to prioritize the health of volunteers and ensure the safety of vaccine prototypes, especially since the variety of potential adverse effects have not been fully understood yet, such as the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which stands as a risk of vaccination or immunotherapy. A full study regarding all the possible adverse effect is needed, as well as the transparency of the clinical studies that are carried out.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Adenoviruses are non-enveloped viruses with a double-stranded DNA genome. They were first discovered in 1953 by Rowe and colleagues (Huebner et al., 1954) . Adenoviruses are broadly present across vertebrate species and have been classified into five genera: Mastadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Siadenovirus, Atadenovirus, and Ichtadenovirus. Mastadenoviruses infect mammals and are classified into 7 species (A-G) (Seto et al., 2011; Dhingra et al., 2019) . None causes severe diseases in humans and, therefore, they are not considered a serious health hazard.\n",
            " Adenoviruses have icosahedral capsids of 70-100 nm. They are composed of 252 capsomeres, with 12 pentons. Each penton contains a fiber. The capsid fiber is responsible for the recognition and interaction with the host cell. Adenoviral replication and transcription take place in the nucleus of the host infected cell where viral DNA is first translocated through the nuclear pore associated with its core proteins (Charman et al., 2019 ; Figure 1 ). Adenoviruses have mid-sized DNA genomes (30-40 kb) , with genes encoded in both strands, and an extensive use of alternative splicing (Donovan-Banfield et al., 2020) . Adenoviruses present highly orchestrated sequential gene expression, with early (E1A, E1B, E2A, E2B, E3, and E4) and intermediate (IX and IVa) transcription units mostly displaying regulatory functions. Early genes are also responsible for inducing the Major Late Promoter, which activates the transcription of late expression units (L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5) that are processed by alternative splicing and encode the structural proteins of the new virions (Figure 2) .\n",
            " Human adenoviruses exhibit a highly variable tissue tropism, including the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract and conjunctiva. Infections are typically caused by inhalation of aerosolized droplets from infected individuals, conjunctival inoculation, or fecal-oral contact. They usually cause mild symptomatology such as cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, acute bronchitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, or conjunctivitis in patients. Even they are considered non-hazardous for the general population, there is an FDA approved vaccine against adenoviruses, consisting on an oral administration of live Ad4 and Ad7 serotypes, exclusively used for the US military personnel. This vaccine was developed to control an endemic adenovirus infection at military training camps resulting in the near elimination of Ad4/7 related disease (Broderick et al., 2017) . Currently, there is no approved vaccine for the general population (Kuschner et al., 2013; Lion, 2014) with an ongoing debate on whether it would be of general interest to develop a vaccine for public use.\n",
            " However, there is a growing interest for using adenoviruses as scaffolds in vaccine production to fight a broad repertoire of pathogens. Several key properties make them good candidates: infect dividing and non-dividing cells, can be delivered both systemically, or through mucosal surfaces, induce both innate and adaptive immunity, follow a lytic cycle and are physically and genetically stable. Even more importantly, adenoviruses are easy to genetically engineer, allow high levels of transgene expression, and are able to grow to high titers in vitro (Gao et al., 2019) . Adenovirus infection triggers the release of cytokines, generating an inflammatory milieu in the infected tissue. This is the consequence of the virus recognition by Pathogen Recognition Receptors or the specific interaction between the adenoviral fiber and the CAR receptor on the cell surface, activating a cascade of events that induce cytokine release (Majhen et al., 2014) . In the infected cell, adenoviral replication and viral protein expression when using replication-competent vectors triggers B cell and CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses against viral and transgene proteins. This immune response can be a beneficial effect in the vaccine context, where adenoviruses can act as a natural adjuvant (Robert-Guroff, 2007) . On the other hand, a balanced innate immune response seems optimal to elicit immunity as the induction of very high levels of type I interferon upon dendritic cell infection can downregulate transgene expression and the formation of optimal antibody responses (Hensley et al., 2007) .\n",
            " Adenovirus-based vaccines use replicating or non-replicating virus as platforms to express the vaccinating antigen or epitope (Figure 3) . The antigen in the formulated adenovirus vaccines can be present as a protein or as a transgene. If the adenovirus contains the antigen as a protein, there is no need for gene expression and the virus can be immunogenic even in the absence of infectivity or transduction. Usually the virus is engineered to display the antigen fused to a viral structural protein of the capsid such as the hexon or the fiber (Vujadinovic and Vellinga, 2018) . This antigen display on the capsid allows for the direct presentation of the antigen to B-cell receptors (membrane antibodies) and the indirect presentation to T-cell receptors. For the presentation and activation of T cells, the virus is internalized and processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that load viral and vaccinating antigen peptides in the MHC-I and MHC-II. Antigen display circumvents one of the main limitations of viral vaccines: the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies that opsonize the virus and prevent infection and gene expression. However, this approach is limited by the amount of exogenous protein that the hexon or the fiber can accommodate, restricting it to approximately 100 amino acids. Thus, most of the conformational B-cell epitopes that are not formed by contiguous protein sequences cannot be displayed appropriately in the adenovirus capsid to generate antibodies. As an alternative, the antigen can be encoded as a gene in the virus. This approach requires the transgene expression in APCs or in other cells that can indirectly provide the expressed antigen to APCs. Once infected with adenoviruses, humans develop neutralizing antibodies that preclude viral infection and, consequently, transgene expression. In these seropositive hosts, the gene-expression vaccine will not be effective. To solve this limitation, vaccines can be developed from rare or low-prevalent human serotypes such as HAd2, HAd26, HAd35, HAd48, or HAd64 or from adenoviruses from non-human primates (Bots and Hoeben, 2020; Garofalo et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, in the context of replication-competent vaccines, employing the first strategy seems the safest option for vaccination, as nonhuman virus zoonoses could potentially arise from the use of adenoviruses from other animals (Bots and Hoeben, 2020; Garofalo et al., 2020) . Therefore, improving viruses such as HAd5 is a promising strategy in adenoviral-based vaccine development. Viral shielding of Ad5 capsids with a variety of nanomaterials such as PEG, or PBAEs among others have shown to provide protection toward pre-existing Ad neutralizing antibodies (Hong and Yun, 2019; Brugada-Vilà et al., 2020) .\n",
            " Another key issue to address when considering adenovirusbased vaccines, as well as other virus-vectored vaccines, is the viral immunodominance. A strong response against the virus epitopes can mask the response against the vaccinating antigen (Schöne et al., 2017) . This occurs in naïve and in previously exposed hosts. When the host has been previously exposed to the virus and there are pre-existing memory B and T cells immunodominance is aggravated. This immunodominance was noted in a vaccination trial against HIV using adenoviruses (Frahm et al., 2012) . Moreover, eliciting a memory response will further dominate the breath of epitopes recognized. Again, this can be solved using rare low-prevalent serotypes or non-human adenoviruses, but cross-reactive immunity has been observed that may reduce the efficacy of this approach (Frahm et al., 2012) .\n",
            " When repeated vaccination is required, a classical strategy to palliate the viral vector immunodominant memory response is the use of a different virus expressing the same antigen in the second dose of the vaccine (the boost), known as heterologous prime-boost. However, even in naïve hosts the virus can still be immunodominant compared to the vaccinating antigen (Schirmbeck et al., 2008) . Immunodominance is associated to a competition of responding immune cells for adenoviral epitopes and antigen recognition. Several factors contribute to immunodominance (Sadegh-Nasseri and Kim, 2019; Abbott and Crotty, 2020). One key factor is the amount of antigen produced (Quinn et al., 2015) . Avoiding adenovirus gene expression using gutless vectors as vaccines can prevent virus immunodominance (Kron et al., 2011) . In humans, immunodominant epitopes for B and T cells are mainly present in capsid proteins, namely the penton, hexon and fiber (Tischer et al., 2016) . Codon usage can be used as a strategy to increase the efficacy of a replication-competent vaccine by increasing the relative levels of the vaccinating antigen compared to the levels of these immunodominant viral proteins but without decreasing virus gene expression to preserve virus replication.\n",
            " Successful recombinant vaccines based on the use of replication-deficient adenoviruses have been developed over the last years (reviewed in Majhen et al., 2014; Barouch et al., 2015) . Early developments were based on the deletion of the E1 region. Further improvements in vectorization resulted with the deletion of E1 and E3 regions what allows to accommodate transgenes of approximately 7.5 Kb. Such vectors are stable, easy to manipulate can be produced at high titers and they have shown safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials (Coughlan, 2020) .\n",
            " Nowadays, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several replication-defective adenoviruses expressing the spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 are in development. One of them, based on the HAd5, (clinicaltrials.org, NCT04341389) has shown tolerability and immunogenicity at 28 days postvaccination and could induce humoral and T cell immune responses, activating both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Zhu et al., 2020) . Interestingly, the Ad5-nCoV vaccine has shown a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in wild-type BALB/c mice and ferrets following intranasal immunizations, highlighting the potential of the mucosal vaccination route . A chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) administered to 1,077 participants showed an acceptable safety profile with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses (Folegatti et al., 2020) . Another adenovirus-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is under development using Adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26.COV2.S) and it has shown that a single shot of the vaccine induces protection in non-human primates (Mercado et al., 2020) . At present, this vaccine is being evaluated in clinical trials. A fourth adenovirus vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, which consists of two non-replicative adenoviruses based on Ad26 and Ad5 expressing the spike glycoprotein (S) and implemented in a prime-boost regimen. The vaccine was well tolerated and produced humoral and cellular immune responses in healthy adults (Logunov et al., 2020) .\n",
            " Despite the potential interest on replication-deficient adenovirus-based vaccines, obtaining immuno-protection usually requires high viral doses to elicit immunity. Adenovirus vaccines based on fully-replicative viruses are able to expand antigen expression and trigger improved immunity. However, the potential of replication-competent adenoviruses as vectors for immunization has been poorly explored to date. To preserve safety, replicative-competent adenovirus vaccines need to be attenuated to avoid causing pathologies associated with adenoviral infections. Therefore, a good balance between antigen-transgene expression and adenoviral replication is crucial to develop a successful vaccine.\n",
            " Live attenuated viruses are typically variants of the wildtype virus that have a reduced capacity to grow. Historically, attenuation was achieved by culturing viruses using cells from other species. Over time the virus would gain mutations allowing it to better replicate in the new host. If administered again to humans, the newly acquired mutations would then have a detrimental effect on viral replication resulting in a human attenuated virus (Smith, 2012) . This technique was timeconsuming and made it difficult to select and isolate the proper attenuated candidate.\n",
            " More rational strategies for virus attenuation in vaccine development have been in the spotlight of many researchers in recent years as they allowed for more efficient, specific, and safe vaccine development. Strategies based on genetic engineering of the viral genome have been studied. A group of these strategies include the deletion of dispensable transcription units. This also facilitates the accommodation of transgenic antigens, since for efficient viral packaging, the insertion of foreign sequences into the intact adenoviral genome is limited to around 1.8 Kb. Deletion of E3, which encodes gene products non-essential for viral replication has been commonly used. In these vaccines, the E3 promoter or the Major Late Promoter if splice acceptors are maintained or even stronger promoters such as the CMV drive the expression of the transgenes. One example is the Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccine in which the expression of the influenza hemagglutinin gene in the E3-deleted adenovirus serotype 4 genome induced protective immunity against H5N1 influenza virus infection in mice intranasally immunized (Alexander et al., 2012) . Oral vaccination with Ad4-H5-Vtn, in a phase I clinical trial, resulted in no serious adverse event suggesting its potential as a priming vaccine (Gurwith et al., 2013) . Another example of attenuation of replicative-competent adenoviruses by means of viral gene deletion is the replication-competent Ad26 with the E3 and E4 regions deleted generated as vector to develop candidate HIV-1 vaccines (Maxfield et al., 2015) . Which deletion is most suitable for an adenovirus vaccine may depend on different variables such as the size of the insert or the virus serotype among others.\n",
            " Additional strategies for viral attenuation rely on genome modifications to restrict adenoviral replication to specific cells by the use of miRNAs or tissue-specific promoters to modulate viral gene expression and tropism or the retargeting of adenovirus toward dendritic cells to increase antigen presentation (Tatsis and Ertl, 2004; Bofill-De Ros et al., 2015) . In general, replication-competent adenovirus vaccines lead to high transgene expression and require lower doses to confer persistent immunity. However, a good balance between the amount of the vaccinating antigen and the immunodominance of viral epitopes needs to be achieved to generate specificity in the immune response. In this regard, single-cycle replicating adenovirus have shown to amplify transgene expression. These vaccines replicate its DNA, and the transgene but incorporate a deletion that does not permit virion production (Crosby et al., 2015) . Alternatively, codon optimization of viral proteins and transgenes in order to maximize transgene expression while controlling adenoviral protein expression could be considered as a novel approach. This could boost adenovirus-based vaccine development opportunities.\n",
            " The genetic code is redundant, with eighteen out of twenty amino acids being encoded by two, four, or six synonymous codons. The frequency in which synonymous codons are used differs from what would be expected by chance, with some being rarely used and others more frequently. This phenomenon, known as codon usage bias, happens to be species-specific (Grantham et al., 1980; Pouwels and Leunissen, 1994) and is described to correlate with the relative abundance of iso-accepting tRNAs (i.e., the tRNAs that are associated with the same amino acid but recognize different codons). The correlation between specific tRNA abundance and codon usage could determine how efficiently particular transcripts are translated. In this way, codon optimality is correlated with how efficiently codons are decoded by ribosomes and thus, protein synthesis levels. The third base position in a codon (GC3) or (AT3) has been recently linked to human mRNA stability showing that GC3 codons stabilize mRNA while AT3 codons destabilize mRNA. Thus leading to consider GC3 codons and AT3 codons as optimized and deoptimized, respectively (Hia et al., 2019) . Due to the inherent viral dependence on cellular translational machinery, viral codon usage is, in many cases, considered as the result of mutational and selective pressure determined by the tRNA pool of the host cell (Duret, 2002; Das et al., 2005; Chamary et al., 2006; Hershberg and Petrov, 2008) .\n",
            " Substitution of synonymous codons based on the differential codon usage in a given organism has been used as a strategy to optimize or deoptimize the expression of viral proteins. Altering the codon usage of a virus by codon deoptimization has been widely explored for vaccine development against HIV, Lassa Virus, or Influenza virus among others (Mueller et al., 2006; Coleman et al., 2008; Cai et al., 2020) . Codon deoptimization of certain genes in the viral genome requires the use of less abundant or rare tRNAs within the host tRNA pool, leading to slower translation rates (Zhou et al., 1999; Jack et al., 2017) . This, results in a lower replicative viral fitness while maintaining a strong immune response and, due to the numerous mutations used to recode the engineered genes, avoiding reversion to virulence. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to consider not only the bias in codon usage, but codon pair bias, which considers that there are higher chances to find certain codons next to specific codons (Gutman and Hatfield, 1989; Coleman et al., 2008; Gamble et al., 2016) . In this line, polioviruses for example have been attenuated by recoding their genomes with underrepresented codon pairs (Coleman et al., 2008) . This attenuation strategies can work for both DNA and RNA viruses and are commonly used nowadays (Martínez et al., 2019) .\n",
            " Despite of the fact that codon deoptimization is a wellestablished general strategy for viral attenuation, there are no adenovirus-based vaccines attenuated via codon recoding. In fact, recent studies suggest that codon optimization, instead of deoptimization, could be a potential strategy for adenovirus attenuation (Villanueva et al., 2016) . In the context of replicationcompetent vectors, the codon recoding strategy should take into account an attenuated virus replication and the relative increase in antigen production compared to viral proteins. Experimental results after codon optimization of the adenoviral fiber in a non-viral system showed increased protein expression, reinforcing the importance of using optimal codons adapted to the host codon usage for efficient gene expression in nonviral contexts. Conversely, codon-optimized fiber expression, as well as the expression of other late proteins, were attenuated in a viral context, impairing viral fitness, thus leading to an attenuated adenovirus. We speculate that this attenuation is the result of a competition for a limiting pool of aminoacylated-tRNAs. Aminoacylated-tRNAs could then act as a limiting resource during the late phase of the viral replication cycle, which involves exceptionally high gene expression levels (Villanueva et al., 2016) .\n",
            " Following this argument, the introduction of transgenes using the same codons as other structural proteins could generate an intergenic competition resulting in the loss of viral fitness (Villanueva et al., 2016) . Indeed, an extreme optimization of a transgene could break the balance between the overall codon usage and the tRNA concentrations and affect the expression of other genes (Qian et al., 2012) . This is considered detrimental for virotherapy and links to the observation that in most clinical trials involving armed oncolytic viruses (where the aim is to obtain high levels of transgene and viral particles) the codon usage of the transgene is suboptimal (Núñez-Manchón et al., 2020) . We have recently targeted this question showing that, when expressing highly optimized transgenes, the transgene is highly expressed during the first round of infection, but its expression negatively impacts viral fitness (Núñez-Manchón et al., 2020) . We have further shown how, by deoptimizing the transgene codon usage, both the viral and transgene protein expression can be balanced, generating highly replicative antitumor viruses expressing therapeutic genes. From the adenoviral-based vaccine-development perspective, intergenic competition opens new and exciting opportunities where the transgene expression can be boosted while attenuating adenoviral replication. Therefore, optimization of the codon usage of the transgene could have a double impact resulting both in viral attenuation and in an increase of the engineered epitope expression (Figure 4) .\n",
            " Protein recoding to modify either viral proteins or transgene antigens should carefully consider that synonymous codon changes may affect protein conformation and stability or even alter protein function. Synonymous codons have been shown to contribute differently to the secondary structures of the resulting protein (Buhr et al., 2016) and most complex structures may contain non-preferred codons that are translated slower and, therefore, allow ordered and sequential folding of the resulting FIGURE 4 | Antigen-transgene recoding strategy for adenoviral-based vaccines. The scheme illustrates that codon optimization of the transgenic antigen induces its high expression while attenuates adenovirus fitness. Antigen expressed from the adenovirus is shown in brown.\n",
            " protein. Therefore, when recoding viral genes, or other viral epitopes for vaccine development, the immunogenicity of the new engineered gene needs to be carefully determined.\n",
            " Since tRNA availability is not the unique factor influencing protein expression, several other aspects concerning gene recoding are key for vaccine development (Brule and Grayhack, 2017) . For example, the increase of CpG dinucleotides frequency in both coding and non-coding regions has also been demonstrated to attenuate RNA viruses early after cell entry by preventing their replication (Burns et al., 2009; Atkinson et al., 2014; Simmonds et al., 2015) . Although little is known about the biological mechanism that leads to attenuation, this last strategy seems to be less effective than codon deoptimization (Groenke et al., 2020) , probably since it prevents a high expression of the viral genes and any engineered transgene epitope.\n",
            " Finally, attenuation of adenoviruses can have further implications helping to overcome anti-adenovirus vector immunity. Even if the immunogenicity of the adenovirus is desirable since it can act as adjuvant triggering inflammation, a too strong immunity could interfere with the specific antigen immune response of the vaccine reducing their efficacy. Thus, attenuation of adenovirus based-vaccines with synonymous genes recoding of viral proteins or transgene-epitopes is a promising strategy to favor specific antigen-transgene immune response.\n",
            " Codon optimization of the transgenic antigen in replicationdeficient adenovirus is a tested approach for increasing protein expression. A recent example of this strategy is the prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (Ad5-S-nb2) in which the S-coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2, inserted in the E1 region of an E1/E3deleted Ad5 vector, was optimized by altering the codon usage to efficiently express in human cells and (Feng et al., 2020) . The authors claim that the great potency of Ad5-S-nb2 may enable the induction of protective immunity using low dosages what could reduce side-effects. Several other examples have shown the benefits of eliciting a high transgene-specific immune response by applying codon-usage transgene optimization (Shoji et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2018) . However, in the development of DNA vaccines codon optimization did not always positively correlate with efficacy (Li and Petrovsky, 2016) . The fact that mRNAs contain multiple layers of information should be carefully considered by codon optimization strategies to avoid potential undesired effects.\n",
            " The use of adenoviral vectors as vaccines against viral pathogens is continuously growing and it is at the forefront of vaccinology.\n",
            " While there are still some obstacles to overcome, novel approaches are being developed that expand the field.\n",
            " Codon deoptimization has proven to be a useful and effective strategy for viral attenuation with different viruses. In the context of replication-competent adenovirus-based vaccines, synonymous recoding strategies have been poorly explored but codon optimization of adenoviral proteins and/or transgene antigens are showing good potential in vaccine development. Such knowledge can lead to the development of additional codon optimization strategies that can concert a good balance between transgene antigen expression and virus attenuation. However, the complexity of codon usage demands a profound understanding of adenovirus-host interactions. Moreover, vaccine manufacturing aspects should be taken into account when introducing such modifications to enable large scale productions that could meet the requirements for clinical applications. Altogether emphasizes the need for future studies that demonstrate the efficacy of transgene/adenoviral protein recoding to position this strategy as a real alternative in adenoviral-based vaccines.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be the most effective way to improve the current social distancing resulting from protective measures and to recover from economic damage (1) . With the acceleration of clinical trials, many countries have deployed national SARS-CoV-2 vaccination plans. However, the global emergence of multiple variant strains with enhanced infectivity over the last few months has presented great challenges for current vaccines (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) .\n",
            " So far, available coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines include recombinant proteins, RNA vectors, virus-like particles (VLPs), and inactivated virus. All of these share the neutralizing mechanism to produce antibody responses against the wild-type Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . It has been reported that vaccine candidates designed to target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S protein are preferentially effective because of the competitive binding of induced antibodies in the serum to RBD (16, 17) . Consequently, mutations in the RBD, such as S E484K/Q shared by P.1, B.1.351, B.1.617.1, and B.1.617.2, or S L452R presented in B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2, may cause allosteric alterations within the Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding surface and consequently compromise the immune protection from vaccination (2, (18) (19) (20) . Therefore, new generations of vaccines based on conservative sequences within regions that are responsible for the RBD-ACE2 interaction surface are urgent and necessary.\n",
            " In addition to antibody-mediated neutralization, recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 may be susceptible to cellular immunity. Rapid adaptive T-cell responses in some patients may account for their markedly lightened disease severity (21) . Simultaneously activated humoral immunity and cellular immunity have been shown to have effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 attack in animals and, in some cases, can significantly increase the antigen-specific immune memory and duration (22) . It would be of particular importance to address whether the inclusion of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell epitope could benefit the classic design of COVID-19 vaccines in terms of enhancing durable efficiency for the neutralization and clearance of currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains (23) (24) (25) .\n",
            " Here, we characterize a potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate RBD9.1, which is a specific linear peptide shown in our previous report (23) (24) (25) . The binding capability of COVID-19 convalescent serum to RBD9.1 is shown to be positively correlated to its neutralizing capacity. RBD9.1 is found to be located within a relatively conserved region of RBD. Immunization study demonstrated that in contrast to the compromised protection of the RBD-immunized group, the mouse sera from the RBD9.1 group exhibited sustained neutralizing efficacy against the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant strains as the wild-type strain. Furthermore, RBD9.1 can activate the P45-specific CD8 + T-cell response in mice and generate a long-term protection with both humoral and cellular immunity. The peptide candidate presented in our study may shed light on optimizing the COVID-19 vaccine design to better fulfill the growing need of global protection against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n",
            " From a pool of over 200 human monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD protein from COVID-19 convalescent samples (6, 26) , we have identified a linear region recognized by the most potent neutralizing antibody 58G6 (27) . It covers a 20-amino acid (aa) sequence within the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and is named RBD9.1. First, we asked whether RBD9.1 was associated with the production of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients. ELISA results showed that RBD9.1-specific antibodies were detectable in all 31 convalescent sera but not in the sera from the volunteers ( Figure 1A) . Based on the binding capability of RBD9.1-specific antibodies within each sample, convalescent sera were divided into two groups, termed Group 1 (low) and Group 2 (high) ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Table S1) in accordance with the average RBD9.1-specific antibody OD value of 31 samples. Detailed analysis of corresponding patient information showed that there was no correlation between the patient age or gender and the binding capability of the antibodies from individual samples (Supplementary Figure S1A) . Moreover, the neutralizing capability of both groups was detected through RBD blocking assay and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay (Supplementary Table S2) . Interestingly, we found that Group 2 demonstrated significantly higher ability in blocking SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus as compared with Group 1 (Figures 1B, C) . Correlation study confirmed that the amounts of RBD9.1 binding antibodies of individual samples were positively correlated with their neutralizing capability, represented by the RBD-hACE2 interaction inhibition titer (IC 50 ) or the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization titer (IC 50 ), respectively ( Figures 1D, E) . Meanwhile, no differences were observed for the neutralizing capability among convalescent sera from patients of different ages and genders (Supplementary Figures 1B, C) . These results suggested that COVID-19 convalescent sera with high binding ability to RBD9.1 exhibited marked neutralizing capability against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.\n",
            " Immunization With RBD9.1 Peptide Efficiently Induced Neutralizing Antibody Production in Mice Next, we determined whether RBD9.1 could induce immunogenic reactivity in vivo. The RBD9.1 peptide and another reported HBV peptide of 20 aa were coupled to RBD9.1 or hepatitis B virus (HBV) peptide to utilize for the immunization of Balb/c mice, with a dosing interval of 2-3 weeks (28) (Supplementary Figures S2A, B) . With three rounds of peptide injection, we were able to detect the presence of RBDspecific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in the mouse serum ( Figure 2A) . The level of these antibodies appeared to be positively correlated with the course and duration of multiple rounds of peptide injections ( Figure 2A ). This was like the production of the hepatitis B surface antigen-specific antibodies in mice immunized with the HBV peptide (Supplementary Figure S2D) . Additionally, we analyzed whether these antigen-specific IgG antibodies had any preference toward the Th1 or the Th2 subtype. ELISA results showed that the serum from mice immunized with RBD9.1 consisted of both RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG2a, while IgG1 exhibited approximately a 1,000-fold higher titer than IgG2a ( Figure 2A) . This suggested that a dominance of Th2-type antibodies was associated with the RBD9.1 immunization. Meanwhile, mice were immunized with highly purified RBD recombinant proteins that were expressed in FreeStyle 293F cells and isolated by affinity chromatography (Supplementary Figure  S2C ). As early as from a single shot, the full length of RBD was found to promote the production of RBD-specific IgG antibodies, preferentially the IgG1 subtype, which were at comparably higher titers than those from the RBD9.1 injections ( Figure 2A) . Furthermore, we determined whether these RBD-specific IgG antibodies from immunized mouse sera could block the interaction between RBD and hACE2. Serum samples obtained 10 days post the sixth RBD9.1 vaccination were applied in the RBD-blocking assay, we found that sera from both RBD-and RBD9.1-immunized mice exhibited competitive efficacy over hACE2 ( Figure 2B ). Although serum samples of the RBD group showed relatively increased levels of inhibitory effect at higher dilution rate compared to the serum from the RBD9.1 group, both could reach close to 100% competitive binding to RBD at high concentrations ( Figure 2B ). This indicated that the RBD9.1-and RBD-immunized mouse sera might contain neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we moved on to characterize whether the RBD-and RBD9.1-immunized mouse sera had any neutralizing potential against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants. Through sequence comparison, we found that the sequence of RBD9.1 was mostly conserved among wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and five of the most contagious mutant strains, with exception of B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2, which carried the S L452R mutation within the RBD9.1 sequence (Supplementary Figure S2G) .\n",
            " The pseudovirus neutralization experiment showed that the RBD sera had lower levels of geometric mean titers against all five variants than the wild-type pseudoviruses, with a range of 2.5-to 3.8-fold differences ( Figures 2C, D) . Importantly, the RBD9.1 antigenic peptide vaccine serum demonstrated sustained neutralizing capabilities for all five variants with comparative levels of IC50s as that of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses ( Figures 2E, F) . As negative controls, sera taken prior to RBD9.1 immunization or from the phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-injected group showed minimal or absent reactivity against any of the pseudoviruses (data not shown). A further evaluation of the key amino acids that might affect the binding affinity of the RBD-specific antibodies from the immunized mouse sera was performed. All the amino acids from RBD9.1 were individually substituted into alanine (A) (Supplementary Figure S2E) . The ELISA results showed that the binding ability of the RBD9.1 serum to RBD9.1 was significantly decreased only with S Y451A and S Y454A ( Figure 2G ). The S L452A and S L452R Figure 2H and Supplementary Figure S2F ). It is worth mentioning that approximately 50% of the amino acid sequence corresponding to the RBD9.1 region was conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, including the S Y451 and S Y454 sites with functional importance for antigenic binding ( Figure 2H and Supplementary Figure S2F ). Together, the above results suggested that immunization with RBD9.1 could efficiently induce neutralizing antibody production in Balb/c mice, which remained functionally effective for the neutralization of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variant strains.\n",
            " Successful production of high-affinity antibodies relies on the activation of the germinal center and the export of plasma cells post antigenic stimulation. Therefore, the accumulation of activated plasma cells after RBD9.1 immunization was studied. We examined the ratio of the CD19 -CD138 + plasma cells in the total lymphocytes from the blood, spleen, and the bone marrow of immunized mice on the seventh day after the last injection. The results showed that RBD9.1 could promote a significant proportional increase of the CD19 -CD138 + plasma cells in all three tissues relative to the PBS control at a similar level to the HBV group ( Figure 3A ). The RBD group showed a comparably higher level of CD19 -CD138 + plasma cell accumulation than that of the RBD9.1 group in both the blood and the spleen, while no significant difference was found between these groups in the bone marrow ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S3A ). Furthermore, ELISPOT experiment showed that RBD-specific plasma cells were only detectable in the RBD and the RBD9.1 groups, and the number of spots in the RBD group was markedly higher than that of the RBD9.1 group in the spleen but not in the bone marrow ( Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S3B ). Further analyses of the germinal center of each group showed that CD19 + GL7 + Fas + B cells could be detected in all immunized groups, except for PBS, while the RBD group was associated with a significantly higher number of these B cells than that of the RBD9.1 group ( Figure 3C) . Also, immunofluorescent staining of the germinal center B-cell marker Peanut hemagglutinin (PNA) showed that it was expressed at high levels in the splenic B cells of mice immunized with RBD9.1, RBD, or HBV peptide ( Figure 3D ). In parallel, we detected the proportion of CD4 + CXCR5 + PD-1 + T follicular helper (Tfh) in the spleen of immunized mice. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that these Tfh cells were expanded with RBD9.1 injection at a level like that of the HBV group but markedly lower than that of the RBD group ( Figure 3E ). Collectively, these results confirmed that RBD9.1 can effectively activate the humoral immunity by promoting the formation of germinal centers in mouse spleen and exporting RBD-specific plasma cells.\n",
            " Since the antibody production from B cells requires the facilitation of CD4 + Tfh cells for antigenic recognition, we evaluated the CD4 + T-cell activation. Though higher than the PBS control, no apparent differences were observed for the expressions of CD25 and CD69 in the splenic CD4 + T cells among the RBD9.1, the HBV, or the adjuvant groups, suggesting that the induced CD4 + T-cell activation was an adjuvant effect (Supplementary Figures S4A, B) . Consistent with the level of the germinal center activation, the highest percentages of CD25 + or CD69 + CD4 + T cells were found to be from the RBDimmunized group ( Figures 4A, B) .\n",
            " To be noted, the sequence of RBD9.1 contains a 9-aa region (P45) that we have recently confirmed to be an HLA-A*24:02 CD8 + T-cell epitope (25) . Therefore, we suspected that the RBD9.1 antigenic peptide might induce a P45-specific T-cell response. We verified whether P45 could be presented by the Balb/c mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I molecules, which were mainly H2-Kd and H2-Dd, with H2-Ld to a lesser extent. Through the prediction by IEDB (http://www.iedb.org) and NetMHCpan software (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan/), it was shown that P45 could potentially bind to the mouse HLA molecules, especially H2-Kd and H2-Dd (data not shown). With this, we stimulated the splenocytes isolated from the immunized mice by the P45 peptide for 24 h and examined the expression of Tcell activation marker CD69 and CD137. Flow cytometric analysis showed that a higher amount of activated CD8 + T cells were detected in both the RBD and RBD9.1 groups, whereas no differences were found between the two groups of these antigenic peptides (Figures 4C, D and Supplementary Figures S5A, B ). In addition, the amounts of interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-g FIGURE 2 | Immunization with RBD9.1 antigenic peptide efficiently induced neutralizing antibody production in Balb/c mice.

Moreover, the levels of IL-2 and IFN-g in the serum of each immunized group were analyzed, and the results showed that both RBD and RBD9.1 could significantly enhance the production of these two cytokines relative to the HBV peptide or the PBS control ( Figures 4G, H) . Detailed study of the source of these cytokines by flow cytometry analysis revealed that IFN-g was predominantly secreted by CD8 + T cells, which was consistent with the P45-specific T-cell reactivity identified above ( Figure 4I and Supplementary Figures S6A, B) . Overall, these data indicated that the RBD9.1 antigenic peptide could induce both CD4 + T cell and the P45-specific CD8 + T-cell immune response.\n",
            " To evaluate whether RBD9.1 immunization could form longterm immune memory, we assessed the levels of memory B and T cells on Days 10, 94, and 165. Flow cytometry analysis of the memory B-cell marker CD27 showed that the proportion of CD19 + CD27 + B cells was significantly increased in all three immunized groups, compared to the PBS control, while the RBD group showed the highest level of elevation in memory B cells ( Figure 5A ). The enhanced CD19 + CD27 + B-cell percentages were shown to decrease over time, but they could still be detected at a late time point of 94 days ( Figure 5A ). Furthermore, we assessed the long-term production of the RBDspecific memory B cells. The results from the antibody-secreting cell (ASC) ELISPOT assay and the ELISA assay showed that both RBD and RBD9.1 could efficiently induce the production of RBD-specific IgG antibodies, with the former at a relatively higher level, in the supernatant after costimulation with R848 and mouse IL-2 for 6 days ( Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S7B ). There were no statistical differences between the levels of antibody productions of these two groups on the 10th and the 94th day, whereas sight reduction was observed in the in the immunized serum were detected by ELISA on the 10th day after the last immunization. The expression of IFN-g (gated on CD4 + or CD8 + T cells) was detected by flow cytometry on the 10th day after the last immunization. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001; ns, non-significant.\n",
            " number of RBD-specific IgG spots as well as the total antibody amounts after the last immunization on the 165th day ( Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure S7A) . Importantly, the presence of RBD9.1-specific memory B cells was associated with both the RBD and RBD9.1 groups at comparative levels, which were sustained over the period of the 94-day immunization course and decreased on Day 165 ( Figure 5D) .\n",
            " Moreover, the proportions of T-cell subgroups in the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells on Days 10 and 94 after the last immunization were assessed ( Figures 5E, F and Supplementary Figures S7C, D) . Compared with those of the other three groups, the percentages of Tn in CD8 + T cells in RBD group significantly decreased on Day 10, along with a significant increase in Te subpopulation. Compared with that of the PBS group, the percentages of Tn in , and Tcm (CD62L + CD44 + ) of CD8 + or CD4 + T cells on days 10 and 94 after the last immunization. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001; ns, non-significant.\n",
            " CD4 + T cells in all three groups significantly decreased on Day 10, while only the RBD group showed a significant increase in the Te subpopulation. No apparent changes were observed for the Tcm or Tem subgroups in CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in any immunized samples. On Day 94, the proportion of Tn and Tem in CD8 + did not alter in any sample. However, significantly higher Tcm proportions in CD8 + T cells were found in the RBD and RBD9.1 groups than that in the PBS group, which confirmed that RBD9.1 peptide promoted the information of CD8 + T-cell memory in mice after six rounds of immunization. This was accompanied by significantly reduced levels of Te of CD8 + T cells in the RBD, RBD9.1, and HBV groups compared with that of the PBS control. Meanwhile, it was observed that the percentages of Te in CD4 + T cells in the RBD, RBD9.1, and HBV groups all significantly decreased compared with the PBS control on Day 94. The level of Tcm was only found to be significantly increased in the RBD group, indicating that CD4 + T-cell memory might be specifically associated with RBD immunization. Together, these results demonstrated that RBD9.1 peptide could effectively establish long-term B-cell and T-cell immune memory.\n",
            " To verify the long-term protection with RBD9.1 immunization, an antibody titer follow-up study was performed. The results showed that the RBD-specific antibodies were still detectable 4 months post the last injection of RBD or RBD9.1, with the latter to a lower level ( Figure 6A) . Specifically, the RBD-blocking assay showed that the RBD-specific IgG antibodies from mouse sera 64 days post the last RBD9.1 immunization could block the interaction between RBD and hACE2 ( Figure 6B) . Also, flow cytometry analysis was performed with the splenocytes stimulated with RBD9.1 ex vivo. We found that both RBD and RBD9. T cells, indicated by the elevated percentages of the CD69 + CD8 + or CD137 + CD8 + T cells ( Figures 6C, D and Supplementary  Figures S8A, B) . Consistently, increased secretion of IFN-g and IL-2 was detected with both RBD9.1 and RBD stimulation 94 days after the last immunization ( Figures 6E, F) . These results suggested that RBD9.1 immunization might provide long-term protection with sustained levels of RBD-specific antibodies and functionally durable CD8 + T-cell responses.\n",
            " Currently, vaccination against COVID-19 has been promoted worldwide, although sustained protection against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variant strains has been continuously challenged (29, 30) . Therefore, a need for a vaccine candidate with cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 strains with enhanced infectivity is raised, especially for those with mutations in the RBM region and resistant to serum neutralization. In this study, we found that RBD9.1 could be widely recognized by COVID-19 convalescent serum, with higher affinity for those with elevated neutralizing potency. Importantly, the RBD9.1-immunized mouse sera exhibited sustained neutralizing capability against five of the currently dominant variant strains as the wild-type SARS-CoV-2, including B.1.617.2 that carried a point mutation within the sequence of RBD9.1 (S L452R ). Furthermore, we confirmed that the RBD9.1 antigenic peptide could induce a specific CD8 + T-cell response, as the sequence of RBD9.1 contained a previously identified T-cell epitope P45 (S 448-456 ). Together, we provided a potential vaccine candidate, with a unique functional mechanism of activating both humoral and cellular immunity, as well as a long-term protective efficacy over SARS-CoV-2 variant strains. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD has been a functional antigenic during the development of candidate vaccines for COVID-19 (31). However, undesired major immune responses have presented a great threat and largely limited its practical applications. The identification of the linear immunodominant RBD9.1 and the reactiveness of the sera from COVID-19 patients against it have confirmed that it might be an alternative expected to bypass certain limitations associated with the full length of RBD. Indeed, the serum from mice immunized with RBD9.1 contained a relatively lower proportion of RBD-specific non-neutralizing antibodies than that of the serum from RBD-immunized group. Reasonably, RBD9.1 is less effective than RBD in terms of the bulk of induced RBD-specific antibodies, which is largely due to the significant differences in the length and structural complexity between these antigenic peptides. Also, RBD9.1 could induce long-term protection of the body after immunization, even if the number of RBD-specific memory B cells is less than that of RBD. Independently, another study showed that a longer peptide with 46 aa (S 435-479 ) covering the sequences of RBD9.1 (S 444-463 ) could induce neutralizing protection in mice against authentic SARS-CoV-2 (32) . To be noted, the neutralization titers of these two peptides were almost identical in the RBD-hACE2-blocking assay or the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay (data not shown). These suggested that RBD9.1 might be of advanced practical value for the design of de novo peptide-based vaccines for COVID-19.\n",
            " As most of the currently available SARS-CoV-2 commercial vaccine products have been reported with significantly reduced neutralizing efficacy against mutant strains, public concern has risen for the post-vaccination protective outcome, particularly facing the global threat of B.1.617.2. In contrast to most reported vaccines, we found that the RBM mutations presented in five of the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant strains did not seem to challenge the neutralizing capability of the RBD9.1-immunized sera. This is largely because the sequence of RBD9.1 is a relatively conserved region within the RBM. Further characterization for the binding ability of the neutralizing antibodies revealed two key residues within RBD9.1, for which there was no reported variant strain with corresponding point mutations so far. Coincidentally, with B.1.617 and B.1.617.2 containing a close point mutation (S L452R ) in the RBD9.1 region, the immunized sera still exhibited effective neutralizing potency that was comparative to the wide type of the virus. Therefore, RBD9.1 may exhibit applicable importance with desirable protection from SARS-CoV-2, especially against mutant strains circulating at the current time. Majority of peptidebased vaccine products rely on the effective induction alone of humoral or cellular immune response post immunization (32) (33) (34) . We have identified a rare case with RBD9.1, which is a linear region that could both induce the production of neutralizing antibodies and activate the CD8 + cytotoxic T cells in immunized mice. Particularly, we have proven that the inclusion of the previously reported immunodominant HLA-A*24:02-restricted peptide P45 (NYNYLYRLF) in the sequence of RBD9.1 was positively associated with enhanced production of functional cytokines essential for the antiviral effects of CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes and the homologous assistance of CD4 + T lymphocytes (25, 35) . It is of great importance because SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be susceptible to cell-mediated immune responses, and COVID-19 patients who developed strong T-cell immunity are often correlated with mild symptoms. Therefore, RBD9.1-induced activation of cellular immunity in addition to humoral immunity might present a unique practical value during the development of COVID-19 vaccines. To be noted, although the point mutation S L452R in B.1.617.2 was recently shown to largely impede the cytotoxic effect of the P45-specific CD8 + T cells, we confirmed that the neutralizing efficacy of RBD9.1-immunized sera was not affected against the corresponding pseudoviruses. This indicated that amino acid residues that were fundamental for the recognition of CD8 + T-cell receptor (TCR) might be different from those essential for the binding of neutralizing antibodies, and vaccine candidates like RBD9.1 that could functionally activate duo immune responses might provide clinical significance for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis.\n",
            " One of the concerning side effects of COVID-19 vaccination was the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect (36, 37) . For example, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found to especially induce ADE effects when inoculated with mutant strains containing the D617G mutation, which was shared by all the newly emerged mutant strains. According to the strategic enlightenment of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) vaccine development, short length of the vaccine peptide and high amounts of induced antibodies with neutralizing capacity were the two most important factors correlated with a reduced risk of ADE. Containing only 20 aa, RBD9.1 was correlated with high levels of neutralizing antibodies not only from COVID-19 convalescent patient samples but also in the immunized mouse sera. These might greatly reduce the likelihood of RBD9.1 in generating high levels of ADE, although detailed comparative studies are still needed. Meanwhile, the relatively short length of RBD9.1 has presented ideal opportunities for beneficial modifications, including the conjugation of polypeptides or the addition of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + and/or CD8 + T-cell epitopes. Comprehensive preclinical evaluation of the immune response induced by RBD9.1 in advanced preclinical models, such as humanized ACE2 transgenic mice or rhesus monkeys, may provide valuable information for the evaluation and application of this vaccine candidate and is currently under study.\n",
            " In conclusion, we presented a potential SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine candidate RBD9.1, with duo functional activations of humoral and cellular immunity, as well as generating long-term protective efficacy over SARS-CoV-2 variant strains. Our study provided practical information for the advancement of prophylaxis against COVID-19, especially with the currently circulating mainstream SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains.\n",

            " hosts without a major role in virus spread. In contrast, there is circumstantial evidence that biting insects are a major virus reservoir and vectors of disease in animals. Many vesiculoviruses have been recovered in nature from bloodsucking insects [17, 102, 107, 109] and bite transmission of VSV IND and Chandipura to laboratory animals by experimentally infected mosquitoes and sandflies has been demonstrated [6, 46, 80, 103, 105, 109] . In addition, natural infection has occurred in sentinel animals exposed in areas of known virus activity [47, 104] . The hypothesis that insects are the major VSV reservoir is further supported by the demonstration of vertical transmission in experimentally infected sand flies that, in nature, would allow virus to propagate and persist in insect populations without the need of an intermediate host [103, 106, 110] .\n",
            " VSV infection in humans is rare, but it can occur when animal handlers and veterinarians come in close contact with infected livestock and through inadvertent exposure of laboratory personnel [24, 42] . The most common portals of infection in humans are skin and mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, and eyes, although there is also serological evidence that suggests that some vesiculoviruses may be directly transmitted to humans through insect bites [7, 12, 47] . Human infection with VSV can either be asymptomatic or may lead to disease symptoms, which include myalgia, headache, and fever that resolve in 3-5 days without complications.\n",
            " The standard VSV particle is bullet-shaped (65×180 nm), comprising a ribonucleoprotein core surrounded by a lipid envelope that is derived from host cell plasma membrane. The virus genome is an ∼11-kilobase single strand of negative-sense RNA encoding five major viral proteins (Fig. 1 ). The N protein is the most abundant virus protein expressed in infected cells and associates closely with genomic RNA to form viral nucleocapsid, which is the functional template for both viral transcription and replication [115] . The P and L proteins associate to form the functional viral RNA polymerase that performs both transcriptase and replicase functions [21, 74, 113] . The M protein is the most abundant protein in the virus particle and has multiple functions in the infected cell, including virus budding, inhibition of host cell gene expression [2, 8, 41, 54] , and regulation of viral transcription [13, 15] . The G protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that forms trimeric spike-like structures on the virus surface [40, 55, 83, 118] , and facilitates virus attachment to host cell receptors and uptake by endocytosis. At pH <6 the G protein undergoes a conformational change resulting in the fusion of viral envelope with the membrane of endosomal vesicles [30] , releasing viral nucleocapsid and viral RNA polymerase into the host cell cytoplasm to initiate the replicative cycle.\n",
            " After engaging the unique transcription promoter at the 3′-end of the nucleocapsid template, the RNA polymerase initiates mRNA transcription and proceeds toward the genome 5′-end, terminating and reinitiating transcription at each gene junction, resulting in the production of five discreet viral mRNAs (VmRNAs) [1, 4, 39] . During this process the transcriptase complex occasionally detaches from the nucleocapsid template at intergenic junctions and must return to the 3′ promoter to reinitiate transcription, which results in a pronounced 3′ to 5′ gradient of VmRNA expression (Fig. 2) . This transcription gradient allows the virus to express individual proteins at optimal levels for viral replication. For example, the L gene encoding the viral RNA polymerase, which is a catalytic protein needed in relatively small amounts, is distal to the 3′ transcription promoter and is transcribed with low efficiency in infected cells. Conversely, the N gene encoding a major structural protein, which is required in abundance for nucleocapsid formation, is immediately adjacent to the 3′ transcription promoter and is efficiently transcribed [112] .\n",
            " Some time after initiation of primary mRNA transcription, genome replication also begins. The mechanism responsible for switching RNA polymerase from a transcription to a replication mode is not fully understood, although a number of hypotheses have been proposed [3, 9, 10, 16, 73] . The nucleocapsid is also the functional template for genome replication as it is for transcription. The viral replicase initiates RNA synthesis at the exact genome 3′-end and proceeds to the 5′-end, ignoring transcription stop and start signals to produce a full-length positive sense copy of the viral genome. Nascent positiveand negative-sense genomic RNA is encapsidated with N protein in a cooperative, coreplicational manner [10, 59] , and the resulting ribonucleprotein complex subsequently functions as a template for further genome amplification and mRNA transcription. The increased availability of amplified viral genome templates for secondary transcription leads to a rapid increase in the abundance of all viral proteins needed for mature virus particle production.\n",
            " The virus assembly process is not understood completely, but available data indicate that viral nucleocapsid associates with regions of the plasma membrane enriched with M and G proteins. The nucleocapsid then condenses into a form that is transcriptionally inactive, and in a process that appears to be primarily driven by the M protein [36, 48] , the plasma membrane containing G protein envelops the underlying viral nucleocapsid and mature virus particles bud from the cell surface. The G protein cytoplasmic tail (CT) does not appear to have an essential role in virus budding [85] , but does enhance efficiency of the process [97, 98] . The mature virus particles contain the viral RNA polymerase necessary for further propagation in susceptible cells.\n",
            " Until recently, directed manipulation of the VSV genome was impossible due to the instability of single-stranded RNA and difficulties in defining conditions that would allow recovery of infectious virus from genomic cDNA. However, as a result of pioneering work carried out in a number of laboratories, a recovery process known as \"virus rescue,\" was developed approximately 10 years ago [57, 95, 116] . The rescue procedure involves the transfection of susceptible cells with plasmids expressing the virus N, P, and L proteins and a full-length positive sense genomic RNA (Fig. 3) . The N, P, and L proteins associate with the nascent genomic RNA to initiate virus replication and transcription, producing infectious virus progeny. The ability to rescue VSV from cloned cDNA has allowed fundamental questions on virus replication to be addressed, and has also enabled the rational design and development of recombinant VSV (rVSV) as a vaccine vector [27, 34, 35, 84, 85, 88, 89, 114] .\n",
            " There are many aspects of VSV biology that support the development of rVSV vaccine vectors for the treatment and prevention of human disease. The virus genome is simply organized into discreet transcriptional units (TUs) for expression of viral proteins, and nucleotide signal sequences Fig. 1 VSV genome organization, particle structure, and morphology. a The VSV genome encodes five major viral proteins, expressed from five discreet TUs. A single 3′ transcription promoter and genome replication promoter reside within the 50-nucleotide-long leader sequence. The antigenome replication promoter resides within the 59-nucleotidelong trailer sequence. Consensus transcription start and stop signals at the beginning and end of each TU, respectively, result in the synthesis of five VmRNAs. Genome replication occurs through a positive-sense antigenome intermediate. b The VSV particle is bullet-shaped, containing a ribonucleoprotein core surrounded by a lipid envelope that is derived from host cell plasma membrane. The N protein is closely associated with genomic RNA forming viral nucleocapsid. Viral RNA polymerase comprises a complex between the P and L proteins and is packaged inside the virus particle. G protein trimers form spike-like projections from the viral envelope that attach the virus particle to host cell receptors. The electron micrograph shows VSV particles stained with phosphotungstic acid (reprinted with permission from Rose and Whitt [87]) involved in the control of viral gene expression have been defined [96] . Accordingly, one or more additional TUs encoding foreign proteins can be added to the VSV genome and robustly expressed under control of the 3′ transcription promoter [82, 84, 85, 89] . Furthermore, the abundance of foreign protein expression can be modulated depending on proximity of the extra TUs relative to the 3′ transcription promoter (unpublished data) [72] . Although the mutation frequency of VSV is high [18, 37] and additional foreign genes are not essential for virus replication, the consensus sequence of foreign protein open reading frames (ORFs) can be maintained over many rounds of amplification [96] , ensuring preservation of target antigens during the vaccine manufacturing process. The ability of rVSV vaccine vectors to propagate vigorously in qualified continuous cell lines also facilitates industrial scale manufacture of vaccine preparations.\n",
            " Because human infection is rare, VSV seroprevalence in the general population is very low; therefore, preexisting immunity will not likely be a factor affecting the efficacy of future rVSV vaccine vectors, as may be the case for some other proposed viral vaccine vectors [14, 61] . Indeed, the existence of many different vesiculovirus serotypes may be exploited to design multiple rVSV vaccine vectors [88] for prevention and treatment of many different diseases. VSV does not cause any obvious signs of disease after parenteral administration to either livestock or nonhuman primates (NHPs) [89] , and rVSV vectors are anticipated to be innocuous in humans when administered parenterally. Other desirable safety features include the lack of a DNA intermediate during viral replication and the cytoplasmic site of genome replication, both of which reduce the likelihood of viral nucleic acid integration into host cell DNA. Furthermore, vector genome stability is enhanced because it is encapsidated and cannot undergo recombination. Fig. 2 The VSV mRNA transcription gradient. Genes proximal to the 3′ transcription promoter are transcribed more abundantly than 5′ proximal genes. The gradient of mRNA transcription arises because the RNA polymerase complex often detaches from the template at intergenic junctions and can only reinitiate transcription at the 3′ transcription promoter Fig. 3 Rescue of rVSV from genomic cDNA. Virus rescue is initiated by cotransfecting plasmids (step 1) encoding the full-length viral genome and transacting viral polypeptides. T7 RNA polymerase, introduced into the cell by a variety of different methods, mediates RNA synthesis in the cell cytoplasm during the earliest stages of rescue, producing copies of the viral genomic RNA and transcripts encoding the transacting polypeptides (N, P, and L) needed to promote de novo assembly of a nucleocapsid (step 2). Functional nucleocapsid subsequently serves as a template for genome replication, transcription of all VmRNAs, and accumulation of viral proteins (steps 3-5) triggering ensuing events in the viral replication cycle including virus assembly (step 6) and budding (step 7) In the prototypic rVSV vectors, foreign genes were expressed from a TU inserted at position 5 in the viral genome ( Fig. 4 ) between the G and L genes [49, 84, 85, 89] . This insertion site was chosen to minimally perturb the stoichiometry of viral protein expression, which is modulated by distance of each gene from the 3′ transcription promoter. Because the L protein has a catalytic function, displacing the L gene by one additional TU from the 3′ promoter was viewed as a conservative genome alteration that should not adversely affect viral replication, while allowing adequate foreign protein expression to generate an immune response. This rationale was supported by in vitro growth studies showing only minimal reduction in peak virus titers for vectors containing an extra foreign gene between the G and L genes [22, 85] . Furthermore, the level of foreign protein expression was sufficient to elicit robust antigen-specific immune responses after a single inoculation of mice and rabbits [82, 84, 85] . In some cases, primary immune responses could be further boosted with a second dose of homologous vaccine 1 to 2 months later [82, 85] . However, because durable neutralizing antibodies are usually elicited against the VSV surface glycoprotein after a single vaccination with replication-competent rVSV vectors, glycoprotein exchange vectors were designed to allow more effective boosting of immune responses to target antigens. The exchange vectors were generated by switching the IND serotype G gene in priming vectors with either the VSV NJ or Chandipura serotype G gene in boosting vectors [88] .\n",
            " In view of the flexibility of the rVSV vector platform and the encouraging data from preclinical studies with experimental influenza vaccines [84, 85] , rVSV vectors expressing antigens from a variety of other human pathogens were developed and tested in preclinical animal challenge models (Table 1) . Other vectors expressing antigens from hepatitis C virus (HCV) [22] , hantavirus [58] , and mycobacterium tuberculosis [117] were assessed in preclinical immunogenicity studies.\n",
            " The first NHP experiments to evaluate rVSV as a vector system for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were conducted by Dr. John Rose and colleagues at Yale. In these pioneering studies, rhesus macaques were immunized with a combination of two prototypic rVSV vectors expressing a HIV-1 89.6 Env gp160/VSV-G fusion polypeptide and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag p55 protein. Vaccine vector administration by a combination of intramuscular and intranasal routes clearly demonstrated the ability of rVSV vectors to elicit potent antigen-specific cellmediated immune responses in NHPs. In addition, this study also clearly demonstrated for the first time the ability of rVSV vectors expressing Env and Gag proteins to provide highly significant protection from AIDS after an intravenous heterologous SIV/HIV (SHIV) 89 .6P challenge [89] . In this study, all seven macaques receiving rVSV expressing HIVenv and SIVgag remained disease-free after SHIV 89.6P challenge for >4 years ( [89] and J. Rose, personal communication). By comparison, all eight control macaques [either unimmunized or immunized with labadapted rVSV expressing influenza hemagglutinin (HA)] progressed to AIDS with an average time of 8 months ( [89] and J. Rose, personal communication). The protection from AIDS in this study correlated with large differences in peak viral loads, low or undetectable viral loads at set point, and with the preservation of CD4 + T cells in the vaccinees relative to controls. This encouraging level of postchallenge vaccine efficacy suggested that rVSV vectors expressing HIV genes might be an effective AIDS vaccine in humans.\n",
            " In addition to demonstrating postchallenge efficacy in NHPs, rVSV-based vaccines have other advantages that suggest they may be ideally suited for development as a worldwide prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine. Most notably, rVSV-based vaccine vectors, at least in animal models, can be safely and effectively administered via a mucosal route as shown in several animal models. For example, a single intranasal inoculation with an rVSV vector expressing the influenza virus HA protein in mice [84, 85] , the herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 glycoprotein D in mice [69] , or a measles virus HA protein in cotton rats [94] completely protected animals against mucosal challenge with the corresponding wild-type pathogen. Recently, our laboratory systematically compared the immunogenicity of rVSV vaccine vectors when given either as an intramuscular or intranasal inoculation in an effort to determine which route of vaccine administration was optimal for inducing humoral and cellular immune responses in rhesus macaques [19] . Our results demonstrated that Mamu-A*01 + MHC class I-positive macaques, vaccinated with a combination of \n",
            " Studies have not yet been conducted that directly evaluate the safety of rVSV vectors when administered to humans. As mentioned previously, infection with field isolates and cell culture-adapted VSV was not associated with significant illness in humans. Furthermore, in the course of numerous immunogenicity and safety studies performed at Wyeth (unpublished data), more than 150 NHPs were inoculated either intranasally or intramuscularly with high doses (10 7 plaque-forming units) of cell culture-adapted VSV and a variety of rVSV vectors without adverse effects. Animals maintained normal blood chemistry, blood cell count, and body weights after inoculation with virus, and showed no signs of the characteristic vesicular lesions observed in nasal and lingual epithelia.\n",
            " Although the studies described above indicated that rVSV vaccine vectors could be administered safely to humans, additional safety studies would be required before proceeding with clinical studies. Replication-competent viral vaccines have historically been subjected to stringent safety testing including direct inoculation of virus into the central nervous system of susceptible NHPs to measure neurovirulence (NV) potential [60, 68, 91, 99] . Although the rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vectors described above are attenuated relative to VSV field isolates, they are replica-tion-competent and subject to the same stringent safety testing used for other live attenuated vaccine viruses. For this reason, the prototypic rVSV vector and a number of closely related rVSV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag protein were tested in an exploratory NHP NV study. This study was also warranted by historical data showing that VSV field isolates and tissue culture-adapted VSV strains were neurotrophic and neurovirulent in rodents [81, 92, 111] , and that VSV serially passaged in mouse brain was found to be neurovirulent in livestock and NHPs inoculated by the intracranial route [29, 70] .\n",
            " The NV potential of rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vectors was tested by direct intrathalamic inoculation of cynomolgus macaques in accordance with the procedures used to assess production lots of mumps virus vaccine [65, 91] . The results of this exploratory study showed that the prototypic rVSV vector expressing HIV-1 Gag was much more attenuated than cell culture-adapted wild-type VSV, but retained a level of residual NV that would likely be unacceptable to regulatory agencies (J. Erik Johnson et al., submitted for publication).\n",
            " To address the safety concerns raised by the outcome of the exploratory NHP NV study, a variety of distinctive strategies were investigated to further attenuate growth and virulence of rVSV vectors. Multiple approaches were pursued because it was impossible to predict which attenuation strategy would provide an optimal balance between safety and immunogenicity.\n",
            " The ability to attenuate in vitro growth and virulence of rVSV by moving the N gene from the first position in the genome to downstream locations was clearly demonstrated [27, 28, 112] . The step-wise translocation of the N gene further away from the 3′ transcription promoter leads to incremental reduction in N protein expression, thereby limiting nucleocapsid formation (Figs. 2 and 5). Because nucleocapsid is the functional template for mRNA transcription and genome replication and is part of the virion core, limiting nucleocapsid leads to a decrease in viral protein synthesis, genome amplification, and formation of mature virus particles. In addition to providing a means of attenuating rVSV vectors incrementally, another attractive feature of this attenuation strategy is the known genetic stability of N gene translocations [4, 27] , which greatly eliminates the likelihood of reversion. Truncation of the CT region of G protein was also used to attenuate in vitro growth and in vivo virulence of rVSV vectors [85, 98] . The wild-type G protein CT region is 29 amino acids in length. However, when the CT was truncated to either one or nine amino acids (CT1 and CT9, respectively) ( Fig. 6) , peak virus titers obtained in cell culture were reduced, and the resulting viruses were less pathogenic in mice after intranasal inoculation [85, 98] . The attenuation mechanism likely involves an impaired interaction between the viral ribonucleoprotein core and the truncated G protein CTs during viral morphogenesis [66, 71, 98] , leading to a reduction in the efficiency of virus particle assembly. As seen for N gene translocation, G protein CT truncation also gives rise to virus with a very stable attenuation phenotype because replacement of deleted sequence encoding part of a protein is very improbable.\n",
            " The VSV M protein plays a key role in the development of virus induced cell cytopathology and cell death [2, 8, 54] . Mutations in the rVSV M gene that delay and diminish cytopathic effect in infected cells were described [41] . These mutations ablate the expression of two overlapping, in-frame polypeptides that are expressed from the M protein mRNA by initiation of protein synthesis at internal AUGs (Fig. 7) . Both polypeptides may have a role in the development of cell cytopathology by inhibiting nuclear export of cellular mRNA and disruption of the cell cytoskeleton [23, 41, 91] . These M gene mutants are also much less pathogenic in mice (unpublished data).\n",
            " Historically, VSV temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants were isolated either as a result of random point mutation or, more commonly, after chemical mutagenesis [26, 76, 77] . These conditional mutants usually propagate robustly at a permissive temperature and poorly or not at all at a defined nonpermissive temperature. Because the temperature of nasal epithelium is typically lower than core body temperature, selective incorporation of ts mutations should produce rVSV vectors that replicate vigorously at 32-35°C but not at 37°C, and serve as vectors for intranasal Step-wise translocation of the N gene further away from the 3′ transcription promoter leads to incremental attenuation of virus growth in vitro and in vivo. This method of attenuation relies on downregulation of N protein expression due to the 3′ to 5′ transcription gradient Fig. 6 Attenuation of rVSV by G protein truncation. Truncation of the CT region of the rVSV G protein from 29 amino acids to either nine (CT9) or one (CT1) amino acids progressively attenuates virus growth in vitro and in vivo. It is believed that viral morphogenesis is adversely affected due to impaired interaction between shorter CTs and underlying viral core proteins (Fig. 7b) . The molecular mechanism of ts attenuation is often not clearly defined but probably involves impaired protein folding and instability at the nonpermissive temperature.\n",
            " In case replication-competent rVSV vectors prove to be inadequately attenuated for use in humans, propagationincompetent rVSV vectors are also being developed. These vectors are restricted to a single round of replication and are unable to spread beyond primary infected cells. One such vector has the entire G gene deleted (ΔG), and therefore requires G protein transcomplementation for propagation of infectious virus particles in vitro (Fig. 8 ) [85] . Another related vector has most of the G protein ectodomain deleted (G stem), retaining the CT region, transmembrane domain, and 42 amino acids of the membrane proximal ectodomain (Fig. 8) . This vector is also propagation-defective, requiring G protein in trans for production of infectious particles in vitro. Expression of the truncated form of G protein (G stem) enhances the overall yield of progeny virus particles in vitro compared to vectors with the entire G gene deleted, perhaps due to increased concentration of G protein CTs at the cell plasma membrane, facilitating virus assembly and budding [86] . Although propagation-defective virus offers obvious safety advantages, difficulties in providing adequate quantities of complementing G protein to allow efficient vector amplification during industrial scale manufacture are a possible limitation.\n",
            " The above strategies gave rise to rVSV vectors showing a range of growth attenuation in vitro and a marked reduction in pathogenicity after intranasal inoculation of mice [77, 85, 86, 114] . However, some vectors still displayed levels of NV that were almost equivalent to unaltered prototypic rVSV vector after intracranial inoculation of mice [28, 77, 114] . In addition, one of the attenuated vectors containing a G protein CT truncation that was highly attenuated in vitro and after intranasal inoculation of mice still caused moderate levels of neuropathology in the NHP NV model (J. Erik Johnson et al., submitted for publication). These observations indicated that the previously described attenuation strategies might not be sufficient to reduce rVSV vector NV in animal models to a level that would be acceptable to regulatory agencies. Therefore, additional strategies to further attenuate rVSV vectors are being explored, including combinations of CT truncations with either N gene rearrangements or Mncp mutations (Fig. 9) . It was thought that these mutation combinations would increase vector attenuation beyond levels obtained using single attenuation strategies. Other types of gene rearrangement, including M and G gene shuffling, singly and in combination, are also under investigation [5, 25] . Specific combinations of ts mutations are also being developed in an effort to ensure tight shut-off of viral replication at the nonpermissive temperature while retaining high levels of transcriptional activity (Fig. 9) .\n",
            " As with other attenuated rVSV vectors, plaque size and one-step growth kinetics will serve as an initial measure of replication efficiency of further attenuated combination mutants. Those vectors showing significant growth attenuation in vitro will then be tested for NV in mice after intracranial inoculation. This route of inoculation was chosen because significant differences in virulence between highly attenuated vectors are often not apparent after Future approaches to rVSV attenuation. Combination of attenuation strategies may further extend the range of attenuated rVSV vectors to be tested to achieve an optimum balance of safety and immunogenicity. N gene shuffles may be combined with either G protein CT truncations or Mncp mutations. Other individual gene translocations (M and G) may, on their own and in combination with other attenuation strategies, provide an optimal attenuation phenotype. Novel combinations of ts mutations may also produce rVSV vectors that can replicate well at 34-35°C, but not at core body temperature, and may be suited to intranasal vaccine delivery intranasal inoculation, but can be measured after intracranial inoculation due to the exquisite sensitivity to VSV infection by this route [38, 67, 75, 81, 114] . The resulting mortality and morbidity can be used to calculate a 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) for each vector, and these data will then be used to define a rank order of vector attenuation.\n",
            " Although the murine NV model is tractable and provides a very sensitive means of ranking rVSV vector NV, additional NV studies also will be carried out in ferrets and NHPs to further evaluate vector safety. Ferrets were used as a disease model to study influenza virus because they are naturally susceptible to infection and display many of the disease symptoms seen in humans [63, 64, 90, 93, 100] . A ferret NV model was recently developed because components of the influenza virus particle can induce significant neuropathology in NHPs after intracranial inoculation in the absence of viral replication (unpublished data). Because the ferret NV model might be a better indicator of NV and neurotropism potential in NHPs and humans, rVSV vector safety also will be assessed after intranasal and intracranial inoculation of ferrets. In the absence of a clearly defined marker of ferret NV (LD 50 ), changes in brain histopathology profiles will be used to assess the extent of injury associated with each rVSV vector.\n",
            " Data from murine NV and immunogenicity studies and ferret NV studies will then be used to identify the most promising candidate vectors for further NV testing in NHPs. These studies will be performed as before for the prototypic rVSV vectors. For the NHP NV studies, UVinactivated rVSV will be used as a control to measure baseline pathology resulting from the injection procedure and potential injurious effects of viral components in the inoculum. These controls are important in stringent NV testing of novel replication-competent vaccine candidates because injection of even the most innocuous material directly into the brain can lead to cell necrosis around the needle track and low-level inflammatory responses throughout the CNS.\n",
            " Typically, the two major types of injury resulting from intrathalamic inoculation of replication-competent virus are inflammatory responses stimulated by the presence of foreign material in the brain, mediated by cytokines and infiltrating leukocytes, and tissue necrosis resulting from cell death caused by viral replication. More specifically, the distinction between neuronal necrosis and inflammatory responses is important because neuronal cell necrosis is thought to be an irreversible process resulting in permanent neurological deficit, while inflammatory responses typically resolve over time, usually without permanent sequelae. Therefore, rVSV vectors that produce only minimal to mild inflammatory responses in the brain would be strongly favored over those causing necrotic lesions. If, as expected, some of the further attenuated rVSV vectors currently under development cause only very minimal inflammatory responses in the NHP CNS after intrathalamic inoculation and retain HIV-1-specific immunogenicity, then one or more of these vectors will be considered for future clinical evaluation.\n",
            " As rVSV vectors are further attenuated to enhance their safety, additional measures to maintain or increase immunogenicity may be required. The relative flexibility of the rVSV vector system and its relative ease of genetic manipulation allow for potential improvements in the immunogenicity of these vectors. There are several approaches that can be exploited to increase immunogenicity, including enhancement of foreign antigen expression, reduction of antivector immunity, coexpression of cytokines or immunomodulators, in vivo targeting of dendritic cells, and heterologous prime/boost vaccination regimens.\n",
            " Ideally, viral vectors used as vaccines can be rationally designed such that immunogenicity can be directed away from vector-specific antigens and toward the expressed foreign antigen, thereby maximizing immunogenicity of the target antigen and minimizing immunogenicity of the vector antigens. Antivector immunity can limit the ability to boost responses, and may limit the use of the same vector backbone for several vaccine targets. This might be especially relevant to immunotherapeutic approaches for persistent infections such as HIV, HSV, and HCV where repetitive boosting may be required to control infection.\n",
            " One potential approach to shift the focus of the immune response toward the expressed foreign antigen and away from VSV antigens is to take advantage of the transcriptional gradient of VSV described earlier. The prototype rVSV vectors developed by Rose et al. [89] positioned the gene expressing the foreign antigen toward the 5′-end of the viral genome. This was done to promote efficient rescue from cDNA and maintain viral replicative fitness. However, due to the 3′ to 5′ transcription gradient, positioning the foreign gene toward the 5′-end of the genome reduces the expression of the foreign antigen, relative to the four VSV 3′ proximal gene products. Therefore, future rVSV vectors will be designed with the foreign antigen gene at the 3′-end of the VSV genome (position 1), thereby maximizing the expression of the foreign antigen. Positioning the foreign gene in the first position in the genome should also have an attenuating effect on virus growth as all viral genes will be translocated further away from the 3′ transcription promoter, reducing their expression.\n",
            " One potential limitation of viral vectors is preexisting immunity to the vector. In addition, the primary immune response to the vector often limits the effectiveness of subsequent booster immunizations. In both small animal models and NHPs, a strong serotype-specific neutralizing antibody response is generated against the G protein of VSV after a single inoculation. The presence of these neutralizing antibodies precludes using the identical rVSV vector as a boosting vector in animals and will presumably have the same effect after vaccination in humans. To circumvent neutralizing antibodies and create vectors for boosting, Rose et al. [88] developed rVSV glycoprotein exchange vectors that encode the N, P, M, and L genes of the VSV IND serotype, but have the gene expressing the VSV IND serotype G protein substituted with either the gene expressing the VSV NJ serotype G protein or the gene for the G protein of the related Vesiculovirus Chandipura virus [88] . While these glycoprotein exchange vectors circumvent the neutralizing antibody response to the G protein, it is possible that T cell responses to the N, P, M, and L proteins might restrict virus replication and limit the ability of these vectors to boost responses. Generation of a complete rVSV NJ serotype vector was not attempted due to the potential for cross-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses between IND and NJ VSV serotypes. However, there are additional viruses in the Vesiculovirus genus that could be used to supply G genes for future rVSV G protein exchange vectors if multiple boosting vectors are desired. Attachment glycoprotein exchange of this manner does introduce a new gene into the vector, may alter the vector phenotype, and therefore careful safety testing must be conducted before advancing these vectors to clinical trials.\n",
            " While changing the rVSV serotype may provide the ability to boost with related vectors, more robust boosting may be possible with completely heterologous viral vectors or nonviral delivery systems such as plasmid DNA, protein subunit, or bacterial vectors. Studies in mice conducted with vectors expressing HIV Env or Gag showed that boosting rVSV-primed animals with vaccinia-based vectors produced a fivefold increase in peak HIV-specific CD8 + T cell responses relative to mice boosted with rVSV glycoprotein exchange vectors [35] . As a follow up study, Ramsburg et al. [78] compared the effectiveness of a single prime-boost immunization regimen in macaques consisting of lab-adapted G protein exchange VSV vectors expressing SHIV env, gag, and pol proteins to that of a protocol consisting of a lab-adapted rVSV vector prime followed by a single boost with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the same SHIV proteins. The macaques primed with a rVSV vectors expressing SHIV proteins and boosted once with a MVA vector expressing SHIV proteins mounted increased immune responses relative to animals boosted with VSV exchange vectors; however, due to the small numbers of macaques in each group, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Nevertheless, after intravenous SHIV 89.6P challenge, MVA-boosted macaques demonstrated a further 1 log 10 reduction in peak viral loads, cleared challenge virus faster, and preserved CD4 + -T cell counts to a greater extent than macaques receiving VSV G protein exchange vectors. Collectively, these data suggest that while G protein exchange rVSV vectors can circumvent VSV-specific neutralizing antibody and boost vaccinespecific immune responses, vaccine-specific immunogenicity and efficacy are substantially improved by boosting with a heterologous viral vector.\n",
            " Recently, we demonstrated that priming with a series of intramuscular injections of plasmid DNA encoding interleukin-12 (IL-12) and SIVgag effectively enhanced the immunogenicity and postchallenge efficacy of two intranasal doses of rVSV expressing HIVenv and SIVgag in rhesus macaques [20] . The results demonstrated that the plasmid DNA priming vaccination regimen significantly increased SIVgag-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, and significantly lowered viral loads post-SHIV 89.6P challenge relative to macaques receiving only the rVSV vectored immunizations. The addition of the plasmid DNA priming regimen also tended to increase the preservation of peripheral blood CD4 + cells and reduce the incidence of AIDS-like disease symptoms and death associated with SHIV 89.6P infection, although this did not achieve statistical significance due to the relatively small number of macaques used per group.\n",
            " An analysis of immune correlates of protection after SHIV 89.6P challenge revealed that the SHIV-specific IFN-γ ELISPOT responses elicited by vaccination correlated with postchallenge clinical outcome. Thus, the higher SHIVspecific cell-mediated immune responses elicited by the DNA prime/rVSV boost vaccination regimen was associated with an increased maintenance of CD4 + cells and a reduction in plasma SHIV viral loads. When the rVSV HIV-1envG/ SIVgag vaccines were given alone, substantially lower SHIV-specific cell-mediated immune responses were elicited and the postchallenge protection afforded by immunization was reduced.\n",
            " Once vectors based on rVSV and other platforms have demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials, it will be important to assess their combined use in heterologous prime/boost vaccination regimens to maximize their potential.\n",
            " There may be additional benefit gained by creating rVSV vectors expressing heterologous viral attachment glycoproteins. In the effort to use rVSV as a vaccine vector for human diseases, many groups have either replaced the VSV G protein or coexpressed it with glycoproteins from targeted human pathogens including hantavirus [ [32, 33] . When tested in animal models, these vectors elicited immune responses directed against the expressed foreign glycoproteins. More recently, NHPs immunized with rVSV vectors expressing glycoproteins from either Marburg or Ebola viruses were protected from disease after challenge with these pathogens [44] . Moreover, it is likely that replacing the VSV G protein with filoviruses glycoproteins altered rVSV vector tissue tropism such that they could readily target dendritic cells, as filoviruses are known to do. Such retargeted rVSV vectors could be designed to express additional foreign antigens from unrelated pathogens and serve as either priming or boosting vectors along with rVSV IND and NJ serotype vectors. Because retargeting by glycoprotein exchange can markedly alter virus phenotype and cell tropism, any new rVSV vector of this type will require extensive safety studies before clinical assessment.\n",
            " One advantage of using viral vectors as vaccines is that they are believed to act as their own adjuvant by stimulating the innate immune response through the binding of viral components to pathogen recognition receptors of the host cells. Specifically, VSV singlestranded RNA is believed to bind Toll-like receptor-7 in infected plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and is essential to the initiation of a type I IFN response and other innate responses [62] . Furthermore, the ribonucleoprotein complex of VSV was shown to activate cellular kinases TBK1 and IKKɛ that are involved in the production of type I IFNs [101] . In spite of this adjuvant activity of VSV, and because rVSV vectors will need to be further attenuated, it may be helpful to enhance their immunogenicity through the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, or the coadministration of small molecule adjuvants and immunomodulators.\n",
            " Several rVSV vectors have already been generated that express various cytokines. While most of these vectors have had a weak adjuvant effect, positive results from rVSV vectors expressing IL-12 [52, 53] or granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [79] have been reported. IL-12 is a proinflammatory cytokine expressed by antigen-presenting cells as a heterodimer, and drives the development of Th1-like responses. The ORF for an IL-12 fusion protein was inserted into a replication-restricted rVSV vector lacking the gene for the G protein (VSVΔG-IL12F) [52] . When VSVΔG-IL12F was coadministered with a weakly antigenic listerial antigen, enhanced Th1-polarized T cell responses (determined by listerial-specific IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion) and B cell responses (determined by listeria-specific IgG titers) were generated in mice. Moreover, coadministration of VSVΔG-IL12F and listerial antigen conferred protection from a lethal intraperitoneal listerial challenge [53] .\n",
            " GM-CSF recruits and activates antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. An rVSV vector expressing murine GM-CSF from the first position in the viral genome (VSV-GMCSF1) was shown to attenuate viral pathogenesis in mice, while retaining an immune response to the N protein of VSV [79] . Memory responses to VSV N were also slightly enhanced in mice immunized with VSV-GMCSF1 compared to VSV N responses in mice immunized with rVSV expressing green fluorescent protein. It is still to be determined how coadministration of VSV-GMCSF1 along with a rVSV vector expressing a foreign antigen will modulate the response to that antigen.\n",
            " The development of procedures for the recovery of viruses in the order Mononegavirales from genomic cDNA has created the opportunity to utilize this group of viruses as vaccine vectors for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of human diseases. VSV is one of the most-studied of the nonsegmented negative strand RNA viruses and is foremost among potential vaccine vectors in this group of viruses. VSV is naturally found in insects and livestock, is not considered a human pathogen, and has a very low seroprevalence in human populations. The small, simply organized viral genome can be altered to stably express one or more foreign proteins, and the resulting viral vectors can be amplified to high a titer in approved cell lines. The virus has a very broad host range and rVSV vector serotype can be changed simply by switching the surface glycoprotein with that from other vesiculovirus serotypes. VSV replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells, does not persist in vivo, and viral nucleic acid does not integrate into host genomic DNA. These desirable properties have led to the development of rVSV as a potential HIV-1 vaccine vector.\n",
            " Signs of VSV infection in livestock are usually restricted to the occurrence of vesicular lesions around the mouth, nose, teats, and coronary bands of the hooves that typically resolve in 7-10 days without serious consequence. However, historical data showed that VSV could be lethal in mice, and was neurovirulent when injected directly into the brain of mice, livestock, and NHPs. Therefore, to investigate the potential neurotropism and NV of prototypic rVSV/ HIV-1 vaccine vectors, exploratory NV testing in NHPs was carried out. The results of these tests indicated that the prototypic rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vectors required further attenuation before clinical evaluation. A variety of different attenuation strategies and combinations thereof are being evaluated to define a more acceptable attenuation phenotype. A very sensitive mouse LD 50 NV model can be used to rank order rVSV vector attenuation level. Vectors that cause minimal morbidity and mortality in the mouse model will then be further tested in ferret and NHP NV models to assess residual vector virulence. Vectors that cause only a minimal degree of neuropathology will be targeted for clinical evaluation.\n",
            " Balancing satisfactory levels of safety with adequate immunogenicity of further attenuated rVSV vectors will be challenging. However, upregulation of HIV-1 antigen expression, through gene positioning effects, may enhance immunogenicity and compensate for increased attenuation of virus replicative ability. Coexpression of molecular adjuvants by rVSV vectors may further improve antigenicity of HIV-1 proteins. The combination of rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vectors with other HIV-1 vaccine vectors, including plasmid DNA, in heterologous prime-boost regimens also provides another promising approach to enhance HIV-1specific immune responses. \n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Experimental SARS-CoV-2 VLP and nanoparticle vaccines have also been developed and have demonstrated their potential to induce protection against disease with low doses (14, (42) (43) (44) .\n",
            " In this study, we use the AP205 VLP and tag/catcher system to construct a baculovirus-derived SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on the S1 subunit. Covalent conjugation of antigens on the VLP surface can be achieved by the Spytag/Spycatcher platform (45, 46) . This plug-and-display technology is based on a bacterial adhesin that has been split genetically into a tag and catcher peptide, which forms a covalent bond upon mixing (47) . Even without adjuvant, AP205 VLPs decorated with antigens have been found to induce robust immune responses at a single dose (48, 49) . Recently, the RBD domain of SARS-COV-2 was coupled to these VLPs using a proprietary split-protein tag/catcher technology, resulting in robust neutralizing antibody production in mice (34) , and has been further developed into a phase I/II clinical study.\n",
            " Using the IC-BEVS, we demonstrate insect cell-mediated production and purification of (i) the full-length spike protein, (ii) a secreted form of a prefusion-stabilized spike, and (iii) a secreted form of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain. We formulated the secreted S as an adjuvanted subunit vaccine and tested protection of K18-hACE2 mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We also fused the S1 domain to the split-protein tag and displayed this on AP205 VLPs. Mice vaccinated with the S1-VLP vaccine had strong immune responses and neutralizing antibodies against both the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 and the UK/B.1.1.7 variant (VOC-202012/01) that was predominant in Europe.\n",
            " Baculovirus expression and localization of SARS-COV-2 spikes in Sf9 insect cells. To determine the most suitable recombinant baculovirus system to produce SARS-CoV-2 spike variants and to determine the most suitable secretion signal sequence, Sf9 cells were infected with AcBACe56 and AcOET recombinant baculoviruses encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Fig. 1a) . The spike proteins were similarly expressed in the cells with either the N-terminal HBM signal sequence or the baculovirus GP64 signal sequence (Fig. 1b , compare Sp1 with Sp2). Furthermore, the AcBACe56 and AcOET recombinant baculoviruses induced expression of S proteins that were recognized by convalescent-phase sera from COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1b) . Baculovirus encoding GFP (AcGFP) and mock-infected Sf9 cells were included as controls and were not detected by the same sera. As expected, removal of the C-terminal transmembrane (CT) domain from the spike protein lowered the detection signal, since S was now excreted from the cells (Fig. 1b , AcOET-Sp9). Compared to AcOET, our in-house AcBACe56 produced similar yields of secreted S (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Generation of recombinant AcOET baculovirus stocks demands less hands-on time than AcBACe56. Therefore, AcOET-Sp9 was used for further production and purification of secreted S.\n",
            " Immunogenicity of a SARS-COV-2 subunit vaccine from insect cells. The prefusion-stabilized S was produced with AcOET-Sp9 baculoviruses in ExpiSf9 cells cultured in shake flasks in chemically defined medium. After purification, the recombinant protein yield was estimated to be 180 mg S protein per liter of culture fluid with relatively low purity (Fig. 2a) . The insect cell proteins in the culture fluid contaminated the S protein and could not be removed with a single purification step. We subsequently used this S with AS01 adjuvant in a vaccination challenge study in four K18-hACE2 transgenic mice (Fig. 2b) . After two intramuscular immunizations with 5 mg adjuvanted S, we measured virus-neutralizing activity in sera of the vaccinated mice. Two mice (M3 and M4) had detectable neutralizing antibody responses, both with a reciprocal serum dilution titer of 15. There were no measurable amounts of neutralizing antibodies in the other two animals (M1 and M2) or in the sera obtained after the first immunization. Mice were challenged with an intranasal sublethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 at 18 weeks postprime. Two mice, M1 and M2, developed disease symptoms and showed a loss of body weight, in contrast to the exposed-immune control group (Fig. 2c) . At 5 days postchallenge, SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in their lungs, nasal turbinate, and brains (Fig. 2d) . This demonstrates SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in the vaccinated K18-hACE2 mice (50, 51) , similar to the nonvaccinated controls (Fig. 2d ). M3 and M4 were protected from clinical COVID-19 disease and weight loss similar to the exposedimmune control group (Fig. 2c) . Although no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the lungs, virus was measured in the nasal turbinate of M3 and in the brains of both M3 and M4 (Fig. 2d) . As a result, two intramuscular doses of adjuvanted S could provide partial protection against SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 mice.\n",
            " Production of strep-tagged S1 subunit increases yield and purity. We next aimed to produce the S1 subdomain to improve protein yield and purity after purification. Moreover, the adjuvanted spike subunit vaccine did not completely inhibit viral infection in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. To improve the immunogenicity of the S1 antigen, the nanoparticle-based AP205 VLP display system was used. The secreted S1 (Fig. 1a , Sp53) was produced with AcOET-Sp53 baculoviruses in ExpiSf9 cells in shake flasks. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses showed that S1 was successfully expressed and secreted into the culture fluid (Fig. 3a) and could be purified efficiently using strep-tag affinity chromatography (Fig. 3b) . The strep-tag affinity column had a higher specificity than the His-tag nickel affinity column and resulted in a relatively pure S1 protein compared to the purity of S after immobilized-metal affinity chromatography. The C- (a) In this study, recombinant baculoviruses were constructed containing spike proteins as schematically represented. (b) S full-length and S (delta TM) were detected inside Sf9 cells after staining with rabbit polyclonal sera against S1 (anti-S1) or cytoplasmic tail in S2 (anti-CT) or with human convalescent-phase sera obtained from two hospitals (EMC and Isala). pAb, polyclonal antibody.\n",
            " van Oosten et al.\n",
            " terminal strep-tag was removed by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage, resulting in TEV-cleaved S1 (60%) and an S1 aggregate (30%) (Fig. S2) . Removal of the streptag was demonstrated by a shift in protein size on SDS-PAGE and a loss of signal from StrepTactin-alkaline phosphatase (AP) antibody on Western blotting (Fig. 3c) . Both S1 and the S1 aggregate fractions show a band with the same mass on denaturing SDS-PAGE and binding on Western blotting to rabbit-anti-S1 and several human COVID-19 convalescent-phase sera (Fig. 3d) . Moreover, S1 has a high binding affinity to immobilized ACE2, with a dissociation constant (k D ) of 16.7 nM (Fig. 3e) , which is in a similar range as previously reported (10, 34, 52) . This indicates that the receptor-binding site within S1 is exposed and available to interact with ACE2.\n",
            " The secreted S1 production was further scaled up from shake flasks to a 3-liter bioreactor system infected at low multiplicity of infection (MOI). Cells were grown for 3 days before infection with baculovirus. The reactor was monitored continuously online using a holographic microscope and was sampled daily for offline measurements. The maximum viable cell density (VCD) was monitored both online and offline and peaked at 3 dpi (Fig. 3f) . At 4 dpi, all detected cells showed signs of baculovirus infection (Fig. 3g) . The bioreactor was harvested at 5 dpi when viability dropped below 70%. The culture fluid then contained 7 mg/liter S1, which further increased to 11 mg/liter during subsequent shake flask cultivation (Fig. 3g ). This is a substantial increase in protein yield compared to the 0.18 mg/liter that was obtained for the S protein.\n",
            " Analyses of S1 structure, folding, and glycosylation. The structure, folding, and glycosylation of insect cell-derived S1 were analyzed by several methods. The secondary structure content was calculated from the far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of S1 (Fig. 4a ). With 6.8% a-helices and 38.4% b-sheets, the secondary structure content of S1 was highly similar to what was expected based on the wildtype (WT) SARS-CoV-2 spike structure ( Fig. 4b and c ) (i.e., 2.3% helices, 41.2% (a) S was produced with the ExpiSf expression system and purified from medium. The elution fractions were pooled and analyzed on SDS-PAGE (stain-free) and Western blotting (anti-S1) in a serial dilution. (b) K18-hACE2 mice (n = 4, M1 to M4) were immunized with two doses of 5 mg S and AS01 adjuvant, where blood was collected after each vaccination. At 18 weeks postprime, the mice were challenged intranasally with SARS-CoV-2. (c) From 0 to 5 days postchallenge (dpc), body weight change was monitored. (d) At 5 dpc, the viremia in lungs, nasal turbinates, and brain were measured. Mice vaccinated with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 served as an exposed immune control (n = 3, C1-C3), and nonvaccinated controls (n = 12) were included in viremia titrations. sheets). Thus, CD confirms that at 20°C the purified spike S1 domain mostly retained its structural elements.\n",
            " The oligomerization state, molar mass, and glycosylation of S1 were determined by duplicate size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments. Three oligomerization states could be distinguished in the chromatograms, as monitored by absorbance of UV light at 280 nm (Abs280), refractive index (dRI), and light scattering (LS) (Fig. 4d, Fig. S3 ). Conjugate analysis revealed that peak 1 represented a glycosylated protein species with a molecular weight of 90.9 6 0.2 kDa. This glycosylated protein consisted of a protein component (82.4% 6 1.1%) with a molecular weight of 74.9 6 1.0 kDa and a glycan component (17.6% 6 1.1%) with a molecular weight of 16.0 6 0.2 kDa. The molecular weight of the protein component in peak 1 is in good agreement with the 77.1 kDa that is expected for the S1 protein monomer based on the amino acid sequence. The dn/dc value (i.e., the refractive index increment) for the conjugate (i.e., 0.1775 ml/g) was obtained and was used to calculate the molecular weights of the species in elution peaks 2 and 3. The protein species were found to be 183.4 6 0.4 kDa for peak 2 and 279.8 6 1.6 kDa for peak 3. Thus, the protein species eluting in peaks 1, 2, and 3 corresponded to an S1 monomer, dimer, and trimer, respectively. Under these conditions, the monomer is clearly the predominant S1 form. (a) Far-UV CD spectrum of S1 at 20°C and the resulting percentage of helixes, sheets, and other structures within S1. (b) Data derived from CD measurements (experimental) were compared to those from wild-type S1 (crystal structure). (c) The proposed structure of S1 in trimeric conformation, based on the truncation of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 structure (77). (d) A representative chromatogram of S1 on a Superdex 200 increase 10/30 column, as detected by differential refractive index (dRI), absorption at 280 nm (A280), and light scattering (LS). The molecular weight of the species eluting in each indicated peak is shown in orange (conjugate mass). (e) S1 N-linked glycosylation was further confirmed by PNGase-F treatment and PAS staining. TEV-cleaved S1 was treated with PNGase-F. Treated (1) and nontreated (2) samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (stain-free) and Western blot (anti-S1). Glycosylation was confirmed by PAS stain.\n",
            " Glycosylation of S1 was further confirmed by PNGase-F treatment and Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of the protein. The PNGase-F treatment, which removes Nlinked glycans, caused a shift in protein migration on SDS-PAGE gel and a loss of PAS staining of the Western blot membrane (Fig. 4e) . Together, they substantiate the results obtained with SEC-MALS. Thus, S1 produced in Sf9 cells is heavily glycosylated, akin to SARS-CoV-2 proteins that were produced in HEK293 cells (53) .\n",
            " Display of S1 on AP205 VLPs. To improve the immunogenicity of the prototype vaccine, the S1 and S1 aggregate fractions were individually mixed in equimolar ratios with catcher-VLPs in an overnight coupling reaction (Fig. 5a) . We included the S1 protein that still contained the C-terminal strep-tag (S1-strep) as a control. The coupling efficiency was assessed on a reducing SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 5b . An additional band of higher molecular mass appeared on the SDS-PAGE gel, corresponding to one S1 molecule covalently bound to one AP205 capsid. Removal of the C-terminal streptag by TEV protease cleavage improved the coupling efficiency. In that case, the coupling efficiency was estimated as at least 10%. This suggests that, on average, each VLP displayed at least 18 S1 proteins on its surface. A centrifugation step after coupling (stability spin test) revealed that the coupling was stable and the S1-VLP was not prone to aggregation. These results are similar to what was seen for a previously developed RBD-VLP vaccine (34) . After purification of the VLPs from the remaining soluble S1, the VLPs are intact and of good quality, and the S1 domains are uniformly distributed among the VLP particles, as seen by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 5c) .\n",
            " Immunogenicity of the S1-VLP nanoparticle vaccine. The immunogenicity of the S1-VLP was assessed in a mouse immunization study and was compared to mice vaccinated with soluble S1 protein. Before vaccine formulation of S1-VLP, the unbound S1 was removed from the coupling reaction mix by using ultracentrifugation. BALB/c mice (n = 4) received two intramuscular immunizations containing only 0.5 mg S1-VLP or 0.5 mg S1 per dose, formulated with Addavax, and blood was collected 2 weeks after each vaccination (Fig. 5d ). All mice showed potent immune responses, especially after the second immunization, as measured in an IgG protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 5e ). The areas under the curve (AUC) were derived from the ELISA data and showed a slight difference in IgG levels after the first immunization between the two groups, with the S1-VLP vaccine performing better (Fig. 5f ). After the second immunization, however, the effect of the VLP coupling was less clear, possibly because in both groups an adjuvant was used.\n",
            " These sera were compared to sera of mice vaccinated with 5 mg of the previously developed RBD-VLP vaccine (34) . Even though the antigen concentration in the S1-VLP vaccine trial was 10-fold lower, all groups had comparably high antibody responses to the spike protein, as determined by ELISA (Fig. 5g ). The IgG titers specific for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain were higher in the RBD-VLP vaccinated mice than our S1-and S1-VLP-vaccinated mice after the first bleed but not after the second bleed (Fig. 5h) .\n",
            " Finally, after the second vaccination, all sera contained substantial virus-neutralizing antibody titers against the Wuhan (L008) SARS-CoV-2 strain, on which the vaccine was based (Fig. 5i) . Importantly, sera were also able to neutralize the UK (B.1.1.7) strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5j) .\n",
            " The development and/or improvement of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are still a priority worldwide. Protein-based vaccines are needed to vaccinate the world population and to boost immunity against emerging variants. These vaccines are known for their inherent long-term safety and efficacy after administration and lack of preexisting antivector immunity (54) . Moreover, the production safety, production costs, and vaccine storage temperatures are advantageous compared to mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines, especially for scale-up manufacturing and global distribution (55) . In this study, we have used the versatile and scalable baculovirus expression vector system to generate a two-component nanoparticle vaccine that induced a potent neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n",
            " van Oosten et al.\n",
            " Low-dose vaccination of BALB/c mice with soluble S1 and S1-VLP induces potent neutralizing antibody responses. (a) S1 was coupled to VLPs by a coupling reaction as schematically represented. The catcher-VLPs are mixed with tag-S1, which results in a covalent display (decorated S1-VLP) that is visible on a reduced, denaturing SDS-PAGE gel. The individual components (catcher-VLP and S1) are shown. (b) Antigens were mixed with VLP and were analyzed again before (2) and after (1) a centrifugation step. An extra band appears representing the covalently fused S1 to a single AP205 capsid (S1-capsid). (c) The VLPs were purified from the uncoupled S1 subunits and visualized by negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The scale bar represents 50 nm. (d) BALB/c mice (n = 4 per group) were vaccinated with 0.5 mg soluble S1 or 0.5 mg S1-VLP with Addavax adjuvant. Blood was collected 2 weeks postprime (1st bleed) and 2 weeks postboost (2nd bleed). (e) IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike were analyzed in a dilution series in an ELISA. (f to h) The IgG titers were expressed (Continued on next page) SARS-CoV-2 Nanoparticle Vaccine from Insect Cells Both secreted S and S1 were produced with the ExpiSf9 expression system in chemically defined medium, which is both serum-free and protein-free. A yield after purification of 0.18 mg/liter for S was obtained. This is relatively low, although production yields of prefusion-stabilized S vary greatly between expression systems. Yields of 0.5 mg/liter S have been reported for FreeStyle 293 cells (10), 5 mg/liter for HEK293 cells (56) , and up to 200 mg/liter for stably transfected CHO cells (57) . Whereas trimeric S is often unstable (58, 59) , smaller spike protein domains, for example, S1 or RBD, are generally more stable and result in higher yields. RBD is produced up to 50 to 60 mg/liter in Schneider-2 insect cell lines and Expi239F cells, respectively (34, 43) , but production yields of the S1 subunit have not been reported to our knowledge. During our scale-up of S1 production in a stirred-tank bioreactor, we measured a maximum yield of 11 mg/liter culture, which might be further increased by subsequent parameter optimization that could be facilitated by online monitoring of the baculovirus infection process. The clear advantages of baculovirus expression over other expression platforms are its excellent safety profile, the rapid scalability to bioreactors up to several thousand liters, and its demonstrated use in the production of protein and VLP-based human vaccines (18, 19, 30) . Based on the dosage of SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines in current phase 3 clinical trials (5 mg/dose, Novavax, Clinical Trials registration no. NCT04583995; 10 mg/dose, Sanofi Pasteur, Clinical Trials registration no. NCT04904549) and a licensed subunit vaccine made with the BEVS (135 to 180 mg/dose; FluBlok [60] ), a million-dose vaccine batch of S1-VLP theoretically can be produced in a single insect cell bioreactor. Moreover, as demonstrated for the Flublok influenza vaccine, the production process can easily be adapted to new protein variants in only 6 weeks (30, 61) .\n",
            " Using multiple analyses, we have demonstrated correct folding, ACE2 affinity, and extensive glycosylation of the insect cell-derived S1. While glycosylation patterns in insect cells are less complex and more homogeneous than in mammalian expression systems (53, 62) , there are no indications that insect glycosylation patterns positively or negatively affect the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 or other glycoprotein-based vaccines (13, 17, 31) .\n",
            " In a first attempt to investigate the immunogenicity of insect cell-derived SARS-CoV-2 antigen, adjuvanted S was tested in a vaccination-challenge experiment in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, but only partial protection against sublethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge was obtained. The impurities in the His-tag-purified S subunit, including glycosylated insect cell proteins, lower the effective dose to induce a specific antibody response against S. This is in line with clinical studies in which low immune responses of baculovirusexpressed, adjuvanted S protein subunit in certain age groups were reported, and this may lead to a higher reactogenicity of the vaccine (35) . Thus, a better SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation was needed, and this was accomplished by coupling S1 subunits to AP205 VLPs (34) .\n",
            " The tag/catcher coupling of S1 to the VLPs was increased after removal of the strep-tag and was estimated to be at least 10%. Display of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain onto AP205 VLPs showed 33 to 45% coupling efficiency (34) , and display of other proteins ranged from 22 to 88%, which negatively correlated with the size of the antigen (45) . The coupling efficiency might be further improved by increasing the coupling pressure where the antigen is present in excess in the mixture. The coupling also is potentially facing partial steric hindrance between the relatively large, glycosylated S1 antigens, and it may be useful in future studies to experiment with flexible linkers at the S1 C terminus to provide additional space to further improve antigen coupling. Moreover, S1 is highly glycosylated, and these glycans might further impair efficient coupling by steric hindrance between S1 domains. We have displayed an average of 18 relatively large S1 proteins on each 30-nm VLP, which is spaced comparably to the spikes on the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virion (52, 63, 64) .\n",
            " The S1-VLPs (and S1 subunit for comparison) were used to immunize BALB/c mice twice with a low dose of 0.5 mg per mouse. The vaccines were adjuvanted with AddaVax, an MF59-like oil-in-water emulsion. Comparison between adjuvants in SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines has shown that these squalene-based oil-in-water emulsions are among the most potent adjuvants (16, 44, 65) . An adjuvanting effect of the VLP was observed only after the first immunization, where a significant difference between the S1 subunit and S1-VLP was observed in the amount of IgG produced. After the second immunization, the S1 subunit and S1-VLP performed similarly in inducing potent immune responses. The boosting effect of the second immunization and the addition of Addavax adjuvant in both vaccine groups might be obscuring the intrinsic adjuvanting effect of the AP205 VLP (42) .\n",
            " An RBD-VLP prototype vaccine is currently under evaluation in the COUGH-1 clinical phase I/II trial (National Library of Medicine, Clinical Trials registration no. NCT04839146) and makes use of the same AP205 VLPs but with an RBD antigen expressed in S2 Drosophila cells (34) . We show that our S1-VLP vaccine reaches IgG titers comparable to those of the RBD-VLP but with a 10-times-lower antigen dose (0.5 mg for S1-VLP versus 5 mg for RBD-VLP). In line with this result, a comparison of HEK293-cell-derived S1 and RBD subunits showed that S1 gave superior immune responses when formulated as a subunit vaccine (33) . It remains to be seen if enhanced immunogenicity of S1 compared to RBD can compensate for the less efficient S1-VLP coupling. In our study, both vaccines appear equally potent in generating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies.\n",
            " Neutralizing antibodies are an important immune correlate of protection (6, 66, 67); therefore, it was an important finding that all mice generated high neutralizing antibody titers for both the Wuhan L008 as well as the B.1.1.7 UK variant of SARS-CoV-2. The neutralizing antibody titer determinations have been performed in separate assays and, thus, cannot be directly compared, but it is feasible that protection against B.1.1.7 is somewhat reduced due to the presence of several mutations in the S1 domain (HV69-70del, Y144del, N501Y, A570D, and D614G). With RBD-based vaccines, this difference would only be a single amino acid (N501Y) (68) . Immunogenicity against current and emerging variants might be further improved by the development of a multivalent vaccine, i.e., a VLP displaying a mixture of S1 variants. This can result in a more focused immune response toward conserved protein domains and broader protection against variants, as was shown for HIV (69) . Neutralizing antibody responses against other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, like B.1.1.7, are important for future vaccine designs and for the progression of vaccine candidates through clinical trials toward licensing (70) . With novel SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging in the years to come, these two-component nanoparticle vaccines can be quickly adapted as booster vaccines by simply updating the antigen component.\n",
            " Insect cells. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells were cultured in Sf900II serum-free medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher) with 50 mg/ml gentamicin. ExpiSf9 cells were cultured in ExpiSf chemically defined medium (CDM) (Thermo Fisher). Both cell lines were cultured in suspension in shaker flasks at 27°C and 110 rpm in an orbital shaker.\n",
            " Plasmid design and construction. All constructs are based on the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan isolate (accession no. QIA20044.1) spike gene that was codon optimized for production in Drosophila melanogaster (34) . For endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocation and secretion, the native N-terminal signal sequence was replaced with either the Honeybee Melittin (HBM) or AcMNPV GP64 signal sequence. PCR was performed on either the wild-type spike sequence or the prefusion-stabilized sequence with primers found in Table S1 in the supplemental material (Q5 high-fidelity 2Â master mix; New England BioLabs). All PCR products were flanked by Gateway AttB sites. The PCR products were gel purified with the Illustra GFX gel band purification kit (GE-Healthcare) and were then gateway cloned into the pDONR207 (Thermo Fisher), pDest8 (Thermo Fisher), and/or the pOET1 Gateway vectors (Oxford Expression Technologies) according to the protocol of Gateway cloning (Invitrogen). Multiple constructs were designed based on the full-length spike (S full length), the prefusion stabilized secreted spike (S), and the S1 domain (Fig. 1a) . First, the S full-length spike constructs contain the wild-type spike coding sequence (residues 16 to 1237) with an N-terminal HBM signal sequence (Sp1) or GP64 signal sequence (Sp2). Second, the S spike construct encodes an N-terminal HBM signal sequence, the prefusion stabilized ectodomain (residues 16 to 1208), a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization signal (T4 foldon), and an 8Â histidine tag (His) (Sp9). Third, the S1 domain (residues 16 to 679) was PCR amplified and cloned into the pDONR207 vector. At the C terminus of the S1 gene in pDONR207, a synthetic DNA fragment (IDT DNA) was inserted by SapI restriction cloning (New England BioLabs). The resulting construct (Sp53) encodes the S1 domain with a C-terminal GSGSGS linker, the proprietary split-protein tag, tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (ENLYFQS), and triple strep-tag (WSHPQFEKGGGSGGGSGGSAWSHPQFEKGGGSGGGSGGSAWSHPQFEK).\n",
            " Recombinant baculoviruses. Recombinant baculoviruses of Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) were generated in two ways. First, pDest8 plasmids were transposed into E. coli cells containing bacmid AcBACe56 (Dcc) (71) with the bac-to-bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher), followed by transfection of the bacmid into insect cells with Expres2TR transfection reagent (Expres2ion Biotechnologies). Second, pOET1 plasmids were transfected into insect cells with the baculovirus genome AcOET (Dcc Dp10 Dp74 Dp26) with the flashBAC Ultra kit (Oxford Expression Technologies). Baculovirus stocks were amplified in ExpiSf9 cells, and viral titers were determined by endpoint dilution assay on Sf9-easy titer cells (72) . Viral titers are defined as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) units per ml.\n",
            " IAPMA. Production of S full-length in insect cells was assessed by immunoalkaline phosphatase monolayer assay (IAPMA). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 TCID 50 per cell. At 3 days postinfection, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in acetone-ethanol (1:1) fixative, followed by another wash step. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with one of the following primary antibodies: rabbit-anti-S1 (40591-T62; Sino Biological; binds the SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain), rabbit-anti-S2 (ab272504; Abcam; binds the cytoplasmic tail [CT] of S2), or human convalescent-phase sera (Isala Ziekenhuis, Zwolle; Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam; obtained from COVID-19 patients). All primary antisera were diluted in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (Merck) and 5% skim milk powder (Campina, The Netherlands). Wells were washed once with PBS and incubated with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit or goat-anti-human secondary antibodies (Sigma). Proteins were detected by nitrotetrazolium blue-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (NBT-BCIP) staining (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Basel, Switzerland), and cells were visualized by using a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1m inverted microscope.\n",
            " Protein production in shake flasks. Recombinant proteins were produced with the ExpiSf expression system (Thermo Scientific). ExpiSf9 cells were grown in 1-liter shake flasks with 250 ml cell culture volume and were diluted to a density of 5 Â 10 6 cells/ml in medium supplemented with ExpiSf enhancer. At 18 to 24 h after dilution, the cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus at an MOI of 4 to 5 TCID 50 units per cell. The flasks were incubated for 2 to 4 days until the viability was reduced to 70%. Next, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) protease inhibitor (Roche) was added at a final concentration of 170 mg/ml. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and the pH of the resulting supernatant was increased to pH 7.8 by adding 0.1 M NaOH. The clarified supernatant was immediately used for purification or was stored at 280°C after the addition of glycerol (final concentration, 20%).\n",
            " Protein production in insect-cell bioreactor. A 3-liter bioreactor (Applikon Biotechnology) with a 2-liter working volume was inoculated with 0.5 Â 10 6 ExpiSf9 cells/ml at 99% viability. Cells were grown in CDM at 27°C with an agitation speed of 266 rpm. The dissolved oxygen (DO) was controlled at 30% air saturation by adding pure oxygen through a macroporous L-sparger. In addition, a constant headspace flow of 0.01-vvm air was applied. Cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01 at 3 days postinoculation at a VCD between 2.0 Â 10 6 and 4.0 Â 10 6 cells/ml. The reactor was harvested at 5 days postinfection (dpi) at a cell viability around 70% as described above. The reactor was monitored online continuously and was sampled daily for offline measurements. Sixty milliliters of cell culture was transferred to a shake flask during harvesting and was sampled for another 6 days. The VCD, viability, and fraction of infected cells were measured online by differential digital holographic microscopy (DDHM) with the iLine F holographic microscope (OVIZIO). The bioreactor samples were analyzed offline for VCD and viability by trypan blue exclusion by using a TC20 automatic cell counter (Bio-Rad). The SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 concentration in the medium was determined by protein ELISA (CBK4154; AssayGenie).\n",
            " Protein purification. His-tagged S spike protein was purified from the clarified medium by using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). The expression medium was clarified by centrifugation (12,000 Â g, 4°C). The clarified medium was loaded onto a Ni Sepharose excel (Cytiva) column that was equilibrated in equilibration buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, 400 mM NaCl, pH 7.8). Non-and weakly bound contaminants were removed by washing with equilibration buffer. The bound proteins were eluted from the column by a 0 to 360 mM imidazole gradient in equilibration buffer. Eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated by using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (30 kDa; Merck). The concentrate was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with a Superdex S200 (Cytiva) column equilibrated with PBS buffer at pH 7.4. Eluted fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing the S protein were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen, and stored at 220°C.\n",
            " Strep-tagged S1 spike protein was purified on a Strep-TactinXT superflow 5-ml cartridge (IBA GmbH). The clarified medium was treated with 15 ml/ml BioLock biotin blocking solution (IBA) to remove free biotin. It was then loaded onto the Strep-Tactin column equilibrated in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 (buffer W). The column was washed with buffer W, and proteins were eluted from the column in buffer W containing 50 mM biotin. To remove the triple strep-tag, we pooled van Oosten et al. ® the eluted fractions and incubated them overnight at 4°C with TEV protease at a 10:1 (wt/wt) ratio in 50 mM Tris-Cl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 8.0. The protein was concentrated and further purified by using SEC as described above. Eluted fractions were analyzed with SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing S1 were pooled, flash-frozen, and stored at 220°C. Removal of the strep-tag by TEV cleavage was confirmed on Western blot immunodetection by Strep-Tactin AP-conjugated antibody (IBA Lifesciences).\n",
            " SDS-PAGE and Western blot immunodetection. Protein samples were incubated in Laemmli buffer containing 5% b-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 95°C and were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) or a 4 to 20% or 4 to 15% stain-free SDS-PAGE gel (containing photoactivatable trihalo compound; Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized by 2.5-min UV-activated stain-free imaging (Bio-Rad GelDoc). The proteins in the gel then were blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) or nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Scientific, Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) supplemented with 3% skim milk powder (Campina, The Netherlands), and recombinant spike proteins were detected by immunodetection. As primary antibodies, we used rabbit-anti-S1 polyclonal serum diluted 1:3,000-1:5,000 (40591-T62; Sino Biological) or human COVID-19 convalescent-phase sera diluted 1:500 (Isala Ziekenhuis, Zwolle) or 1:1,000 (Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam).\n",
            " Detection was performed with either AP-conjugated secondary antibody or horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:2,500 in PBST. The AP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit (Aligent) and AP-conjugated goat-anti-human (Sigma-Aldrich) were detected by conversion of NBT-BCIP staining (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Basel, Switzerland). HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit (Sanbio) was visualized by Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) by using a Chemidoc MP (Bio-Rad). The strep-tag was detected by immunodetection with Strep-Tactin AP according to the manufacturer's protocol (2-1503-001; IBA Lifesciences).\n",
            " PNGase treatment and PAS stain. The glycosylation status of recombinant spike proteins was analyzed by a PNGase treatment and PAS staining. Protein samples were incubated with PNGase-F (P0704; New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37°C under denaturing conditions as described by the manufacturer. PNGase-F-treated and nontreated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Next, protein glycosylation was confirmed by PAS staining of the Western blot membrane. The PVDF membrane was soaked in PAS solution (1% periodic acid in 3% acetic acid) for 15 min. The membrane was washed twice with water and incubated for 15 min with Schiff's reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). The membrane was washed once in 0.5%, wt/vol, sodium bisulfite for 5 min and rinsed with demineralized water before imaging.\n",
            " Far-UV CD spectroscopy. The structural features of the insect cell-produced S1 were assessed by far-UV circular dichroism (CD). Purified S1 was diluted to 1.3 mM in PBS. The far-UV CD was measured by using a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter at 20°C with 1-mm quartz cuvettes. Spectra were obtained by averaging 30 scans and were background corrected by subtracting the far-UV CD spectrum of 30 scans of PBS acquired under identical conditions. We used the CD data as the input for the BeStSel webserver (73, 74) to acquire the secondary structure content of S1. This was compared to the structural data of the S1 domain (derived from the wild-type spike protein structure) we obtained by the program STRIDE (75) . In both algorithms, it was assumed that glycosylation and other protein modifications do not influence the amount of estimated secondary structures.\n",
            " SEC-MALS. The molar mass, oligomerization state, and degree of glycosylation of S1 were determined by SEC-MALS. The S1 protein from the scaled-up production run was purified by Strep-Tactin purification followed by removal of the strep-tag by TEV protease incubation and SEC. After SEC, the second peak on the chromatogram (Fig. S2 , elution 99 to 117 ml) was selected for SEC-MALS analyses to exclude large aggregates. An Infinity 1260 II high-performance liquid chromatography system (Agilent) was coupled to an Optilab dRI detector and miniDawn MALS detector (Wyatt Technologies, USA). The column thermostat and autosampler were both set to 20°C. The protein was diluted to 0.83 mg/ml in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and was then resolved in duplicate experiments on a Superdex 200 increase 10/30 GL column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in PBS. With ASTRA software (Wyatt Technologies), the absorption at 280 nm, light scattering, and refractive index properties of the eluates were collected and analyzed. The contribution of protein and glycosylation to the eluting species was determined by the conjugate analysis method in ASTRA using dn/dc values of 0.185 ml/g and 0.14 ml/g for protein and glycans, respectively, and an extinction coefficient for the protein at 280 nm of 1.2 ml/(mgÁcm). The dn/dc value obtained for the conjugate was used for further molecular weight determination.\n",
            " Ace2 binding kinetics. Interactions of S1 antigens with hAce2 protein were performed with a QCM Attana A200 Biosensor (Attana AB) as described elsewhere (34) . Briefly, ExpreS 2 -expressed hACE2 at 50 mg/ml (Expres2ion Biotechnologies) was immobilized on an LNB carboxyl chip. The binding of S1 proteins to the chip was measured in a 2-fold serial dilution series (200 nM to 6.25 nM) in PBS, pH 7.4.\n",
            " Vaccinations at Queensland Institute of Medical Research Berghofer. Cytokeratin-18 promoter (K18)-hACE2 mice were housed at Queensland Institute of Medical Research Berghofer. K18 mice (n = 4) received two intramuscular administrations of 50 ml vaccine, containing 25 ml purified S and 25 ml AS01 adjuvant. Blood was collected and tested for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a virus neutralization assay. The sera were diluted 1:10, and then 2-fold serial dilutions were incubated with 100 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV-2 (strain hCoV-19/Australia/QLD02/2020) for 2 h. Samples were added to Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates, and viral cytopathic effect (CPE) was quantified on day 4 by crystal violet staining. Mice vaccinated with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 provided positive-control sera, and naive mice provided negative-control sera. At 18 weeks postprime, the mice were challenged intranasally with 5 Â 10 4 TCID 50 SARS-CoV-2 per mouse (hCoV-19/Australia/QLD02/2020). Weight change was monitored for 5 days, and viral titers were determined in the lungs, brain, and nasal turbinate. Coupling S1 antigen to virus-like particles. Catcher-VLPs based on the AP205 coat protein (gene ID 956335) fused to the proprietary catcher sequence were produced in E. coli (45) . The purified S1 was coupled to the catcher-VLPs and formulated as an adjuvanted vaccine as previously described (34) . In short, S1 and catcher-VLPs were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio in PBS overnight at room temperature. A part of the mix was spun down at 16,000 Â g for 2 min to assess the stability of the coupled protein. Equal amounts of pre-and postspin samples were mixed with DTT and were heated prior to analyses by SDS-PAGE. The coupling efficiency was calculated as the percentage of AP205 capsids that had been conjugated to an S1 domain via tag-catcher interactions (76) . The protein bands on the SDS-PAGE gel were analyzed by ImagequantTL software to determine the band intensity. The band intensity of the VLP subunit before the coupling reaction was divided by the equivalent protein band after coupling and was multiplied by 100. After the coupling reaction, the S1-VLP was purified from the remaining coupling mixture. This was loaded onto an OptiPrep step gradient (23%, 29%, and 35%) (Sigma-Aldrich) and was centrifuged at 47,800 rpm for 3.30 h. Buffer exchange was then performed by dialysis in PBS.\n",
            " TEM of the S1-VLP vaccine. The quality of the VLPs after coupling, purification, and buffer exchange was assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For this, 1 ml VLP mixture was added to a carbon-coated copper grid and was incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The grid was washed once with Milli-Q water and was negatively stained for 30 s in 2% uranyl acetate and air-dried before observation with a JEOL 1400 plus transmission electron microscope.\n",
            " Vaccinations at University of Copenhagen. Experiments were authorized by the Danish National Animal Experiments Inspectorate (license no. 2018-15-0201-01541; Dyreforsøgstilsynet) and performed according to national guidelines. Female BALB/c AnNRj mice were vaccinated with 0.5 mg S1 (n = 4) or 0.5 mg S1-VLP (n = 4) formulated in Addavax (Invivogen). Blood was collected 2 weeks after each immunization. The serum was isolated by two centrifugation steps at 800 Â g for 8 min at 8°C. Specific IgG titers in serum samples were measured by ELISA. For this, the plates were coated with 0.1 mg/well recombinant ExpreS 2 -produced spike protein or RBD (Expres2ion Biotechnologies). Serum samples were added at a starting dilution of 1:50 and added in 3-fold dilutions. IgG titers were determined by optical density measurements after incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (A16072; Life Technologies). Plates were developed by using TMB X-tra substrate (4800A; Kem-En-Tec) and absorbance measurements at 450 nM. Virus-neutralizing antibody titers in the mouse sera were determined on Vero E6 cells as described elsewhere (34) with SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan (L008) or SARS-CoV-2 UK/B.1.1.7 (VOC-202012/01) at 120 TCID 50 /well.

            "Body Text:\n",
            " The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan, China in 2019 causes severe pneumonia with 4 574 089 deaths as of September 8, 2021 (https://covid19.who.int/) and enormous socio-economic consequences 1 . SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus belonging to the beta-coronavirus genus from the coronaviridae family. On its membrane surface, it exposes the membrane heterotrimeric glycoprotein protein S, known as the Spike. The ectodomain of the S protein is divided into S1 and S2 domains. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike proteins bind to a host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as an entry receptor. A subdomain of the S1 domain, named receptor binding domain (RBD) 2,3 , is the contact interface between the virus and the ACE2 receptors. Several neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) 4 \n",

            " interaction.\n",
            " The cryo-EM structure of the receptor/spike complex enabled to define precisely the key residues involved in the contacts and showed that their mutations altered binding affinity 2,3,6,7 .\n",
            " Due to its surface-exposed location and critical role in entry, the S protein is a main target of NAbs upon infection and therefore a good candidate for vaccine design. Thus, most vaccines currently licensed for humans use this protein as an antigen. Vaccine platforms are essentially based on the use of recombinant adenoviral vectors or mRNA. Adenovirus is an attractive nonreplicative vector because of its ease of production and storage and was used in several of the currently authorized COVID vaccines 8 . However, pre-existing immunity in the human population is a potential concern to the effectiveness of such delivery vehicles resulting in the use of a non-human derived adenoviral vector or alternating use of several human serotypes such as HAdV-5 and HAdV-26 8 .\n",
            " Beside the whole S protein, numerous studies have shown that the RBD comprises multiple distinct antigenic sites and is a prime target for neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent patients [9] [10] [11] [12] . Moreover, these NAbs have been shown to confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in animal models of COVID-19, as well as to prevent COVID-19 in human, thus confirming the interest of using RBD as a vaccine immunogen 13, 14, 15 .\n",
            " We have previously reported that a non-infectious particle derived from human Adenovirus of type 3 consisting of 60 identical penton base monomers could be modified to display epitopes of interest including those from emerging viruses as its surface [16] [17] [18] . In this vaccine platform named ADDomer, exposed loops of the penton base protein were engineered to allow insertion of foreign peptides such as a linear neutralizing epitope from Chikungunya virus. However, insertion of structurally complex antigens was not permitted by this first platform. To overcome this limitation while keeping the immunological advantages of ADDomer, we describe here a novel adenovirus-inspired vaccine platform offering a unique highly versatile display of large and structurally complex antigens with post-translational modifications. To allow the versatile insertion of large antigens, the Spy Tag/Spy Catcher system [19] [20] [21] [22] was combined to the ADDomer technology. In this system derived from Streptococcus pyogenes an Aspartate residue from the 13 amino-acid SpyTag peptide (ST) can spontaneously create a covalent bond with a Lysine residue encompassed in the complementary SpyCatcher module (SC). We genetically inserted the sequence coding the ST peptide into the 'variable loop' of the ADDomer that was previously used for small antigen insertion. On the other hand, the RBD antigen from SARS-CoV-2 virus was fused to SC, in order to make a novel and original ADDomer-based COVID-19 vaccine. Here, we report that the newly designed platform can successfully be decorated with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and is highly immunogenic in mice, eliciting high neutralizing Ab titers.\n",
            " ADDomer is a non-infectious 30 nm nanoparticle, formed from 12 bricks of the homopentameric penton base from the human adenovirus type 3. The ST sequence was inserted in the ADDomer gene in a region coding for the exposed flexible loop called the variable loop ( Figure 1a ). Due to the spontaneous homo-oligomerization of twelve pentameric penton base, sixty copies of ST are exposed on the surface of the ADDomer-ST (ADD-ST) particle. To assess whether the newly inserted ST sequence was accessible and functional on ADD-ST, incubation with different ratio of SC was performed. SDS-PAGE profile clearly showed that the incremental SC/ADD-ST ratio is correlated with the apparition of a band of higher molecular weight and the decrease of the intensity of bands related to unlinked moieties.\n",
            " Importantly, there was no remaining signal for undecorated ADD-ST after SC addition at the highest ratio thus reflecting the full decoration of the nanoparticle (Figure 1b) . This result suggests an efficient and concentration-dependent formation of the ADD-ST/SC complex.\n",
            " Mass spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the ADD-ST doublet shifted by 13,3kDa ( Figure   1c ), which corresponds to the molecular weight (MW) of SC. The two peaks observed in mass spectroscopy is due to a second initiation codon in ADD-ST (starting at Methionine 25) and SC can bind to each form indifferently as shown by a similar shift of their MW corresponding to the addition of SC. Negative staining electron microscopy imaging performed on ADD-ST alone and ADD-ST fully decorated by SC showed that the integrity of the particle was not affected by the presence of SC and the grainy appearance of ADD-ST/SC likely reflects the presence of SC at the particle surface ( Figure 1d ). Altogether, these data show that SC crosslinking to ADD-ST is operational and can result in saturated decoration of the nanoparticle.\n",
            " -\n",
            " In order to visualize the SC arrangement around the ADDomer particle, a structural study by cryo-electron microscopy was used. Fully decorated ADD-ST/SC particles were imaged on a Glacios electron microscope (Figure 2a ). Image analysis was performed and the obtained 3D structure was compared to the structure of an undecorated ADDomer particle (EMD-0198).\n",
            " An extra-density corresponding to SC bound to the ADDomer 'variable loop' was clearly visible in ADD-ST/SC both in the density slice of the 3D map ( Figure 2b ) and in the isosurface representation of the structure (Figure 2c , purple density). The resolution of the ADDomer particle is around 2.8 Å, allowing to clearly see the aminopeptidic chain. However, the ST/SC part is not rigidly attached to the ADDomer, which explain why the corresponding density is fuzzy, and the structure not better defined. The ADDomers have 2, 3 and 5 axis of symmetry, (the latter two being shown in Figure 2c ), which is a characteristic of a dodecahedron meaning that SC are distributed accordingly. Interestingly, along the 3-fold axis SC are ~ 4.7 nm apart which is close to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (~ 4.1 nm), suggesting that the decorated particles would closely mimic the natural trimeric arrangement of RBDs (Figure 2d ). Both the multivalency of SC displayed by the particle and the arrangements they have around the different symmetry axis could be an asset for vaccination purpose if an antigen is fused to this module.\n",
            " -Secreted RBD fused to SC is glycosylated and can be displayed at different ratios on the ADD-ST particle\n",
            " To take advantage of the spontaneous and covalent linking of SC to ADD-ST, we reasoned that SC could be used as a versatile carrier to easily and efficiently fuse epitopes, like in this SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development (Figure 3a) , and in broader perspectives to diverse soluble proteins of interest. In the present study, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was fused to the N-terminus of the SC present at the surface of the HeLa cells ( Figure 4b ). Finally, a competition experiment between a pseudo-typed virus harboring the SARS-CoV-2 spike and either RBD-SC or ADD-RBD was performed. Negative control was made with undecorated ADD-ST alone. As expected, both RBD-SC alone and ADD-RBD were able to compete with the pseudo-typed virus with a slightly higher efficiency for the RBD-decorated particle (Fig. 4c) . Altogether, these experiments showed that RBD-SC is properly folded and can bind the ACE2 receptor at the molecular and cellular scales when applied alone (RBD-SC) or linked to the ADDomer particles (ADD-RBD).\n",
            " -\n",
            " Multivalent exposition of RBD antigens at the surface of the particle is likely to result in a better activation of the humoral system than RBD alone. However, one cannot exclude that ADDomer itself could also play an indirect role in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 response, especially in a population with preexisting adenovirus immunity. To address these two points, four groups of ten mice were designed ( Figure 5a ). The two first control groups were injected with RBD-SC alone in the group 1 or with the same amount of unlinked RBD-SC plus naked-ADDomer (i.e.\n",
            " not displaying the antigen) in the group 2. The two other groups (groups 3 and 4) were vaccinated with ADD-RBD (i.e. RBD displayed at the particle surface) but the group 4 was pre-immunized with naked-ADDomer two weeks before the injection of ADD-RBD, to investigate the role of adenovirus pre-immunity ( Figure 5b ). The presence of anti-adenovirus antibodies in group 4 was checked one day before the first immunization with ADD-RBD by ELISA using anti-ADDomer antibodies. The results (Supplementary Figure 1) show that all mice of this group were preimmunized against naked-ADDomer. Then, the immune response against RBD was monitored by ELISA at day 13 (post-1 st immunization) and day 27 and 41\n",
            " (post-2 nd immunization). The RBD-decorated particles induced a significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 response after the first immunization (day 13, figure 5c), whereas no response was detectable in controls of group 1 (RBD-SC alone) or group 2 (ADDomer with not displayed SC-RBD).\n",
            " Interestingly, adenovirus pre-immunity enhanced significantly the anti-RBD response.\n",
            " -\n",
            " Two weeks after the second immunization (day 27), the anti-RBD response was clearly boosted for groups 3 and 4 that were injected with ADD-RBD, whereas the control groups 1 and 2 showed more heterogeneous responses (Figure 6a ). This observation definitely confirms that our vaccine platform displaying multivalent RBD antigens yields a rapid and efficient humoral response. The ADDomer technology applied to RBD antigen also demonstrated a long lasting immunogenic effect with anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies remaining at the highest level at day 41 ( Figure 6b) . The difference between mice pre-immunized by adenovirus (group 4) or not (group 3) was less pronounced than after the first immunization, both groups reaching high and comparable levels. Altogether, these results showed that the second immunization enabled a high and long-lasting antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD using the ADDomer platform and that adenovirus pre-immunity is beneficial in particular to the initial responses ( Figure 6c ).\n",
            " -\n",
            " Since the RBD is critical for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, antibodies elicited through immunization with the RBD (RBD-SC or ADDomer-RBD) can hinder the interaction between the Spike proteins and ACE2, blocking viral entry. The ability to neutralize the virus depends on the affinity of the antibodies for the RBD domain, as well as on the epitope recognized. To assess the potency and efficacy of the antibodies induced in the four immunized groups of mice, the neutralization potency of sera (day 41) from vaccinated mice were assessed using SARS-CoV-2 spike (Wuhan strain) pseudo-typed virus and ACE2-expressing HeLa cells.\n",
            " Only a partial and heterogeneous neutralization was obtained from groups 1 and 2 sera in which RBD-SC was not displayed on ADDomer even after two immunizations (Figure 7a , upper panels). Of note, sera from mice immunized with RBD-decorated ADDomer (groups 3 and 4)\n",
            " showed a better neutralization titer even after a single injection (Supplementary Figure 2) . After the second immunization, strong virus neutralization was observed in all mice from groups 3 and 4 (Figure7a, lower panels). Neutralization titer calculation (ND50) clearly showed that mice vaccinated with RBD-decorated ADDomer had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than mice injected with the same amount of antigen but not displayed on the platform ( Figure   7b ). Moreover, in accordance with the ELISA results (Figure 5c ), the adenovirus pre-existing immunity (group 4) slightly increased the neutralization titer compared to the naïve group (group 3), which emphasizes that this pre-existing adenovirus immunity appears beneficial for our novel vaccine platform (Figure 7b ).\n",
            " In this study, we designed a novel and highly versatile vaccine platform amenable to large antigens by adapting the SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology to ADDomer, an adenovirus-inspired virus-like particle (VLP) 18, 19 . This technology has already been described for designing VLPderived vaccine, however in these approaches SC was the moiety grafted to the VLPs while the antigens were fused to the Spy Tag 20,24 . In our novel vaccine technology, we used the opposite configuration with SpyTag insertion in an internal loop of ADDomer, which minimized the risk of steric hindrance and functional impact on the spontaneous oligomerization of ADDomers.\n",
            " Insertion of ST in a surface-exposed loop of ADDomer did not impair the spontaneous assembly of twelve pentameric bricks (Figure 1d ), thus creating a universal generic platform for multivalent antigen display. Experiments of saturating cross-linking with SC alone suggested that a full decoration (i.e. 60 copies) of the particle can be achieved (Figure 1b) . The COVID pandemic led us to first evaluate our newly designed platform as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, using the RBD as the antigen to be displayed through fusion to the SC Nterminus. It is worth noting that in the 3-fold axis of ADDomer, the SC adopts a pseudo-trimeric arrangement, which on the RBD decorated VLP closely mimics the tridimensional configuration of this domain in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (Figure 2d ). The distance between SC in such configuration is 4,7 nm, which is in the same range as that between RBDs in the trimeric Spike protein (4,1 nm). Expressing soluble RBD fused to SC in insect cells resulted in N-glycosylation as expected 28 and did not affect the structure of SC, which retained its ability to cross-link to the ADD-ST vaccine platform in a dose dependent manner ( Figure   3c ). The proper folding of the glycosylated RBD exposed at the surface of the particles and its ability to bind ACE2 were assessed in a functional viral entry assay via competition with SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudo-typed virions (Figure 4c) . A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiment confirmed the high affinity interaction of ADD-RBD to ACE2, the highly stable interaction observed suggesting an avidity effect of the multivalent particle exposing multiple copies of RBD (Figure 4a ).\n",
            " The ability of the RBD-decorated ADDomer to elicit an anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response was then studied in mice. As expected, we confirmed that displaying the RBD in a multimerized manner led to a strong improvement in immunogenicity (groups 3 and 4 versus groups 1 and 2). Indeed, this was clearly apparent from the first injection where the groups with decorated particles showed a significant anti-RBD response at Day 13 as measured in ELISA (Figure 5c ), whereas no response was observed for the other groups. After the second immunization, although a response was observed in the non-decorated groups, the titers attained in the decorated groups were about 10 fold greater ( Figure 6a) . Notably, the anti-RBD response in the latter groups endured over time with similar titers at 2 and 4 weeks following the second immunization ( Figure 6b ). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD sera were further assessed for their capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in pseudo-typed virus-based assay ( Figure 7) . As seen for binding responses, a neutralizing activity was observed in the RBD-decorated groups after the first immunization. Overall, a good correlation between ELISA and neutralizing titers was observed. Strong neutralizing titers were attained in all mice immunized with ADD-RBD after the boost immunization, showing the ability of our vaccine platform to elicit functional antibody responses with a potential protective activity. The low titers obtained in mice immunized with RBD and naked ADDomer (no decoration) again demonstrated that the high immunogenicity achieved with the decorated VLPs originated from the antigen multimeric display. The data are in adequacy with results obtained with similar vaccine platforms using multimeric display of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD on scaffolds such as the 24mer-ferritin, the 60mer dodecahedral thermophilic aldolase 24, 29, 30 . In contrast to these latter vaccine platforms, our particles originate from a human virus, Adenovirus serotype 3 (HAd3), which is known to have a relatively high seroprevalence 31, 32 . A potentially detrimental impact of preexisting immunity on the immunogenicity of adenovirus-based viral vectors has been described 33 , which thus led us to explore whether such effect may also be encountered with our adenovirus-derived VLP platform. Interestingly, in contrast to adenovirus-viral vectors, our adenovirus-inspired VLP platform appears to benefit from pre-immunity. Indeed, mice with immunity to ADDomer at the time of the first immunization were found to respond with greater antibody titers against RBD than naive mice (group 4 versus group 3, Figure 5c ). This beneficial effect may be in particular explained by the formation of immune complexes leading to a better antigen presentation increasing immunogenicity 34 . This property persisted after the second immunization although the differences between groups 3 and 4 were less marked, probably due to an anti-ADDomer response generated in group 3 during the first injection.\n",
            " In conclusion, we designed a new adenovirus-inspired vaccine platform to achieve high immunogenicity against the displayed antigen. This platform efficacy is not dependent on the immunological status against adenovirus which allows to consider its use in a large coverage.\n",
            " We exemplified in the present work the ability of this technology to generate SARS-CoV-2 potent neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan strain, but its ease of use allows to envision a rapid application to different variants of concern (VOCs). Moreover, the versatility of the vaccine platform paved the way to generate mosaic particles displaying RBDs from different betacoronaviruses 35 or from different SARS-CoV-2 variants at once. More generally, this novel platform constitutes a precious tool in the preparedness to the probable emerging pathogens.\n",
            " The baculovirus expression system was used for both the production of ADDomer-SpyTag (ADD-ST) and for the RBD fused to SpyCatcher (RBD-SC). Synthetic DNA (Genscript) was cloned in the pACEBac1 using the restriction sites BamHI and HindIII. For RBD-SC, the SARS-CoV-2 spike sequence (320-554) was cloned upstream of the Spy Catcher and a hexa\n",
            " His-Tag was added in C-terminus of SC. This fusion protein was secreted using the melittin signal peptide present in the vector. Recombinant baculoviruses were made by transposition with an in house bacmid expressing Yellow Fluorescent Protein, as previously described 18 .\n",
            " Baculovirus were amplified on Sf21 cells at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) and after two amplification cycles were used to infect insect cells for 64-72h at high MOI. For ADD-ST production, the infected cells were pelleted and recovered whereas for RBD-SC cells were discarded and the supernatant was saved.\n",
            " The ADDomer and ADD-ST was purified according to classical protocol 36 Pre-immunized group received 2 weeks before the first dose of vaccine (day -15) the ADDomer vector alone (5µg in 100 µl final volume, in the right flank). The day before each vaccination, and 2 and 4 weeks after the last vaccination, 100µl of blood was withdrawn for serologic tests.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t \"A syndemic is defined as an occurrence when two or more epidemics interact synergistically to produce an increased burden of disease in a population\" -a term proposed by Merrill Singer in the mid-1990s. The COVID-19 pandemic has become an extreme form of syndemic, a pan-syndemic, where pockets of inequities (not limited to health) have been brought to light by increased disease burden and mortality compressed in a short time period throughout the world. 1 This pan-syndemic is not limited to just the US, indeed higher mortality has been documented in under-served populations throughout the world in both developed and developing countries. [2] [3] [4] Few studies have systematically used geographical information system (GIS) data to interrogate the underlying patterns of COVID-19 incidence, spread and disease outcomes. 5 The study \"Beyond the 405 and the 5: geographic variations and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in LA County\" by Vijayan et al in this issue analyzes one important facet in the continuum of the pandemic response -COVID-19 testing. Their study reveals the pervasiveness of inadequate access to testing even in communities such as the LA County. The authors of this study use GIS to integrate information from the LA department of health and US census in order to identify socio-structural determinants that have an effect on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. The authors rightly point out that the interplay between disease and socio-structural processes result in geographically distinct clusters and using GIS to analyze such data gives us important insights into the underlying driving forces of the pandemic. More importantly, such information also gives us actionable data to assist the public health initiative and devise effective socio-structural processes for an effective pandemic response.\n",
            " Vijayan et al show that low rates of test positivity and high testing were geographically clustered in affluent areas while the converse was found in neighborhoods with high population density and A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t poverty. Interestingly, their Spatial analysis also identified that one ethnicity, namely Hispanic, by itself was a \"risk factor\" for higher rates of test positivity.\n",
            " Data suggests that Hispanics work in essential jobs with lower pay and lack economic safety net that may result in increased exposure compared to other cohorts. 6 A significant proportion of Latino/a population is undocumented which makes them more vulnerable to economic insecurity especially during lockdowns due to being ineligible for federal assistance. Moreover, living in overcrowded areas with multigenerational housing potentially increases the frequency of contact and spread within the community. Language and cultural barriers also compound the difficulty to care due to access issues. 7, 8 It is well known that people living in disadvantaged neighborhoods and minority ethnic groups have unequal exposure to social determinants of health including housing, education, work and job security and access to health-care all of which compound to cause a higher chronic disease burden of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. 1,9 That COVID-19 has higher morbidity and mortality with higher chronic disease burden including untreated hypertension and diabetes is also well documented. This unfortunate recurrent theme of higher disease morbidity in the more disadvantaged populations is recapitulated both historically and contemporaneously from 1918 pandemic to the current COVID-19 pandemic. 1,10\n",
            " Having worked in underserved communities for the better part of the past decade, I have observed first-hand the high burden of chronic diseases stemming from a multitude of factors, which culminate in inequities, best described as structural violence. 11 Farmer et al. defines the term \"structural violence is one way of describing social arrangements that put individuals and populations in harm's way. The arrangements are structural because they are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world; they are violent because they cause injury to A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t people\". 11 Structural violence, a jarring term, immediately brings to realization the effect this has on the affected communities and populations. By really understanding the structural determinants that impact health equity we can envision structural interventions that are designed to systematically address those health inequities. The success of the Baltimore AIDS study in the 1990s is testament to that fact. Chaisson et al show that when given consistent medical care to HIV patients there was no difference in survival or disease progression between different groups based on race, income or sex. 12 Unfortunately, neither our medical curriculum nor the clinical training has historically focused on the importance of social forces that alter disease outcomes. It is well known that most disease modifying interventions fail if the social context is not taken into account. 13 Some physicians are likely to dismiss this as a political issue, which although true, we as physicians have a responsibility to our patients to understand their social, economic and cultural circumstances and utilize the tools available in our existing health systems to improve access to care. The political problem of structural violence requires a systematic political commitment to erase such inequities which unfortunately is a long time coming. In addition to other well-known factors, an additional factor stems from the current administration's anti-immigration rhetoric which impels immigrant, esp. Latino/a , people away from receiving care due to the concern for deportations of either themselves or close family. In addition, the specter of child separations in the border do not add to the confidence in \"the system\". 14 When I see Latino/a patients, I make it a practice to personally reassure patients that healthcare is separate from the government entity and care /testing will be provided irrespective of ability to pay for testing or treatment, a vision that is shared by the hospital system I work at.\n",
            " A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Physicians and health systems need to project confidence for vulnerable patients that inclusion and support is a part of their culture. Setting aside divisive rhetoric and embracing all of humanity as worthy of equitable care is the only way forward from this pandemic to a new post COVID-era.\n",
            " Systemic inequities have become invisible through decades of accepted threads of nativism, racism, sexism and elitism but the pandemic has shined a spot light by amplifying these inequities into a pan-syndemic. It is time that we take action to mitigate and in time hope to erase such inequities. A commitment to the assertion that healthcare is a basic human right irrespective of race, wealth, creed or citizenship is vital. Para-phrasing MLK Jr -\"No one is healthy unless we all are healthy\" rings true particularly in the light of the current COVID-19 pan-syndemic.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " The current wave of COVID-19 infections, which widely believed as an outbreak that initially sprout within the city of Wuhan in China, is beginning to assume alarming proportions across the globe, as cautioned by reports from the World Health Organization (WHO). Viral incidence rates that began to spike from the early December 2019 were the resultant cause of an infection that had contracted from a novel coronavirus (CoV) (form. 2019-nCoV). By the mid of April 2020, the global number of positive COVID-19 cases, as determined by the WHO, stood at 1,699,576 and has been climbing dangerously. Until the same period, the total deaths worldwide due to the disease were 102,734, the worst affected being the United States. It is worthwhile to note that the typically decorated Coronaviridae family, which pri- However, from a pharmacological viewpoint, we have enough evidence now to believe that the aerosolized droplet transmission of COVID-19 viral particles to the lungs involves several key pathological molecular mechanisms.\n",
            " It is well-observed among most viruses that, the common mechanism of their entry into a host cell is through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Looking at the bigger picture, we are convinced to think that the receptor employed by the COVID-19 virus to attack and modify the cells in the lungs could most probably be ACE2, a protein that is found on the surface of the cells in the kidney, heart tissues, artery and veins, and most significantly, on the epithelial cells (AT2) of the alveoli of the lungs. Moreover, AT2 cells are vulnerable to virus borne infections (Richardson et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Having mentioned that, the COVID-19 viral particles have the notorious tendency to proteolytically generate mutated, biologically active fragments of RAS, namely, Ang II and Ang 1-7. These biological fragments may subsequently activate the AT2 receptors, leading them to bind with ACE2. AT2 is a type of G-protein coupled receptor (Clayton proliferation at a faster rate in the later stages of apoptosis in defective cell (Figure 1 ).\n",
            " Here, we conclude that the COVID-19 virus activates the JNK and JAK-STAT mediated biochemical mechanisms in lungs, resulting in the proliferation and transmission of viral cells. Moreover, before recommending ACE2 inhibitors, it is worthwhile to be mindful and aware of the complications that arise during the blockade of the enzyme, which could lead to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Thus, we summarize that both JNK and JAK-STAT pathways could be targeted pharmacologically for the inhibition of the COVID-19 infection. Moreover, there must be effective strategies to contain the spread before a vaccine can be developed.\n",

            "Body Text:\n",
            " Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Colson et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020) . The scientific community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the field of antiviral research.\n",
            " The sulfate and phosphate salts of chloroquine have both been commercialised as antimalarial drugs. Hydroxychloroquine has also been used as an antimalarial, but in addition is now broadly used in autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Of note, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered to be safe and side-effects are generally mild and transitory. However, the margin between the therapeutic and toxic dose is narrow and chloroquine poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular disorders that can be life-threatening (Frisk-Holmberg et al., 1983) . Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use should therefore be subject to strict rules, and self-treatment is not recommended.\n",
            " The in vitro antiviral activity of chloroquine has been identified since the late 1960's (Inglot, 1969; Miller and Lenard, 1981; Shimizu et al., 1972) and the growth of many different viruses can be inhibited in cell culture by both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, including the SARS coronavirus (Keyaerts et al., 2004) . Some evidence for activity in mice has been found for a variety of viruses, including human coronavirus OC43 (Keyaerts et al., 2009) , enterovirus EV-A71 (Tan et al., 2018) , Zika virus (Li et al., 2017) and influenza A H5N1 (Yan et al., 2013) . However, chloroquine did not prevent influenza infection in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Paton et al., 2011) , and had no effect on dengue-infecteds patient in a randomized controlled trial in Vietnam (Tricou et al., 2010) . Chloroquine was also active ex vivo but not in vivo in the case of ebolavirus in mice (Dowall et al., 2015; Falzarano et al., 2015) , Nipah (Pallister et al., 2009 ) and influenza virus (Vigerust and McCullers, 2007) in ferrets.\n",
            " The case of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is of specific interest: chloroquine showed promising antiviral activity in vitro (Coombs et al., 1981; Delogu and de Lamballerie, 2011) , but was shown to enhance alphavirus replication in various animal models (Maheshwari et al., 1991; Roques et al., 2018; Seth et al., 1999) , most probably because of the immune modulation and anti-inflammatory properties of chloroquine in vivo (Connolly et al., 1988; Katz and Russell, 2011; Savarino et al., 2003) . In a nonhuman primate model of CHIKV infection, chloroquine treatment was shown to exacerbate acute fever and delay the cellular immune response, leading to an incomplete viral clearance (Roques et al., 2018) . A clinical trial conducted during the chikungunya outbreak in 2006 in Réunion Island showed that oral chloroquine treatment did not improve the course of the acute disease (De Lamballerie et al., 2008) and that chronic arthralgia on day 300 postillness was more frequent in treated patients than in the control group (Roques et al., 2018) . Altogether, the assessment of previous trials indicates that, to date, no acute virus infection has been successfully treated by chloroquine in humans.\n",
            " Chloroquine has also been tested in chronic viral diseases. Its use in the treatment of HIV-infected patients has been considered inconclusive (Chauhan and Tikoo, 2015) and the drug has not been included in the panel recommended for HIV treatment. The only modest effect of chloroquine in the therapy of human virus infection was found for chronic hepatitis C: an increase of the early virological response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (Helal et al., 2016) and, in a small sample size pilot trial in non-responder HCV patients, a transient viral load reduction (Peymani et al., 2016) were observed. This was not enough to include chloroquine in the standardised therapeutic https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104762 Received 29 February 2020; Received in revised form 2 March 2020; Accepted 2 March 2020 protocols for hepatitis C patients.\n",
            " Recently, Wang and colleagues (Wang et al., 2020) evaluated in vitro five FDA-approved drugs and two broad spectrum antivirals against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. One of their conclusions was that \"chloroquine (is) highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro\" and that its \"safety track record suggests that it should be assessed in human patients suffering from the novel coronavirus disease\". At least 16 different trials for SARS-CoV-2 already registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029939, ChiCTR2000029935, ChiCTR2000029899, ChiCTR2000029898, ChiCTR2000029868, ChiCTR2000029837, ChiCTR2000029826, ChiCTR2000029803, ChiCTR2000029762, ChiCTR2000029761, ChiCTR2000029760, ChiCTR2000029741, ChiCTR2000029740, ChiCTR2000029609, ChiCTR2000029559, ChiCTR2000029542) propose to use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 (\"Chinese Clinical Trial Register\" (ChiCTR)). In a recent publication (Gao et al., 2020) , Gao and colleagues indicate that, \"according to the news briefing\", \"results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course\".\n",
            " This would represent the first successful use of chloroquine in humans for the treatment of an acute viral disease, and is undoubtedly excellent news, since this drug is cheap and widely available. However, it should be considered carefully before drawing definitive conclusions, since no data has been provided yet to support this announcement. Results were produced in ten different hospitals and possibly from a number of different clinical protocols among those listed above, which include various designs for control groups (none, different antivirals, placebo, etc.) and various outcome primary indicators. The final interpretation is therefore technically demanding, and in the absence of published data, it is difficult to reach any firm conclusion. It will be of the utmost importance to know if the observed efficacy is associated specifically with chloroquine phosphate, or if this includes other salts (e.g., sulfate) of chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. It is also necessary to determine if the benefit of chloroquine therapy depends on the age class, the clinical presentation or the stage of the disease.\n",
            " In conclusion, the option of using chloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 should be examined with attention in light of the recent promising announcements, but also of the potential detrimental effect of the drug observed in previous attempts to treat acute viral diseases. We urge Chinese scientists to report the interim trial results currently running in China as soon as they are available. This should be preferentially done in a peer-reviewed publication with detailed information to allow the international scientific community to analyse the results, to confirm in prospective trials the efficacy of the proposed treatment and to guide future clinical practice.\n",

            " The persistent effects of global or local disasters can lead to psychological problems for the public and health care providers likewise. Research from previous pandemics such as the H1N1 influenza in 2009 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 highlighted the immense fear, panic and resultant psychological impact on the populace (5) . Following the COVID-19 outbreak, a webbased survey conducted in China highlighted an increase in symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (6) . The research identified that younger people are at increased risk, partly due to the time spent on social media. Another survey examining the UK population found that one in two people felt down, depressed or hopeless about the future potentially putting 41% of the nation's mental health at risk (7) . These mental health problems likely stem from 'hypochondriacal concerns' and other psychosocial elements related to economic, socialization and isolation issues (6) .\n",
            " Furthermore, patients and health care workers with other mental health conditions such as depression and somatoform disorders have reported worsening of symptoms along with relapses (8, 9) . Mortality has also been predicted to be higher in these individuals with concomitant COVID-19 infection (10) .\n",
            " With the stock market crashing and the ever-increasing likelihood of a recession, millions of people may lose their jobs. A lack of financial support in such circumstances will only worsen the psychological health of the public. In the USA, where health insurance is often tied to employment, this can lead to a greater level of stress and solutions can only be sought through changing state and government policy. On the other hand, in places such as the UK, where health care is freely available, times such as these can lead to resources being stretched and indeed, the use of new innovative technologies may help to reduce the burden on public health resources, through the provision of psychotherapies both by online humans and artificial intelligence algorithms (11) . It should be noted however that many of these applications are not free. All these factors create a recipe for major psychosocial disturbances in society. Now more than ever it is important that mental health matters are appropriately addressed and accounted for in this time of societal distress. Indeed, this is a great concern for primary care physicians.\n",
            " The carers are at great risk for psychological distress during pandemics. Evidence from the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks highlights the mental health burden on health professionals (12, 13) . A study conducted during the SARS outbreak in 2003 examining the psychological state of hospital staff found that being quarantined was the biggest predictor for the development of acute stress disorder. Furthermore, these staff including doctors, nurses and physician assistants who were quarantined were more likely to report detachment from others, anxiety, irritability, insomnia and subsequently suffered from deterioration in work performance and reluctance to work (14) . Indeed, similar trends are also being reported with Family Practice, 2020, 1-3 doi:10.1093/fampra/cmaa100 COVID-19 and the addressing of these issues is essential for a healthy workforce (15) (16) (17) .\n",
            " Perhaps one of the key failures in this pandemic has been data collection in real time, especially for mortality data from different sources, but the challenges of an unprecedented crisis, as well as lack of preparation of the public health system may be hindering factors.\n",
            " The immense pressure that medical staff are under whilst combatting the coronavirus is clear. A detailed plan involving online courses, group activities, assistance with accommodation and food, provision of leisurely activities to ease stress and detailed instructions on reducing the risk of contracting the disease should be implemented to reduce stress. It is important to ensure the health workers are not overworked and shift-based rotas be implemented ensuring adequate rest periods. Furthermore, in the UK, many companies aided health workers through the provision of free food, services, products, and accommodation. This was particularly helpful because it provided a site away from family and thus alleviates the stress of transmitting the virus to family members, many of whom may be vulnerable. Whilst this may be useful in the short term and provides good publicity for companies, it is not a sustainable option and thus governments should plan funding to companies to allow these schemes to be available for longer durations, and if further lockdowns are required, as necessary.\n",
            " There are three main priorities from a mental health perspective that should be incorporated into public health planning:\n",

            " Similarly, lessons can be learned to provide effective psychological management for members of the public. As a lot of normative patterns are disrupted due to the quarantine, it is important to establish a sense of normalcy. This can include simple measures such as having a regular, healthy sleeping pattern. Explaining to patients that, despite the quarantine, it is important to have regular time away from others within the same house, which can be helpful for some individuals. Others may require prompting to be more open and engage with individuals in the same household. For those living in isolation, contacting friends and families regularly is essential, and for those who do not have people whom they may contact, GPs should ensure that regular contact is maintained with vulnerable patients. GPs, however, are already stretched for time, and as such, the mass volunteering scheme that the UK has implemented can allow volunteers within the society to keep in contact with people who are at risk of being isolated. Other simple interventions such as exercise and relaxation techniques should also be encouraged to improve mental wellbeing. If gyms and public parks are closed, these activities should be encouraged at home. Hence, public health bodies must emphasize the importance of having a healthy routine at home, and staying connected to others via phone and text messaging. Institutions will also need to set up online platforms to provide psychological therapies and counselling for patients, family members and other individuals impacted by this pandemic.\n",
            " Tele-technologies employing video consultation may prove to be very beneficial in conducting remote consultations in accordance with current isolation guidelines (18) . Given the widespread use of the Internet and video call technologies, this will not be difficult be difficult to implement. In fact, video consultations are already routinely conducted through mobile health applications (19) . Online psychological therapies are well recognized, with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) widely used for numerous psychiatric conditions. Thus, patients currently receiving in person CBT should receive this therapy online. Furthermore, patients being seen for other nonmental health issues should be screened and tested for anxiety, social isolation, financial insecurity and general state of mind.\n",
            " This is an unprecedented situation and it is important to be malleable in our response. The mental health of those on the front lines rightfully need to be highlighted. However, the widespread nature of this pandemic is going to affect all corners of society. Hence, being proactive in finding active solutions to mitigate and improve mental health should be a high priority of public health bodies and physicians.\n",

            " Fußball-Europameisterschaft oder die Tour de France wurden verschoben. Andere Sportveranstaltungen wie die Handball-Weltmeisterschaft 2021 konnten nur unter strengen Hygienekonzepten ausgetragen werden, die dennoch das Auftreten von Infektionen mit SARS-CoV2 nicht komplett verhindern konnten. Während zu Beginn der Pandemie nur relativ wenige Spitzensportlerinnen und Spitzensportler sich nachweislich mit SARS-CoV2 infiziert hatten, werden nicht nur durch die Einführung der routinemäßig durchgeführten PCRund Antigen-Tests vermehrt Infektionen detektiert. Durch das routinemäßige Testen werden auch Sportlerinnen und Sportler identifiziert, die eine asymptomatische Infektion haben. Es stellt sich einerseits die Frage, wie mit symptomatischen Sportlerinnen und Sportlern zu verfahren ist und auf der anderen Seite, wie mit asymptomatischen Athletinnen und Athleten umzugehen ist.\n",
            " Neben den komplett asymptomatischen Verläufen einer Infektion mit SARS-CoV2 variiert das klinische Bild zwischen milden Verläufen und schweren, teils letalen Verläufen, die vor allem Personen mit Vorerkrankungen oder in höherem Lebensalter betreffen. Zu den typischen Symptomen einer Infektion zählen Schnupfen, Husten, Halsweh, Kopfschmerzen, gastrointestinale Beschwerden, Fieber, Schüttelfrost und Abgeschlagenheit [1] . Der Verlust des Geschmackssinns ist ein weiteres typisches Symptom einer SARS-CoV2-Infektion, das vor allem bei milden und moderaten Verläufen gehäuft auftritt [2] . Training kollabierte und verstarb [4] .\n",
            " Bereits während der ersten Monate der Pandemie zeigte sich, dass schwer an COVID-19 erkrankte Personen erhöhte kardiale Marker bzw. EKG-Veränderungen als Ausdruck einer kardialen Mitbeteiligung der Infektion aufweisen [5] . Dabei scheint das Ausmaß der Erhöhung des Troponinwertes mit der Prognose vergesellschaftet zu sein [6] . Schon im Frühjahr 2020 wurde auf Basis theoretischer Ü berlegungen publiziert, dass eine kardiale Beteiligung einer Infektion mit SARS-CoV2 im Sinne einer Myokarditis möglich sein könnte und nicht nur auf schwere Krankheitsverläufe beschränkt sein dürfte [7] . Die Beurteilung, ob eine kardiale Affektion durch SARS-CoV2 vorliegt, ist von entscheidender Bedeutung, da die aktuellen Empfehlungen der Europäischen Gesellschaft für Kardiologie bei gesicherter oder vermuteter Myokarditis eine 3bis 6-monatige Sportpause vorsehen [8] . Daher ist die Frage, ob oder mit welcher Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Myokarditis im Rahmen der Infektion mit SARS-CoV2 vorliegt, für die Frage des Wiedereinstiegs in das Training und den Wettkampf nach COVID-19 von entscheidender Bedeutung. Der Anteil einer kardialen Beteiligung im Rahmen von COVID-19 wird je nach untersuchtem Kollektiv sehr unterschiedlich beziffert. In einem Kollektiv von insgesamt 30 professionellen Fußballspielern aus Italien fanden sich bei den 18 Spielern, die einen milden oder asymptomatischen Verlauf der Infektion durchgemacht hatten, keine wegweisenden Auffälligkeiten in der kardiologischen Diagnostik (Ruhe-und Belastungs-EKG, Echokardiographie) im Vergleich zur Voruntersuchung. Langzeit-EKG-Aufzeichnungen, die auch während des Trainings erfolgten, waren ohne Nachweis höhergradiger ventrikulärer Rhythmusstö rungen geblieben. Das ebenfalls durchgeführte Thorax-CT zeigte bei allen Spielern keine pulmonalen Veränderungen. Allerdings erfolgte lediglich bei einem Spieler, der einen erhöhten Troponin-I-Wert aufwies, eine MRT-Untersuchung des Herzens. Dieses zeigte keine Abweichungen von der Norm [9] . Huang et al. zeigten wiederum in ihrer Untersuchung an ehemals hospitalisierten Patienten, die nach Entlassung aus dem Krankenhaus über kardiale Symptome klagten, dass bei über der Hälfte in der MRT-Untersuchung myokarditistypsiche Veränderungen zu detektieren waren [10] . Rajpal berichtet in einem Kollektiv von 26 Sportlern, die nicht hospitalisiert waren, dass bei 15% myokarditistypische Befunde in der MRT-Untersuchung zu detektieren waren, wobei alle eingeschlossenen Athleten unauffällige Befunde im Ruhe-EKG und in der Echokardiographie aufwiesen [11] . Bemerkenswert an der kleinen Studie von Rajpal ist, dass bei 8 Athleten ein Late Enhancement ohne Vorliegen eines € Odems vorlag, was die Autoren nicht im Zusammenhang mit der akuten Infektion werteten, sondern als Zeichen einer früher durchgemachten Myokarditis. Im Gegensatz fand sich in einer Untersuchung an 145 Collegestudierenden nur bei zwei Athleten myokarditistypische Veränderungen in der MRT-Untersuchung nach gesicherter Infektion mit unterschiedlichem Schweregrad des Verlaufs [12] . Das Ausmaß bzw. der Anteil kardialer Affektionen scheint daher vom untersuchten Kollektiv und vom Umfang der Diagnostik abzuhängen.\n",

The extent of the diagnosis, which is recommended before returning to (competitive) sport, is determined depending on the clinical course. While there were concerns at the beginning of the pandemic that cardiac involvement would occur in many cases, this risk initially seems to have been overestimated. On the other hand, there is increasing data that non-cardiac consequences of the infection can impair athletes in the practice of their sport in the long term. This article highlights the current recommendations regarding return to sports after COVID-19 for competitive and recreational athletes.\n",
            " Wann symptomatische und asymptomatisch infizierte Personen wieder in das Training oder den Wettkampfsport einsteigen können, wird kontrovers diskutiert. Einen ersten Vor-schlag für den Wiedereinstieg in Training und Wettkampf publizierte die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sportmedizin und Prävention (DGSP) als Positionspapier bereits zu Beginn der Pandemie im Frühjahr 2020 [13] . [15] . Einen Ü berblick über die Empfehlungen der drei Veröffentlichungen gibt Tabelle 1. Während die Empfehlungen der VBG als Arbeitsschutzstandards zu verstehen sind und sich somit in erster Linie auf BerufssportlerInnen beziehen, wurde kürzlich ein angepasster Entscheidungspfad für Sporttreibende publiziert, der eine Unterscheidung zwischen jugendlichen SportlerInnen und Masterathleten vornimmt [16] . Hier wird erstaunlicherweise auf eine zwingende ärztliche Untersuchung und Diagnostik zumindest bei asymptomatischen und Infizierten mit milder Symptomatik verzichtet. Selbst bei schweren Verläufen wird eine kardiovaskuläre Diagnostik bei unter 15-Jährigen nicht unbedingt gefordert. Lediglich das Auftreten neuer kardialer Symptome sollte sowohl bei Jugendlichen als auch bei Erwachsenen zu einer kardiovaskulären Evaluation führen. Um basierend auf den bisherigen Erkenntnissen einen im klinischen Alltag praktikablen Algorithmus für den Wiedereinstieg in Training und Wettkampf zur Verfügung zu stellen, zeigt Abb. 1 and 2 eine Modifizierung der bisherigen Vorschläge der DGSP unter Berücksichtigung der anderen Handlungsempfehlungen. Der vorgestellte Algorithmus kann sicherlich auch für den Freizeitsport Anwendung finden, zumal die potentiell erforderliche Diagnostik im deutschsprachigen Raum flächendeckend zur Verfügung steht. Für Ath-letInnen mit prolongierten Verläufen, deren Anteil am Gesamtkollektiv der Infizierten überschaubar ist, würde sich eine Vorstellung an einem spezialisierten (sportmedizinisch/sportkardiologischen) Zentrum empfehlen. Aus der Erfahrung heraus haben Leistungsund Profisportler, bei denen eine Minimierung des Ausfallzeit unter Umständen auch von Dritten (z. B. Verein, Management, Verband) gewünscht ist, ein enges (sportmedizinisches) Netzwerk, das die erforderliche Diagnostik zeitnah durchführen kann. Mindeststandards der medizinischen Versorgung sollten jedoch keinesfalls auf Druck der Athleten oder gar Dritter verlassen werden, um eine hinreichende Sicherheit für den Wiedereinstieg gewähren zu können. Auf der anderen Seite muss eine ,,Ü berdiagnostik'' vermieden werden. Die routinemäßige Durchführung einer kardialen MRT-Untersuchung könnte falsch positive oder nicht zwingend im Zusammenhang mit der akuten Infektion stehende Befunde ergeben, die -je nach Interpretation -dann zu einer möglicherweise nicht erforderlichen Sportkarenz mit negativen Konsequenzen für die Athletin oder den Athleten führen. \n",
            " In den letzten Monaten mehrten sich Berichte von Patienten, die nach einer durchgemachten Infektion mit SARS-CoV2 noch über anhaltende Symptome klagen. Dies betrifft nicht nur Patienten nach Hospitalisierung und somit schwerem Krankheitsverlauf [17] , sondern auch Infizierte mit nach mildem oder moderatem Verlauf der akuten Phase. Hierfür wurde der Begriff Long-CO-VID geprägt, wenn Symptome über einen Zeitraum von mehr als 28 Tagen nach der Infektion noch vorliegen [18] . Dabei scheint das Phänomen einer andauernden Symptomatik nach einer Infektion mit SARS-CoV2 nicht alleine auf Erwachsene beschränkt zu sein [19] . Gerade für Leistungssporttreibende kann eine anhaltende Fatigue nach COVID-19 zu einer deutlichen Beeinträchtigung der Trainings-und Wettkampfleistung führen. Ebenso sind Schlaf-störungen ein häufiges Symptom nach COVID-19, was die Regenerationsfähigkeit der SportlerInnen negativ beeinflussen kann. Auch andere teilweise langfristige Symptome, die primär zu keiner vitalen Gefährdung der AthletInnen führen, können immensen Einfluss auf die sportliche Performance haben. Eine Aufstellung möglicher nicht kardialer Komplikationen nach COVID-19, die für Leistungssporttreibende von Relevanz sein können, zeigt Tabelle 2.\n",

            " T oday, the world is facing one of the most devastating viral pandemics of our time where almost 62 million people have been infected with a novel corona virus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 (SARS-Cov2), and more than one million people have died from the corona virus induced disease . 1 The COVID-19 pandemic is also responsible for unprecedented loss of life, economic, social, and health consequences including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 2 cardiovascular, 3 mental health including anxiety, depression, and neurological complications like tremors, seizures, and impaired consciousness. 4 An estimated 45% of adults in the US reported that their mental health has been negatively impacted due to worry and stress over the virus. 5 Further, people with preexisting health conditions including asthma, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, immunocompromised state, neurological conditions such as dementia and others might be at increased risk from COVID-19. 6 The conditions such as imposed shelter-in-place, physical distancing, social isolation and potential financial distress from job loss might further lead to mental health problems, increased substance use, and possibly suicides. Furthermore, limited access to mental health care and addiction treatment health care providers for treating substance use disorder(s) may also in part exacerbate COVID-19 related complications, thereby necessitating the use of telemedicine to treat people with substance use disorder(s).\n",
            " Extensive efforts worldwide are underway to develop vaccines and therapeutics including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma to combat the coronavirus induced symptomatic disease (COVID-19) and associated complications. Even though long-term use of cannabis is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of panic attacks, 7 the internet is filled with suggestions for using cannabis or cannabinoids including cannabidiol (CBD) for the treatment of coronavirus infection induced inflammation and COVID-19 induced mental health conditions including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and panic attacks. The recent changes in legalization of CBD in many US states have made CBD products easily accessible to all as over the counter products. This commentary will briefly show that the use of CBD for the treatment of anxiety, depression and substance use disorder(s) are just myths and not a reality.\n",
            " Though CBD may be a promising drug to treat panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder, and depressive disorders 8 via serotonergic pathways and endocannabinoid system, extensive literature search failed to find sufficient clinical evidence to support CBD for treating any of the abovementioned mental conditions. 9 Much more clinical research from well-designed clinical trials is needed to support the use of CBD in treating anxiety and depressive disorders and bipolar disorders. 10 CBD may promote wakefulness via triggering increased dopamine levels in areas of the brain and thereby treat narcolepsy, and in a case report, 11 CBD did improve the quality and quantity of sleep of a 10-year old young patient with PTSD, likely due to its anxiety-relieving benefits. But these data from one patient are clearly insufficient to support the use of CBD for treating sleep disorders.\n",
            " Could CBD treat substance use disorders? The answer is not yet. Limited research suggests that CBD could potentially treat patients with substance use disorders like opioid-, cannabis-, and tobacco use disorders (OUD, CUD, TUD). 12 Earlier studies showed that legalization of medical marijuana reduced the number of over dose deaths from opioid pain relievers, 13 and that medical marijuana laws significantly reduced prescribing of opioids for pain. 14 More recently, Hurd et al 15 reported that acute administration of CBD to heroin abstinent patients with OUD significantly reduced craving, anxiety, heart rate and salivary cortisol without causing adverse effects. But still additional clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of CBD in treating opioid use disorder. 16 In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, 17 nabiximols (THCþCBD [Sativex]) combined with Motivational Enhancement Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT), reduced cannabis use and craving but not withdrawal symptoms in persons that used cannabis chronically. CBD also reduced euphoria and depressive and psychotic-like symptoms, improved attention, verbal learning and memory without impairing cognition when smoking cannabis, suggesting that prolonged therapy with CBD may be a useful adjunct therapy for treating cannabis dependence. 18 In a study of 24 tobacco smokers, CBD inhaler reduced the number of tobacco cigarettes by 40% when compared to placebo 19 ; and a single dose of 800 mg oral dose of CBD reduced the salience and pleasantness of cigarette cues, but did not influence tobacco craving or withdrawal or any subjectively rated side effects. 20 Data from these studies with a small number of patients present a positive signal of CBD's potential to treat substance use disorders, but significantly much more research from well-designed clinical trials is needed to support its wide use as treatment for substance use disorder(s).\n",
            " Thus, there is a clear paucity of data from well-designed clinical trials to support the use of CBD for treating anxiety, depression, other neurological complications associated with COVID-19 or substance use disorders. A careful systematic evaluation of CBD in large clinical trials is essential prior to endorsing its wider use for alleviation of mental health symptomatology. It is also of paramount importance that the clinicians treating patients with any of the above COVID-19 related mental or neurological conditions or substance use disorders inform their patients about the lack of sufficient unbiased clinical evidence for the use of CBD and discourage them from using CBD for COVID-19 related health problems during this COVID-19 related severe, unprecedented global health catastrophe.\n",

            " The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an incomparable disease burden worldwide. One of the main contributors stems from the multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The numbers of those affected continue to rise with the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. However, we are yet to fully comprehend the risk factors, disease progression and prognosis for individuals affected. We describe a case of a previously healthy 17-year-old boy who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. He presented with a 5-day history of mild influenza-like symptoms, however, quickly required ventilatory support in the intensive care unit. Two months postdischarge, he developed an isolated petechial rash on his palms and soles. His cutaneous presentation was in association with a mixed sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, debilitating neuropathic pain and intermittent respiratory distress. We postulate that cutaneous manifestations post-COVID-19 could be indicatory of the newly identified multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n",
            " Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, skin manifestations have been associated with SARS-CoV-2, however, it is only now that they have become of increased interest. The most commonly documented have been recently classified into six main patterns, these include; urticarial, confluent erythematous−maculopapular−morbilliform, papulovesicular, chilblain-like acral, livedo reticularis-livedo racemosa-like and purpuric 'vasculitic'. 1 Although the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are unclear, complement activation, hyperactive immune response and microvascular injury have all been implicated.\n",
            " COVID-19-induced cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis refers to a subgroup of vasculitis localised to the skin. The development of cutaneous smallvessel vasculitis can be drug induced or secondary to infection. Vascular damage secondary to heightened immune responses against viral antigen deposition is a recently postulated mechanism of small vessel vasculitis in conjunction with COVID-19 infection. 2 The current hypothesis involves increased angiotensin II levels. 3 ACE 2 is a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and expressed on various human tissues including alveolar pneumocytes, skin keratinocytes and vascular endothelium. The interaction between ACE 2 and the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein results in increased circulating angiotensin II with resultant vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. 3 Herein, we report a case of post-COVID-19 cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis isolated to the palmoplantar skin in association with SARS-CoV-2 multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n",
            " A 17-year-old boy with no underlying medical history presented to our dermatology department after developing an isolated asymptomatic palmoplantar rash. Two months prior, he had attended the emergency department with acute shortness of breath after a 5-day history of mild viral symptoms. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and remained on ventilatory support in the intensive care unit (ICU) for a total of 12 days before being extubated. His post-COVID-19 recovery has been challenging with a new diagnosis of postviral mixed sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, debilitating neuropathic pain and respiratory sequelae. His rash initially developed on the soles of his feet and slowly progressed to his palms. It developed 1 week after receiving a course of intravenous immunoglobulin over 5 days. Naturally, there was a clinical question whether this was a cutaneous side effect of intravenous immunoglobulin or potentially a drug rash secondary to his use of pregabalin, oxcarbazepine or oxycontin. On examination, he had an isolated purpuric rash involving his palms and soles bilaterally (figures 1 and 2), with sparing of his mucosal surfaces. His recent drugs were excluded as a causative factor, as no manifestations of an isolated purpuric palmoplantar rash had been described previously in the literature in association with his medications.\n",
            " Before his consultation, he had undergone investigations for his neurological deficit, with a subsequent diagnosis of a post-SARS-CoV-2 sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy established. \n",
            " Small fibre involvement was the causative factor for his ongoing neuropathic pain.\n",
            " Our patient and his mother deferred a skin biopsy, as a means to establishing a definitive diagnosis. This decision was made on the basis of recent symptoms of post-traumatic stress, secondary to his unexpected ICU admission. It was decided that in this context, a watch and wait approach was more appropriate.\n",
            " One month later, he was followed up with a teledermatology consultation. His palmoplantar rash had not progressed further and had begun to regress. His sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy and neuropathic pain, however, were still problematic but slowly improving. In the interim, he experienced a further episode of acute respiratory distress, requiring urgent assessment in the emergency department. His respiratory symptoms were deemed secondary to postviral inflammatory effects of COVID-19.\n",
            " In the setting of a definitive diagnosis of sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy with small fibre involvement and post-COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, our patient's cutaneous presentation was deemed to be secondary to SARS-CoV-2 induced small vessel vasculitis.\n",
            " The SARS-CoV-2, which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic, can result in a variety of contrasting clinical manifestations among infected individuals. Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 are similarly varied in appearance and do not typically reflect the course of the disease.\n",
            " A purpuric vasculitic pattern is one of the classified COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations. Petechiae are small, subdermal haemorrhages, while purpura is a larger variant. Its presentation is less commonly described in association with COVID-19, compared with some of the other classified rashes and interestingly all cases that are described in the literature spare the palmoplantar skin. This is the first case of a vasculitic pattern isolated to the palmoplantar skin in association with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RNA coronavirus.\n",
            " Case reports of vasculitic rashes in association with COVID-19 are limited in the literature. One case of a petechial rash from Thailand was initially misdiagnosed as dengue fever, however, later the patient was found to be COVID-19 positive when they re-presented with respiratory distress. 4 Other cases have described extensive erythematous macules, papules and petechiae isolated symmetrically to periflexural areas 5 and extensive purpura isolated to flexural areas. 6 Presentations of purpuric features within an extensive morbilliform rash have also been reported, however, also sparing the palmoplantar skin and mucosa. 7 Interestingly, all these patients developed cutaneous features in the acute symptomatic stages of their illness and not in the postviral phase like in our case.\n",
            " It has been suggested that the presentation of a purpuric or petechial rash in conjunction with a positive SARS-CoV-2 result is an indication of a milder form of COVID-19, 8 however, this was not the case for our patient. Unlike case reports in the literature, our patient developed a vasculitic type rash in association with COVID-19 in the postviral phase and again unlike other case reports, had an acute severe life-threatening inflammatory response in conjunction with COVID-19. His palmoplantar petechial rash was deemed secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection as there was no other reasonable cause, especially as he had post-COVID-19 sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy in conjunction with respiratory sequelae.\n",
            " Although the diagnosis of petechiae was established clinically, the histopathology of other petechial rashes in association with COVID-19 has revealed a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, extravasation of red cells and focal papillary oedema. Focal parakeratosis and dyskeratotic cells have also been visualised within the epidermis. Interestingly some have shown signs of pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy with deposition of complement (C5b-9 and C4d) in association with colocalisation of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins, while others show no signs of thrombotic vasculopathy. 9 It is postulated that vascular damage in conjunction with SARS-CoV-2 infection is due to the immune response against viral antigen deposition. 2 There is now a possibility that patients with COVID-19 might initially present with a skin rash in the asymptomatic phase of their illness and be misdiagnosed with another skin disease. It is imperative for clinicians to be wary of patients presenting with an acute rash and to protect themselves adequately with personal protective equipment. As our patient developed his rash in the postviral setting and in conjunction with respiratory sequelae and a mixed sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy as a consequence of COVID-19, we propose that cutaneous skin manifestations in the postviral setting could be an indication of impending multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n",

It should be noted that given the recency of the pandemic, most studies are small case series, so this evaluation should be regarded as preliminary.\n",
            " A review by a panel of the World Stroke Organization reported that the risk of ischemic stroke during COV-ID-19 is around 5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.8-8.7%) [1] . COVID-19-related hemorrhagic strokes are far less common than ischemic strokes, but a few cases have been reported [2] [3] [4] [5] . The median time from diagnosis to ischemic stroke in one small single-center study was 10 days (IQR: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [6] . Patients with COVID-19 who had strokes were more likely to be older and have hypertension and higher levels of D-dimer [1] . Similarly, among 50 patients with ischemic stroke admitted in Wuhan, China, there was more comorbidity, lower platelet counts and leukocyte counts, and the patients had higher levels of Ddimers, cardiac troponin I, NT probrain natriuretic peptide, and interleukin-6 [7] . The strokes are commonly la-beled as cryptogenic. In a retrospective review of 32 patients with COVID-19, 65.6% had cryptogenic stroke compared with 30.4% of contemporary controls (p = 0.003) and 25% of historical controls (p < 0.001). The next most frequent stroke category was cardioembolism (22%) [6] . It should be noted that diagnostic investigations could not be completed in some patients with COVID-19 and this might have contributed to the high rate of cryptogenic strokes.\n",
            " Strokes in patients with COVID-19 may be due to usual causes such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. In this review, however, we focus on mechanisms of stroke that appear to be directly related to CO-VID- 19 . It seems likely that these COVID-19-related mechanisms would also increase the risk of stroke in infected persons who harbor the more conventional stroke risk factors.\n",
            " Three main mechanisms appear to be responsible for the occurrence of ischemic strokes in COVID-19 [8, 9] (Fig. 1 ). These include a hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and cardiomyopathy. While the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic strokes in the setting of COVID-19 has not been 2 DOI: 10.1159/000509581 fully elucidated, it is possible that the affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 receptors, which are expressed in endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells in the brain, allows the virus to damage intracranial arteries, causing vessel wall rupture [10] . In addition, it is possible that the cytokine storm that accompanies this disorder could be the cause of hemorrhagic strokes, as reported in a CO-VID-19 patient who developed an acute necrotizing encephalopathy associated with late parenchymal brain hemorrhages [4] . This massive release of cytokines may also damage and result in breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and cause hemorrhagic posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [11] . Secondary hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic strokes has also been reported in COVID-19 patients [3, 12] . Such transformation may occur in the setting of endothelial damage or a consumption coagulopathy accompanying COVID-19 [12] .\n",
            " Lee et al. [13] reported that 20-55% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have laboratory evidence of coagulopathy, with increased levels of D-dimer to above twice normal, slight prolongation of prothrombin time (1-3 s above normal), mild thrombocytopenia, and in late disease, decreased fibrinogen levels. A D-dimer level above 4 times normal was associated with a 5-fold increase in the likelihood of critical illness.\n",
            " Thachil et al. [14] published guidance on recognition and management of coagulopathy in COVID-19 from the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis. They recommended monitoring of prothrombin time, Ddimer, platelet count, and fibrinogen and prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular weight (LMW) heparin in all patients with COVID-19. Yaghi et al. [6] reported that high levels of D-dimer were more common among patients with stroke and COVID-19 and suggested that hypercoagulability may underly much of stroke in this disease. They indicated that a randomized trial of therapeutic anticoagulation versus prophylactic anticoagulation is underway.\n",
            " Antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin and anti-β-glycoprotein I antibodies) have been documented in COVID-19 patients with multiple hemispheric infarcts and with concomitant elevation of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, D-dimer, and CRP [15] . The lupus anticoagulant was reported to be present in 45% of patients with COVID-19 versus only 10% with anticardiolipin antibody in a study in France (n = 50) [16] . In another study, the lupus anticoagulant was documented in 31 of 34 (91%) COVID-19 patients who had an elevated aPTT, but the frequency of venous thromboembolism was low in this group (2 patients; 6%) [17] . The significance of these findings is unclear as antiphospholipid antibodies were present in subjects with multiple other features of hypercoagulability, and the isolated finding of lupus anticoagulant was not associated with high risk of thromboembolism.\n",
            " In some patients, the combination of thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, increased D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and decreased fibrinogen concentrations is consistent with consumption coagulopathy that typically occurs in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Postmortem studies in patients dying of COVID-19 show microvascular platelet-fibrinrich thrombotic depositions in the lungs as well as in other organs [18] [19] [20] . It has been suggested that viral invasion of the vascular endothelium triggers activation of the contact and complement systems which, in turn, initiates thrombotic and inflammatory cascades leading to internal organ injury [19, 21] . Weidman et al. [22] reviewed the role of inflammation in thrombosis (Fig. 2 ).\n",
            " While the relevance of microvascular thrombosis is becoming increasingly clear, a substantial proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 also develop large vessel occlusion. Although in situ thrombosis has been postulated (1) The inflammation kallikrein-kinin pathway by converting plasma prekallikrein (PPK) into active plasma kallikrein (PK), which cleaves both FXII into FXIIa and high molecular weight kininogen (HK) to bradykinin (BK). The latter binds to kinin receptors (B2 and B1 receptors) and triggers inflammation. (2) The complement system by activation of the C1qrs complex subunits C1r and C1s leading formation of the membrane attack complex by the classical complement pathway. (3) The fibrinolytic system by PK activation of prourokinase into urokinase that in turn cleaves plasminogen into plasmin, an enzyme that degrades fibrin clots. (4) The intrinsic coagulation pathway by FXI activation into FXIa leading to thrombin activation and fibrin generation. The contact system is controlled mainly by C1 inhibitor (C1-Inh) that inhibits both FXIIa and PK. Other endogenous inhibitors including antithrombin III (ATIII), α-2-macroglobulin (α2M), and α-2antiplasmin (α2AP) contribute in controlling contact system proteases and new synthetic \"exogenous\" inhibitors have been developed to interfere with contact system-mediated diseases. Green arrows indicate activation, and red arrows inhibition. Protein in bold is the result of proteolytic cleavage of their precursors. Boxed text indicates pathways (underlined) and related disease states to cause large artery occlusion, this seems unlikely. Red thrombus forms in the setting of stasis; it contains more entrapped red blood cells and less platelets. White thrombus, which forms in the setting of fast flow/high shear rates, contains less entrapped red blood cells and more platelet aggregates [23] [24] [25] . Red thrombus in large arteries probably forms only after a plaque rupture or arterial dissection and in fusiform aneurysms. Many of the patients with large artery occlusion have been younger patients with no vascular risk factors, so unlikely to have large plaques with plaque rupture. Bangalore et al. [26] report that 33% of COVID-19 patients with myocardial infarction did not have obstructive coronary artery disease. At Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, after thrombectomy, most of the large arteries with occlusive thrombus appeared normal (M. Alberts, personal communication, May 28, 2020). Escalard et al. [27] reported that among 10 patients with stroke and COVID-19, 5 had large artery occlusions in multiple vascular territories. This suggests that large artery occlusion in COVID-19 may be mainly cardioembolic/paradoxical.\n",
            " In 2 studies, deep venous thrombosis occurred in 20-25% of patients admitted to critical care [28, 29] , and in another study this occurred despite prophylaxis with LMW heparin. Klok et al. [30] reported that despite prophylaxis with LMW heparin, 31% of the 100 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU had an arterial (3.7%) or venous (96.3%) thrombotic manifestation; all arterial events were strokes, and 81% of all thrombotic events were pulmonary emboli. They suggested that prophylaxis should be implemented with higher than usual doses of LMW heparin. In a recent autopsy study of 12 cases from Germany, fresh thrombus in the deep venous system was detected in 7; in addition, there was a fresh thrombus in the prostatic venous plexus in 6 cases [31] . In a French study, 79% of 34 patients admitted to the ICU had DVT at 48 h after admission [32] . These findings suggest that paradoxical embolism could be a plausible mechanism of stroke in some patients with COVID-19 coagulopathy. Indeed, paradoxical embolism may account for some or many of the large artery ischemic strokes in young people, including extracranial occlusion of the common and internal carotid artery [33] .\n",
            " for the ACE2 receptors that are expressed in the lungs, heart, kidneys, and small bowel. These receptors are also abundant in the vascular endothelium [34] , where infec-tion elicits an inflammatory response (a lymphocytic \"endotheliitis\") [18] that has been postulated as one of the substrates for the thrombotic complications of this infection. In a recent pathological study in patients with CO-VID-19 infection (2 autopsies and 1 surgical biopsy), Varga et al. [18] documented viral inclusions in endothelial cells in the kidneys, heart, lungs, and small bowel, with associated widespread endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis. The authors speculated that a virus-induced state of systemic impaired microcirculatory function in different vascular beds may form the basis for the multiorgan failure that characterizes the severe cases of COVID-19. Vessels may not only be inflamed by a direct local effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the ACE2 receptors in the vascular endothelium but also by a systemic immune response to the pathogen (\"cytokine storm\"). In the case of COVID-19, several cytokines, including IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1 have been found to be markedly elevated, especially in patients with severe disease and high rates of mortality [35] .\n",
            " Ackermann et al. [36] reported an autopsy series of 7 cases of COVID-19 compared with 7 cases of influenza. They noted that distinctive pulmonary features in COV-ID-19 included diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration, severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes, widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy, and angiogenesis [36] .\n",
            " The role that these various vascular and immune-mediated factors play in the pathogenesis of stroke in CO-VID-19 patient remains unclear. More data are needed regarding angiographic and postmortem studies of the cervical-cerebral vasculature in order to evaluate the presence and magnitude of vasculitis and its potential role in in-situ clot formation as a potential mechanism of ischemic stroke. It seems unlikely that angiography will disclose an endotheliitis, although it may show large vessel occlusion. The large vessel occlusions are also in atypical locations, such as extensive thrombus emanating from the common carotid artery. Whether such large artery thrombi form at the site, or are embolic, remains to be determined. As discussed above and below, it seems likely that some or many of the large artery occlusions may be embolic.\n",
            " The clinical stroke observations have included instances in which predominantly large-vessel territorial infarcts have occurred in subjects with conventional risk factors (age, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic heart disease) who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and had high levels of inflammatory markers (such as CRP and ferritin) and markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis (such as D-dimer, fibrinogen, and lupus anticoagulant) [9] . The vascular images provided were indicative of large vessel occlusion without features to suggest an alternative mechanism such as multifocal or widespread vascular wall inflammation (vasculitis). A recent report from Italy compared stroke patients with (n = 43) and without (n = 68) COVID-19. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, and vascular risk factors were similar between the 2 groups [37] . Hemorrhagic strokes were less common in COVID-19 patients (7.0 vs. 13.4%). However, initial stroke severity, measured by the NIHSS, was greater in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients (10 vs. 4), suggesting involvement of large vessels. Unfortunately, neither vessel images nor stroke subtype classification were reported. Other small series have confirmed cases of large vessel vascular occlusion, and some authors have stressed a high frequency of stroke in young COV-ID-19 subjects (ages 33-49) with a low prevalence of conventional stroke risk factors and elevated markers of inflammation (ferritin) and coagulation (D-dimer and fibrinogen) [8] . The high frequency of ischemic stroke in young subjects with COVID-19 and a paucity of vascular risk factors raises the possibility that mechanisms peculiar to COVID-19 may be responsible. These could include abnormalities in the vascular endothelium related to direct viral invasion and inflammation (\"endotheliitis\"), along with the results of a \"cytokine storm\" (commonly observed in this patient group).\n",
            " A virus-induced prothrombotic state may play an additional role, potentially synergistic, in the pathogenesis of ischemic strokes of all types in COVID-19 patients. An additional prothrombotic factor is impaired endothelial expression of heparan sulfate, which promotes thrombosis [37] . It is clear that more data in this area are required in order to establish more precisely the potential contribution of these various processes in the pathogenesis of stroke in COVID-19 patients.\n",
            " There are a number of mechanisms for cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients [38] [39] [40] . There may be direct invasion by the virus, causing a myocarditis, with resultant injury and even death of cardiomyocytes. This may due to the affinity of the virus for ACE2, a membrane-bound aminopeptidase, which acts as a portal of viral entry, and downregulation of ACE2, leading to myocardial dysfunction [36] . The heart may also be indirectly affected by the systemic inflammatory state during the severe phase of the infection related to the cytokine storm where many \"bystander\" end-organs are damaged [40] .\n",
            " There is also increased cardiac stress due to respiratory failure and hypoxemia from the infection, leading to stress cardiomyopathy. An additional possible mechanism for cardiac damage in COVID-19 is stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, predisposing to stress cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias [41, 42] . These may lead to arrhythmias and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The consequent intracardiac thrombus formation, possibly compounded by the hypercoagulable states, raises the risk of subsequent cardioembolic stroke. Some of the published case series of stroke during CO-VID- 19 have not evaluated cardioembolic mechanisms [8, 9] .\n",
            " An early report from China and the previous report from Singapore on SARS-CoV-1 infection developing stroke during that 2002-2003 outbreak demonstrated cardioembolic mechanisms in 36 and 60% of their cases, respectively [43] . Yaghi et al. [6] reported that stroke patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be young men with elevated troponin levels compared with historical controls.\n",
            " All patients admitted to intensive care should receive prophylaxis against venous thrombosis, with at least LMW heparin [14] . In patients with stroke, a cardioembolic mechanism should be strongly suspected, and if there are findings to support that suspicion, such as infarction in multiple cerebral vascular territories (or systemic and cerebral emboli), cardiomyopathy with significant ventricular dyskinesia, atrial fibrillation, or right-toleft shunt, the patient should probably receive therapeutic doses of anticoagulation [44] .\n",
            " A theoretical consideration, based on the experience of Klok et al. [30] , is that perhaps DOACs (which target only one clotting factor) might be less effective than heparin or warfarin, which target multiple clotting factors [45, 46] . Warfarin interferes with the synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, and X [47] . Atarashi et al. [46] suggested that the reason warfarin causes more intracerebral hemorrhage is that it targets factor VII. It seems likely that interference with multiple clotting factors may be why warfarin is more effective than DOACs in patients with mechanical heart valves [48] [49] [50] .\n",
            " Tang et al. [51] reported that anticoagulation reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy. In reply, Asakura and Ogawa [52] noted that some features 6 DOI: 10.1159/000509581 of the coagulopathy in COVID-19 suggest DIC and recommended a combination of heparin and nafamostat mesylate, a treatment used for DIC in Japan. Thachil et al. [53] responded with a discussion of possible benefits of unfractionated heparin versus LMW heparin.\n",
            " Besides anticoagulation, there may be reason to consider thrombolytic therapy. Wang et al. [54] suggested from a small case series that tissue plasminogen activator may be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-10.\n",
            " Based on their benefit as anti-inflammatory agents in cardiovascular clinical trials, therapies such as IL-6R monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab), TNF-α inhibitors (etanercept and infliximab), and IL-1β antagonists (the monoclonal antibody canakinumab and the anti-cytokine anakinra) have been suggested as potentially beneficial for COVID-19 patients [55] . However, the main concern related to the use of immunosuppression, including corticosteroids, is that it may delay the elimination of the virus [56] and increase the risk of secondary infection, especially in those with an impaired immune system [57] .\n",
            " Though there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials, anti-inflammatory agents, including corticosteroids, are empirically used for severe complications in patients with COVID-19, such as ARDS, and acute cardiac and renal involvement [58] . Whether systemic corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory agents can be of value in the selected cases of stroke in which vasculitis is suspected is a matter of debate. Neurologists should carefully balance the risk and benefit ratio before starting anti-inflammatory therapies.\n",
            " Beigel et al. [59] reported that in a randomized controlled trial in 1,059 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, remdesivir was associated with a shorter median recovery time (11 days, 95% CI: 9-12), compared with placebo (15 days, 95% CI: [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , and a lower 14-day mortality of 7.1% with remdesivir versus 11.9% with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.47-1.04). Stroke was not mentioned in the report.\n",
            " The list of clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov can be found at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results? cond = COVID-19. Important therapeutic targets in these trials include virus neutralization, prevention and treatment of thrombotic complications, and inhibition of the cytokine storm. Such trials test a wide range of therapies from convalescent and hyperimmune plasma for virus neutralization to tissue plasminogen activator for treatment of microvascular thrombosis and from hemodialysis with reconditioning of immune cells to complement inhibitors, selective cytokine inhibitors, and colchicine to prevent the cytokine storm, based on a study on coronary artery disease [60] .\n",
            " A number of mechanisms are involved in stroke in COVID-19, including a hypercoagulable state, DIC, necrotizing encephalopathy, vasculitis, and cardiomyopathy. It seems likely that anticoagulation will play a substantial role in the management of stroke in COVID-19. Further evidence is needed from larger studies.\n",

            " COVID-19 is an ever-evolving disease that the medical community continues to learn more about daily. It is important to highlight important clinical courses that are not common so that adverse events can be better predicted and treated appropriately. In a retrospective study done in a hospital out of Wuhan, China in February 2020 showed that out of its 99 patients, only one patient had pneumothorax. 1 Later, in March 2020, a literature review published in the American Journal of Roentgenology of more than 900 patients described the incidence of pneumothorax as uncommon or rare. 2 Pneumomediastinum is far less appreciated. A literature search of PubMed reveals only five case reports of pneumomediastinum, mostly originating from China, in the absence of positive pressure ventilation. 3À7 Presented below is a case series from a county hospital in Long Island, New York on three patients diagnosed with pneumomediastinum in the absence of positive pressure ventilation. These cases are significant because they all involve non-smokers with no underlying pulmonary disease, the absence of positive pressure ventilation and delayed presentation (two weeks or more) after hospital admission.\n",
            " A 51-year-old obese Hispanic male, non-smoker with no significant medical history was admitted with three days of cough, chills and dyspnea. On admission, his temperature was 103 degrees Fahrenheit and oxygen saturation was 88% on nonrebreather mask (NRB) 15 L/min. He was found to have severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia, with a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of 68. Admission laboratory results revealed normal white blood cell count, C-reactive protein elevated at 10.1 mg/dL (Normal 0.0À0.9 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase elevated at 439 U/L (Normal 120À246 U/L), Ddimer elevated at 0.40 ug/mL (Normal < 0.4 ug/mL) and ferritin elevated at 489 ng/mL (Normal 7.3À270.7 ng/mL). His chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates. He was treated with a course of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and methylprednisolone. He received tocilizumab and convalescent plasma. He continued to require 15 L/min NRB mask to maintain his oxygenation. On day 15 of his hospitalization, he developed sudden chest pain and worsening hypoxemia. Chest x-ray showed right sided apical pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum (Fig. 1 ). He had a chest tube placed with improvement in his oxygenation. His pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum resolved after which chest tube was removed. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on oxygen therapy 3 L/min nasal cannula. He had a CT thorax done 8 weeks later which showed peripheral ground glass opacities with bronchiectasis. No significant underlying bullous lung disease was noted.\n",
            " A 37-year-old obese, Hispanic male, non-smoker with no significant medical history was admitted with five days of cough, fever, and dyspnea. On admission, he was afebrile, tachycardic with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 92% on NRB 15 L/min. He was found to have severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia, with a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of 80. Admission laboratory results revealed normal white blood cell count, acute kidney injury with creatinine 1.7 mg/dL. C-reactive protein elevated at 5.5 mg/dL (Normal 0.0À0.9 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase elevated at 738 U/L (Normal 120À246 U/L), D-dimer elevated at 1.29 ug/mL dL (Normal < 0.4 ug/mL) and ferritin elevated at 480 ng/mL (Normal 7.3À270.7 ng/mL). His chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates. He was treated with a course of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and methylprednisolone. He received tocilizumab and convalescent plasma. He continued to require 15 L/min NRB mask to maintain his oxygenation. On day 14 of his hospitalization, he had persistent hypoxemia requiring 15 L/min NRB and 6 L/min nasal cannula. Chest x-ray showed pneumomediastinum (Fig. 2) . He had a CT thorax done which showed complete ground glass opacification of bilateral lungs, diffuse pneumomediastinum, and small amount of pneumopericardium. No significant underlying bullous lung disease was noted. He was managed conservatively, and was noted to have slowly decreasing oxygen requirements. He was discharged home after a 27-day hospitalization on 2 L/min nasal cannula oxygen. He was followed up in a pulmonary clinic with continued improvement in his symptoms. A repeat chest x-ray showed persistent pneumomediastinum and significant improvement in bilateral consolidations.\n",
            " A 34-year-old Hispanic male, non-smoker with no significant medical history was admitted with two-week history of non-productive cough, diarrhea, non-bloody, non-bilious emesis and subjective fevers. On admission, he was afebrile, tachycardic with a heart rate of 140 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 90% on room air and 99% on 4 L/min nasal cannula. He was found to have severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia, with a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of 59. Admission laboratory results revealed normal white blood cell count, lymphocytopenia of 6%. C-reactive protein elevated at 26.9 mg/dL (Normal 0.0À0.9 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase elevated at 353 U/L (Normal 120À246 U/L), D-dimer elevated at 0.66 ug/mL (Normal < 0.4 ug/mL) and ferritin elevated at 478 ng/ mL (Normal 7.3À270.7 ng/mL). His chest x-ray revealed bilateral diffuse infiltrates. A CT scan for pulmonary embolism was done by the emergency department to rule out pulmonary embolism revealed patchy bilateral pulmonary consolidation and no evidence of filling defects. There was also no evidence of bullous lung disease. He was treated with a course of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and methylprednisolone. He received tocilizumab and convalescent plasma. His hypoxia worsened during the hospital course, eventually requiring 15 L/min NRB mask and 6 L/min nasal cannula to maintain his oxygenation. On day 18 of his hospitalization, he had persistent hypoxemia with worsening respiratory distress. Patient refused intubation. During the hospital course, he was managed conservatively, and was noted to have slowly decreasing oxygen requirements. On hospital day 36, he developed pneumomediastinum (Fig. 3) likely secondary to violent coughing, which eventually improved with conservative management. Chest x-ray done prior to discharge revealed significant improvement in bilateral consolidations and resolution of pneumomediastinum. After six weeks since hospital admission, the patient was discharged home on 2 L/min nasal cannula. Discussion COVID-19 is a complex disease and due to its recent emergence, continued research is being done to fully understand the pathophysiology behind it. Pneumomediastinum is thought to be caused by an increase in pressure in the alveoli, due to various etiologies, which in turn causes the alveoli to rupture. This air then travels through the perivascular sheath and toward the mediastinum. 8 Current research shows that pneumomediastinum is a rare complication of COVID-19. Patients in our case series had no prior risk factors for developing pneumomediastinum and were not being treated by positive pressure ventilation. This is in contrast to a recent published case series by Volpi et al 9 where patients received positive pressure ventilation. Although usually benign, this can potentially lead to further problems including tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, significant subcutaneous emphysema, or pneumorrhachis. 8 Therefore, pneumomediastinum should be closely monitored since it can lead to cardiorespiratory compromise due to diminished cardiac output by direct cardiac compression or reduced venous return. We emphasize that pneumomediastinum should be in the differential diagnosis in patients with severe SARS-COV2 pneumonia, who develop new symptoms of chest pain and worsening shortness of breath. Repeat chest radiographs should be taken in these patients to recognize pneumomediastinum. Conservative management usually is the treatment of choice, although cardiorespiratory compromise can occur and caution should be warranted. The exact mechanism for which pneumomediastinum occurs in COVID-19 patients still remains unclear. Further research in this area should be conducted.\n",
