            "Body Text: that small molecules produced by human-associated bacteria can affect not only host cells but also coinhabiting organisms of the microbiome (5, 6) . While many studies have focused on identifying microbiota-encoded metabolites that affect either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells, there are comparatively few examples of commensal metabolites that affect viral infection of host cells (7, 8) . Given that bacteria populate body sites that are frequently exposed to viruses, we sought to determine whether commensal bacteria encode metabolites that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",
            " Culture broth extracts from 50 phylogenetically diverse and commonly seen commensal bacteria were screened in a cell-based assay for the ability to inhibit infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2. Bioassay-guided fractionation and structure elucidation of the antiviral activities detected in this extract library led to our identification of three metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. These include the adenosine analogue N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)adenosine (IPA), the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HTR) agonist tryptamine, and the pyrazine 2,5-bis(3-indolylmethyl)pyrazine (BIP). Interestingly, there are clear structural and functional parallels between commensal bacteria-encoded and synthetic anti-SARS-CoV-2 active small molecules, as synthetic nucleosides, 5-HTR signaling modulators, and pyrazines have all been examined in either COVID-19 clinical trials or observational studies (e.g., remdesivir, fluvoxamine, and favipiravir, respectively) (9) (10) (11) . The identification of multiple commensal bacteria-encoded metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in this study suggests that the human microbiota likely represents an underexplored reservoir of antiviral small molecules.\n",
            " Creation and screening of a microbiome metabolite library. Although the human microbiome is composed of thousands of unique strains, metabolic redundancy across related bacteria suggests that examining a phylogenetically diverse subset of commensal bacteria is likely to uncover many of the common biologically active molecules that are produced by the microbiota (12) . For this study, we selected 50 strains cultured from body sites most likely to come in contact with viruses (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and skin) and distributed across the major phyla present in the human microbiome (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria). We sampled species from genera that are highly represented (e.g., Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides), as well as from those with only a small number of commensal species (e.g., Megasphaera, Coprobacillus), which allowed us to expand the phylogenetic diversity of our collection. Each strain was grown as a monoculture under the appropriate oxygen environment. After incubating at 37°C for 7 days, extracellular metabolites from these cultures were collected on Amberlite XAD7HP polymeric adsorbent. Resin-bound metabolites were then eluted to yield a library of crude bacterial extracts associated with a diverse collection of human-associated bacteria. In order to facilitate bioactive small-molecule discovery, we performed a prefractionation procedure on each extract in which the crude sample was partitioned by reverse-phase chromatography into 4 subfractions of increasing hydrophobicity (Fig. 1a) . The resulting extract fractions were tested at concentrations equivalent to a 25-fold (high) and an 8-fold (low) culture broth concentrate in an in vitro cell-based SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) infection assay.\n",
            " At the higher testing concentration (a 25-fold concentrate of culture broth), 10 bacteria produced at least 1 fraction that reduced viral infection to less than 10% (Fig. 1b) . To determine which of these activities were the result of individual antiviral metabolites instead of nonspecific inhibition due to the complex mixture of metabolites in the extract, each fraction that showed .90% inhibition was further partitioned by C-18 semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the resulting fractions were subject to another round of antiviral screening. Extracts from cultures of 4 bacteria (Ruminococcus gnavus, Prevotella nigrescens, Bacteroides caccae, and Micrococcus luteus) generated discrete antiviral-active HPLC fractions, from which individual anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolite(s) were purified and structurally characterized (Fig. 1b) .\n",
            " Characterization of microbiome-encoded SARS-CoV-2 active antivirals. (i) SARS-CoV-2 active pyrazines. Partitioning of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 active fraction from a culture of M. luteus SK58 that was isolated from a human skin sample (Human Microbiome Project [HMP] ID 569) (13) revealed a major antiviral active compound and a second HPLC peak with a similar UV trace but only minimal anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Structural elucidation of these two compounds by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) indicated that the FIG 1 Screening of human-associated bacteria for the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolites.

To confirm these structures, BIP and IMP standards were synthesized from a-amino aldehydes using existing methods for producing pyrazine alkaloids (14) . Based on NMR and HR-MS, the synthetic and natural materials were spectroscopically identical ( Fig. S3 and S4 ). In dose-response testing against SARS-COV-2 infection of Huh-7.5 cells, purified BIP had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 70 mM (Fig. 1b) , while IMP displayed much weaker antiviral activity (IC 50 . 250 mM) (Fig. S5 ). Neither compound displayed significant cytotoxicity (CC 50 . 250 mM).\n",
            " (ii) SARS-CoV-2 active tryptamine. NMR and HR-MS data indicated that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolite produced by R. gnavus CC55_001C that was isolated from a colonic biopsy specimen (HMP ID 1201) (13) was tryptamine (Fig. S6 ). Its identity and activity were confirmed using a commercial tryptamine standard. R. gnavus is a well-established producer of tryptamine through the decarboxylation of tryptophan, a reaction that cannot be carried out by the human host (15) . It is a member of the microbiota of most children and adults and overrepresented in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (16) .\n",
            " In dose-response testing against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Huh-7.5 cells, tryptamine had an IC 50 of 33 mM (Fig. 1b) , with some loss in cell viability observed at the highest concentration tested (250 mM). Tryptamine is found in human feces at concentrations generally ranging from 10 to 25 mM and as high as 50 mM in some individuals (17) , making its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection within this same concentration range intriguing. Tryptamine is a potent agonist of a number of serotonin G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (5-hydroxytryptamine receptors ) and is especially active against HTR2C and HTR5A (50% effective concentration [EC 50 ], 70 nM) (5). Although we do not know whether the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of tryptamine was due to its 5-HTR agonism, a number of synthetic 5-HTR modulators have been reported to exert antiviral activity against other viruses. For example, the 5-HTR agonist 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT) reduces reovirus entry in vitro (18) , while the 5-HTR antagonist methiothepin mesylate (MM) was reported to inhibit Chikungunya virus replication (19) . To explore the relevance of 5-HTRs modulators to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assayed MM and 5-NT for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Both MM (IC 50 , 2.8 mM) and 5-NT (IC 50 , 70 mM) exhibited antiviral activity (Fig. 2) , illustrating that either agonism or antagonism of 5-HTR receptors can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. (iii) SARS-CoV-2 active N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)adenosine. Fractions from extracts of P. nigrescens CC14M that was identified in colonic biopsy specimen (HMP ID 1173) (13) and B. caccae CL03T12C61 cultured from a human fecal sample (HMP ID 1061) (13) yielded SARS-CoV-2 active metabolites with identical HPLC retention times, UV spectra, and masses (m/z = 336.1672). Structural elucidation by NMR and HR-MS identified these metabolites as the N 6 -modified adenosine derivative N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)adenosine (IPA) (Fig. S7) . Comparison of the natural compound to a commercial standard confirmed IPA as the active metabolite produced by both bacteria. Purified IPA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of Huh-7.5 cells with an IC 50 of 2 mM (Fig. 1b) , which is as potent or more potent than a number of repurposed drugs that have been explored as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, IC 50 , 2 mM; ribavirin, IC 50 , 30 mM; and favipiravir, IC 50 . 100 mM). Notably, IPA also displayed cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 ], 12 mM), something that is often observed with antiviral nucleoside analogues (20) .\n",
            " As IPA was the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolite we identified, we sought to probe its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in more detail. A common mode of action of nucleoside-based antivirals is incorporation into the product RNA strand by viral RNAdependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) (21, 22) . We, therefore, hypothesized that IPA might be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Nucleoside antivirals are prodrugs that must first be phosphorylated in vivo in order to function as RdRp substrates (23) . The ability of mammalian cells to phosphorylate IPA was examined by incubating HEK293 cells with IPA (10 mM, 3 h) and monitoring the intracellular concentration of the nucleoside and its phosphorylated derivative using negative ionization HR-MS. Similar to the control nucleoside antiviral remdesivir, we observed the appearance of IPA 59-monophosphate (p-IPA) in IPA-treated cells (Fig. 3a) , indicating that IPA, like other nucleoside antivirals, is phosphorylated by eukaryotic cells.\n",
            " Remdesivir, which is approved for the treatment of severe COVID-19, is efficiently incorporated as an ATP analog into the product RNA strand during SARS-CoV-2 RdRpcatalyzed RNA synthesis (24) . The resulting product RNA can then serve as the template strand, which, at intracellular nucleoside concentrations, leads to template-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (25) . To test if the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp can incorporate IPA into the product RNA strand, we synthetically triphosphorylated IPA to yield N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)ATP (ppp-IPA) (26) . In vitro RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp from a template RNA strand (27) (Fig. 3b ) was then used to assess the enzyme's ability to incorporate ppp-IPA. The corresponding triphosphate of remdesivir (ppp-RDV) was used as a positive control. In this assay, the addition of UTP to begin RNA synthesis of a \"AAUUUUAG. . .\"-containing template strand resulted in the formation of the 12 product (Fig. 3c, lane 2 ). Further addition of ATP formed the 17 product (Fig. 3c, lane 3) . Addition of the RNA chain terminator 39-dATP (dATP) forms a 13 product, though the full 17 product could be recovered by the simultaneous addition of ATP (Fig. 3c , lanes 4 to 5). Addition of either ppp-IPA or ppp-RDV resulted in the formation of the 17 RNA product whether ATP was present or not, confirming that ppp-IPA, like ppp-RDV (24), is successfully incorporated into the growing RNA product as an ATP analog by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Fig. 3c , lanes 6 to 9; Fig. S8 ). IPA may have other targets beyond the viral RdRp. Certain N 6 -modified nucleosides, for example, can interfere with canonical base pairing (28) . This provides an alternate mechanism for viral inhibition, with a buildup of mutations resulting in lethal mutagenesis, as seen with other nucleoside antivirals such as ribavirin (29) . Mutagenesis as a result of base pair mismatching could also help explain the cytotoxicity exhibited by IPA. Additionally, although nucleoside antivirals are best known for being incorporated by RNA polymerase, other targets, such as RNA capping enzymes, exist (30) and cannot be ruled out as possible targets of IPA. While the incorporation of IPA during SARS-CoV-2-mediated RNA synthesis does not preclude the possibility that it may be imparting antiviral activity through other pathways, it is nonetheless interesting that the naturally occurring nucleoside antiviral IPA can, like the clinically used antiviral remdesivir, be readily incorporated during RNA synthesis.\n",
            " Structure-activity relationship of microbiome-derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolites. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of each anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolite was explored using collections of naturally occurring related structures. For IPA, we tested adenine and adenosine, as well as several N-modified adenine and adenosine derivatives (Fig. S9a) . None of these, including the closely related trans-zeatin riboside, displayed antiviral activity (IC 50 . 250 mM) ( Table 1) . Although diverse nucleoside structures are used as antivirals, IPA appears to have unique anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity among closely related, naturally occurring nucleosides. We explored the SAR of tryptamine's anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity using a panel of natural tryptamine analogs, as well as the structurally related trace amines tyramine and phenylethylamine, all of which are known bacterial metabolites (Fig. S9b ) (31) (32) (33) . While both natural (e.g., bufotenine) and synthetic (e.g., 5-NT) tryptamine derivatives have been reported to have antiviral activity (18, 34, 35) , among the closely related bacterial metabolites we tested, tryptamine was uniquely active against SARS-CoV-2. 2,5-Disubstituted pyrazines arise from the coupling of two amino acids (36) , and thus, the production of a large number of disubstituted pyrazines is possible from proteinogenic amino acids. As the anti-SARS-CoV-2 active pyrazine BIP contained two indole groups, we focused our SAR analysis on testing the relevance of indole to antiviral activity. To do this, we synthesized the phenylalanine-derived analogs of BIP and IMP, 2,5-bis(phenylmethyl)pyrazine (BPP) and 2-(phenylmethyl)-5-methylpyrazine (PMP), and assayed them for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Neither was active in the concentration range we tested (Table 1 ; Fig. S9c ). Once again, the naturally occurring compound we isolated was the most active among the closely related structures we tested.\n",
            " Activity against other viruses. We tested all three microbiome-derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolites for activity against a panel of RNA viruses, including the seasonal coronavirus HCoV-229E, yellow fever virus 17D (YFV 17D), and human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV-3). These are representative of both positive-sense single-strand RNA (1ssRNA) viruses (HCoV-229E, YFV 17D) and negative-sense single-strand RNA (2ssRNA) viruses (hPIV-3). As with SARS-CoV-2, all viral infections were carried out using Huh-7.5 cells.\n",
            " IPA displayed broad antiviral activity (IC 50 , 2 to 13 mM). It was most potent against the three 1ssRNA viruses (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, and YFV 17D) with roughly the same IC 50 (2 mM to 4 mM) against each (Fig. 4a) . Although less potent, it also inhibited infection by the lone 2ssRNA virus we tested, hPIV-3 (IC 50 , 13 mM). Tryptamine showed a narrower spectrum of activity (Fig. 4b) . It was most active against the two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 (IC 50 , 33 mM) and HCoV-229E (IC 50 , 50 mM), and less effective against the 2ssRNA virus hPIV-3 (IC 50 218 mM). Despite also being a 1ssRNA virus, tryptamine was almost five times less active against YFV 17D (IC 50 , 158 mM) than it was against SARS-CoV-2. Like IPA, BIP displayed similar antiviral activity against the three 1ssRNA viruses, with IC 50 s of 12, 20, and 70 mM against HCoV-229E, YFV 17D, and SARS-CoV-2, respectively (Fig. 4c) . It was inactive against the only 2ssRNA virus, hPIV-3. Among IPA, tryptamine, and BIP, tryptamine was unique in its ability to preferably inhibit coronavirus infections.\n",
            " Production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolites by commensal strains and the human microbiome. Contrary to what has traditionally been seen in the search for bioactive small molecules from bacteria derived from other ecosystems (e.g., soil), IPA and tryptamine are not specialized metabolites that arise from complex and rare biosynthetic gene clusters. Similar to many of the bioactive molecules that have been characterized from the human microbiota (37, 38), these metabolites instead arise from primary metabolic and catabolic pathways. To look for production of antiviral metabolites by other commensal bacteria, we used HR-MS to track the presence of these metabolites in the 50 culture broth extracts we originally screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity ( Fig. 5 ; Table S1 ). In the case of IPA, in addition to the two strains from which it was originally characterized, it was also produced in a high titer by Bacteroides fragilis CL07T00C01. IPA was produced at a detectable level most frequently by strains from the Bacteroidetes phylum, with half of the Bacteroidetes strains we examined producing IPA. The frequent production of IPA by Bacteroidetes strains was surprising given that previous reports of bacteria producing high levels IPA, other than as a tRNA constituent, are quite rare (39) . Tryptamine is a commonly identified metabolite in human fecal samples (17) . Among the strains we examined, it was produced in the highest titer by R. gnavus but was also detected at lower levels in extracts from a number of other bacteria ( Fig. 5) . Although taxonomically diverse bacteria, including Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes (36, 40, 41) , have been reported to produce smaller pyrazine-based natural products, and contrary to IPA and tryptamine, which are produced by a number of bacteria in our collection, BIP and IMP were only produced at detectable levels by M. luteus. While tryptamine is ubiquitous in human stool samples, the production of IPA, BIP, and IMP by the human microbiome is not well described. To probe for the in vivo production of these metabolites, we looked for tandem mass spectra matching IPA, BIP, or IMP in metabolite extract data from fecal and tissue samples submitted to the GNPS, an open-access metabolomics repository (42) . In a number of fecal and tissue samples collected from both mice and humans, we identified tandem mass spectra matching IPA. The detection of IPA in these samples suggests that its production by microbiome-derived bacteria in the laboratory was not merely a by-product of in vitro fermentation methods. One human fecal data set was found to contain a spectral match to BIP and IMP. The rarity of these metabolites in stool samples may be explained by a lack of bacterial producers that are native to the gut. Among the strains we examined, the only producing strain, M. luteus, is not found in the gut but, rather, is an aerobic bacterium commonly observed in the skin microbiome (43) .\n",
            " In our survey of culture broth extracts from bacteria isolated from human samples, we identified three structurally diverse metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Of the metabolites we identified, IPA displayed the most potent antiviral activity, and tryptamine, while less potent, was effective in the concentration range commonly seen in the human gut. All three metabolites are either structurally and/or functionally related to synthetic FDA-approved drugs that have been tested in either COVID-19 clinical trials or observational studies (Fig. 6 ). IPA is a constituent of bacterial tRNA (39), and very low titers of IPA (4 to 12 mg/liter) have been observed in cultures of a small number of bacterial plant symbiotes (44, 45) . Interestingly, P. nigrescens produces more than 500 mg/liter of IPA. Free IPA is best known as a plant cytokinin (46) and has been reported to inhibit enterovirus 71 (EV-71) infection in cell culture (47) ; however, to the best of our knowledge, neither the production of IPA by human commensal bacteria nor its activity toward SARS-CoV-2 was known.\n",
            " Tryptamine is a known bacterial agonist of the 5-HTR family of GPCRs. In a smallscale randomized clinical trial, fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is typically used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, was associated with improved COVID-19 outcomes (9). In addition, in a retrospective study of patients taking antipsychotic and antidepressant serotonin 2A receptor antagonists (e.g., trazadone, mirtazapine), taking these drugs was associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 infections (48) . While the mechanisms that explain these observations remain to be determined, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity observed for modulators of 5- HTR signaling suggests that it will be interesting to explore the potential antiviral effects of modulating this signaling pathway through engineering of the microbiome.\n",
            " BIP is a pyrazine-based antiviral produced only by M. luteus among the strains we examined. Small pyrazines like 2,5-dimethylpyrazine have been reported to have antifungal activity, while the larger, indole-containing BIP has been reported to be inactive as an antimicrobial (40, 49) . The biosynthesis of small pyrazines is relatively common in nature (50) , and opportunistic human pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and Serratia marcescens have been reported to produce small pyrazines as potential signaling molecules (51, 52) . Indole-bearing pyrazines have only been observed a few times in nature (40) . In one case, both BIP and IMP were reported as products of a Brevibacillus laterosporus strain that was cultured from the ear of a feral hog (41) . The identification of BIP and IMP from M. luteus, a commonly observed human skin commensal, is, to our knowledge, both the first example of indole-containing pyrazines being produced by a human microbiome-derived bacterium and the first report of BIP having antiviral activity. As these metabolites have not been previously reported from the human microbiome, we do not know if they ever accumulate at significant quantities physiologically.\n",
            " Any potential ecological role of these metabolites in a complex host, microbiome, and virus tripartite interaction remains to be determined. However, the similarity between commensal antiviral metabolites and FDA-approved antivirals is intriguing and unexpected. Our identification of metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity suggests that the human microbiota may encode a reservoir of small molecules with antiviral activity and that continued screening of commensal bacterial extracts should be a fruitful strategy for identifying additional antiviral small molecules.\n",
            " Chemicals, cell lines, and viral strains. IPA and tryptamine standards were obtained from Cayman Chemical and Alfa Aesar, respectively. All bacterial strains were obtained from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH, as part of the Human Microbiome Project (13) . Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells (Homo sapiens; sex, male; liver epithelial) (53) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Cells have been authenticated and tested negative for contamination with mycoplasma. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020; BEI Resources) and HCoV-229E were amplified and titrated by standard plaque assay (PA) in Huh-7.5 cells (54) . The generation of viral stocks for additional viruses has been previously described as follows: hPIV-3 (55) (based on strain JS) and YFV 17D Venus (56) (derived from YF17D-59C25Venus2AUbi).\n",
            " Bacterial fermentations. All bacteria were cultivated in LBM media (17 g/liter brain heart infusion, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 200 mg MgSO 4 Á7H 2 O, 100 mg/liter MnCl 2 Á4H 2 O, 5 mg/liter hemin, 1 g/liter maltose, 1 g/liter cellobiose, and 0.5 g/liter L-cysteine). Bacterial fermentations were performed aerobically or anaerobically for each individual strain. For aerobic fermentations, the bacterial glycerol stock provided by BEI was used to inoculate 10 ml of LBM. This culture was grown for 24 to 48 h at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm, and once, turbid was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh LBM media in a 3-liter baffled Fernbach flask. The culture was fermented for 7 days at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm, followed by metabolite extraction as described below. All anaerobic fermentations were performed in a 37°C incubator placed inside vinyl anaerobic chamber (Coy) with a gas mix of 5% CO 2 , 5% H 2 , and 90% N 2 . The bacterial glycerol stock provided by BEI was used to inoculate 10 ml of LBM. This culture was grown for 24 to 48 h, and once, turbid was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh LBM media in a 1-liter glass bottle (Chemglass). Fermentation proceeded anaerobically for 7 days at 37°C followed by metabolite extraction as described below.\n",
            " Small molecule extraction and prefractionation. Amberlite XAD7HP resin (Sigma) was activated by soaking in methanol for 15 min, followed by washing five times with deionized water. Resin was stored in water until needed. Twenty grams of activated Amberlite resin was added to 1 liter of a cell suspension of bacterial culture and incubated with shaking (200 rpm) at room temperature for 4 h. Resin was then collected by filtration. We added 300 ml of acetone (Sigma), and this mixture was shaken for 2 h at room temperature. The acetone elution was collected, and an equal volume of fresh acetone was added and allowed to incubate with the resin overnight at room temperature. This second acetone elution was combined with the first and dried in vacuo on a rotary evaporator (Buchi) to afford a crude metabolite extract.\n",
            " Each extract was resuspended in methanol (Sigma) to a concentration of 100 mg/ml. One milliliter (100 mg) of this solution was aliquoted and diluted in water to 5% methanol and spun down to prepare for fractionation on a Strata C 18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge (500 mg, 3 ml; Phenomenex). The SPE cartridge was activated with two column volumes of methanol followed by washing with two column volumes of water. The crude extract was then passed over the column, and the flowthrough (fraction F1) was collected. Metabolites were then eluted (two column volumes) using a stepwise gradient of increasing methanol concentrations as follows: F2, 30%; F3, 70%; and F4, 100%. These elutions, along with the column flowthrough, were dried in vacuo, affording four prefractionated extracts from each crude metabolite pool.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. The day prior to infection, Huh-7.5 cells were seeded at 7.5 Â 10 3 cells/ well into 96-well plates. The next day, serially diluted compounds were added to the wells, followed 1 h later by infections with either SARS-CoV-2 (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 0.05 PFU/cell), HCoV-229E (MOI, 0.05 PFU/cell), YFV 17D Venus (MOI, 0.025 PFU/cell), or hPIV-3-GFP (MOI, 0.05 IU/cell). Cells were incubated for 48 h at 33°C for infections performed with SARS-CoV-2 and at 37°C for infections performed with other viruses. Cells were then fixed by adding an equal volume of 7% formaldehyde to the wells and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After extensive washing, SARS-CoV-2-and HCoV-229E-infected cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution of 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (catalog no. 005-000-121; Jackson ImmunoResearch). A rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (catalog no. GTX135357; GeneTex) was added to the cells at 1:1,000 dilution in blocking solution and incubated at 4°C overnight. J2, a mouse monoclonal anti-double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) antibody (catalog no. 10010500; Scicons) was added to the cells under similar conditions to detect HCoV-229E-infected cells. Goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (catalog no. A-11012; Life Technologies) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (catalog no. A-11001; Life Technologies) were used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:2,000. Nuclei for all infections, including those with the fluorescently labeled YFV 17D and hPIV-3, were stained with Hoechst 33342 (catalog no. 62249; Thermo Scientific) at 1 mg/ml. Next, images were acquired with an ImageXpress XLS Widefield High-Content microscope (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Images were acquired using the DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) filter (excitation, 377 nm, and emission, 447 nm) for Hoechst staining and the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter (excitation, 482 nm, and emission, 536 nm) for viral nucleocapsid staining. Images were analyzed using an automated custom module in the MetaXpress software (Molecular Devices). Default software analysis scripts were used for DAPI-and FITC-positive cell counting. Infection was calculated as the percentage of viable cells that were positive for viral nucleocapsid. For determining the efficacy of isolated metabolites, 10-point doseresponse curves in a 1:3 dilution series were tested in triplicate using a maximum concentration of 50 mM (IPA) or 250 mM (tryptamine, BIP, and IMP). IC 50 values were calculated using a variable-slope, four-parameter nonlinear regression curve fit (GraphPad Prism 8). All SARS-CoV-2 experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.\n",

Each well of a 6-well plate was seeded (3.0 Â 10 6 cells), and cells were allowed to attach overnight. The medium was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of fresh DMEM containing either IPA or remdesivir at 10 mM. After 3 h, cells were harvested. The medium was removed, and plates were immediately placed on ice. Ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) was used to wash each well twice, and then, 500 ml extraction solution (80% CH 3 OH/ H 2 O, 5% formic acid, and 10 mM oligomycin standard, prechilled at 280°C for .1 h) was added to each well. Cells were allowed to lyse for 15 min on ice. Each well was then scraped with a sterile cell scraper, and the lysate was transferred to an Eppendorf tube. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 Â g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred into preweighed 4-ml glass vials and dried in vacuo without heat (CentriVap; Labconco). Dried material was resuspended in 200 ml 50:25:25 H 2 O/CH 3 CN/CH 3 OH and centrifuged at 16,000 Â g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were moved into 96-well polypropylene plates, covered with slit silicone mats, and stored at 220°C until analysis by HR-MS.\n",
            " Chemical synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates. Trimethyl phosphate (0.5 ml, stored over 4-Å molecular sieves) (0.5 ml) was added to IPA (0.05 mmol) over 4-Å molecular sieves. The mixture was stirred for 24 h under an argon atmosphere. Phosphorus oxychloride (0.0070 ml, 0.075 mmol) was added via syringe, and the mixture was stirred for 3 h at 0°C. A mixture of tributylamine (0.060 ml, 0.25 mmol) and tributylammonium pyrophosphate (0.25 mmol, 90.8 mg) dissolved in acetonitrile (0.25 ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min at 0°C. The reaction was quenched by addition of triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) (1 M) (0.5 ml) and water (5 ml). The reaction mixture was purified by HPLC using the conditions described above with the following solvent gradient: 0 to 4 min, 5% B; 4 to 30 min, increase to 60% B; 35 to 40 min, increase to 95% B; and 40 to 50 min, 9% B. The identity of the IPA 59-triphosphate was confirmed by HR-MS.\n",

RNA primer (59-CGCGUAGCAUGCUACGUCAUUCUCC UAAGAAGCUA-39) was labeled at the 59 end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [g 32 -P]ATP (PerkinElmer). The labeling reaction was heat inactivated at 70°C for 20 min, and unincorporated [g 32 -P] ATP was removed with a 7 molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) Zeba spin column (Thermo Fisher). The labeled RNA primer was then annealed to the template strand (59-CUAUCCCCAUGUGA UUUUAAUAGCUUCUUAGGAGAAUGACGUAGCAUGCUACGCG-39; Horizon Discovery) by heating to 95°C for 2 min and cooling to 10°C for 30 min. Proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex were purified as previously reported (27, 57) . Nsp12 was incubated with 2.5-fold molar excess of Nsp7 and Nsp8 at room temperature for 15 min and buffer exchanged into transcription buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mM K-acetate, 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) through a 7 MWCO Zeba Spin desalting column (Thermo Fisher). The holo-complex (1.25 mM) was incubated with the RNA scaffold (1 mM) at 37°C for 15 min before the addition of NTPs and inhibitors (50 mM) 39-deoxyadenosine-59-triphosphate (TriLink), remdesivir triphosphate (Gilead Sciences), and isopentenyl ATP in 10-ml reactions. In vitro transcription reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 10 min before being quenched with an equal volume of 2Â stop buffer (95% [vol/vol] formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue, and xylene cyanol). Elongation products were separated on 15% acrylamide-6 M urea denaturing gel alongside Decade RNA ladder (Thermo Fisher) in 1Â Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) and analyzed by phosphorimaging.\n",

            "Title: The Importance of Glycans of Viral and Host Proteins in Enveloped Virus Infection\n",
            "Body Text: Animal viruses are parasites of animal cells that have characteristics such as heredity and replication, and are mainly composed of DNA or RNA, proteins and in some, a lipid membrane with glycoproteins (1) . Commonly, viruses achieve invasion and infection with the help of the synthetic machinery of host cells. Viruses can be divided into two groups depending on whether they have a lipid bilayer membrane on their outer surface or not: enveloped viruses and nonenveloped viruses. Enveloped viruses have a lipid bilayer that comes from the host cell. It incorporates receptor attachment proteins and membrane fusion proteins that are both encoded by the virus. And all attachment or fusion proteins of enveloped viruses are modified by glycosylation. Glycosylation is important for the life cycle of the virus and plays essential roles in stability, antigenicity and infectivity of viruses (2) . We summarize the functions of common enveloped viral glycoproteins in Table 1 .\n",
            " Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications of proteins, and there are two main types: N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation ( Figure 1 ). N-glycosylation means that Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in an oligosaccharide binds covalently to the polypeptide chain by an Nglycoside linkage with the amide nitrogen of an asparagine residue in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X is any amino acid other than proline). The main type of O-glycosylation is the mucin-type O-glycosylation, which means that N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) bonds covalently to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residues replacing the hydrogen in the hydroxyl group to form an (12) . The formation and extension of glycans requires the synergistic completion of two types of glycan processing enzymes, one is glycosyltransferase which catalyzes the formation of glycoside linkages, and another is glycosidase which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycoside linkages (13) .\n",
            " The entry of a virus into a host cell is closely related to the glycans on its own structural proteins. The glycoproteins of some viruses play an important role in host infection, especially in the recognition of the host cell and the interaction with other molecules in the cell after the attachment (14) . Furthermore, due to the fact that viruses can fully depend on cellular host cells These viral glycoprotein are classified as: (1) GP, glycoprotein; (2) HA, hemagglutinin; (3) E, enveloped proteins; (4) prM, premembrane; (5) S, spike protein.\n",
            " FIGURE 1 | Glycoconjugates that formed by carbohydrates are covalently bonded to proteins and lipids on mammalian cell membranes. Proteins can be glycosylated and covalently bound to a polypeptide chain via an N-glycoside linkage to Asn or via an O-glycoside linkage to Ser/Thr. N-linked glycans share a common pentasaccharide core structure, which is composed of two GlcNAc and three mannoses. The main type of O-linked glycosylation is the mucin-type Oglycosylation, which has N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) as a common core. Glycosphingolipids are ubiquitous molecules that formed via the covalent linkage between a glycan moiety and a ceramide.\n",
            " for their reproduction, thus, they must complete glycosylation with the help of host glycoprotein synthesis mechanism (1, 15) . Viral glycoproteins are involved in many important biological processes, such as protein folding and stabilization, viral infection and invasion, recognition of host receptors and immune escape of the virus from the immune system (16) .\n",
            " With the development of glycan-related research technology, the research and development of novel virus vaccines and antiviral drugs modified by glycosylation are receiving increasing attention. In this review, we will explore the effects of glycosylation of host and virus proteins on virus biological behavior, with the aim of providing a reference for the prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases.\n",
            " The life cycle of enveloped viruses includes the processes of adsorption, penetration, uncoating, biosynthesis, assembly and release. Figure 2 summarizes the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.\n",
            " Viral replication depends on successful infection of the host cells. The replication cycle starts with a virus particle attaching to a specific receptor on the surface of a host cell, and viral entry can be realized by endocytosis (non-enveloped or enveloped viruses), membrane fusion (enveloped viruses) or direct fusion with the plasma membrane (20, 21) . After internalization, the capsid is released into the cytoplasm with negative strand viruses, it is uncoating the nucleocapsid, which will be copied to produce the antigenome which itself is then used to transcribe many copies of the genome, or mRNA that are translated into viral proteins (17, 18) . The viral glycopeptides are translated on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where the N-linked glycans are added and transported through the Golgi complex where the N-linked glycans are modified and the O-glycans are added (22, 23) . At the same time, the viral genome with its associated proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus, where they are released outside the cell by exocytosis after maturation (24) . Glycoproteins are essential for the infectivity of the virions that have them.\n",
            " The glycoproteins in the membrane of enveloped viruses bind specifically to the receptors on the cell membrane and cause membrane fusion enabling virus contents to enter the cell. In this process, the surface glycans of the virus can be involved in initiating the recognition of host cells and thus affect the organs and the cells that in the organs. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is an enveloped virus, and its envelope contains of gp120 surface protein and gp41 transmembrane protein. Moreover, gp120 is one of the most highly glycosylated proteins in nature. It accounts for approximately 50% of the total mass (25) . These glycans not only affect the conformation of the envelope but also affect the entry and infectivity of the virus. It is generally believed that HIV-1 gp120 promotes viral entry by sequentially binding to CD4 and chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 on target cells (26) . However, there have been many reports that gp120 can bind to various cell types independently of CD4. Some HIV-1 isolates were able to infect CD4-negative but CCR5 expressing cells due to the deficiency of Asn 197 in gp120, which leads to the exposure of the CCR5-binding region of gp120, thus HIV-1 can enter cells (27) . Similarly, the binding of virus to CD4 was reduced significantly by removing the glycan chains from gp120 by endoglycosidase treatment or Nglycosylation site mutation (28, 29) . In contrast, in Vero cells, removing the N-glycan near the highly conserved receptor binding domain on the envelope glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus (EBOV) increased GP-mediated virus entry efficiency (30) . Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the surface glycoproteins of influenza A virus. Influenza virus attaches to the surface of a host cell when its HA protein interacts with the terminal sialic acid (SA) of the host cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids. On the other hand, NA can cleave SA residues from glycoproteins of the enveloped virus itself and enhance infectivity by preventing aggregation of virus particles (31) . NA may also act on the SA residues of host mucin to gain access to the epithelial cells, playing a secondary role in helping viruses to enter host cells (32) .\n",
            " One of the key roles of protein glycosylation is its effect on folding, structure, transport, and stability (33) . Glycans can be structurally integrated into protein folding, and the interaction between the glycan and protein could stabilize the protein. Besides, glycans can also assist glycoprotein folding in the biosynthetic process by mediating interactions with chaperones (34) . Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) act as chaperones to facilitate the correct folding of viral proteins. In cells, when all nascent N-glycans added to a protein, they have three terminal glucose residues. These residues will be removed sequentially, with a -glucosidase I (aGI) removing the outermost glucose residue and a-glucosidase II (aGII) removing the next two residues produce the immature GlcMan9GlcNAc2 N-glycans (35) . CNX and CRT have a lectin domain, and this domain can specifically bind to immature GlcMan 9 GlcNAc 2 N-glycans on misfolded proteins and recruit ATP, calcium, and protein disulfide isomerase A3 to promote the folding of glycoproteins, thereby regulating glycoprotein entry into the CNX/CRT folding cycle (36, 37) .\n",
            " Glycans on enveloped virus surface proteins can not only facilitate the folding of proteins but can also affect their transport. During HIV-1 replication, a high mannose type gp160 trimer assembles in the rough ER of host cells, and then gp160 is transported to the Golgi apparatus and cleaved by a furinlike protease in the late Golgi to its mature gp120 and gp41 proteins which remain associated (38, 39) . HIV-1 gp41 contains four N-glycosylation sites, removing of Asn 332 in gp41 can disrupt the proteolytic processing and the transportation of gpl60 (40, 41) . Herpes simplex viruses 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex viruses 2 (HSV-2) are globally prevalent pathogens, which often lead to recurrent oral and genital ulcers (42) . HSV encodes at least 12 different glycoproteins, and at least four of them are necessary and sufficient to mediate membrane fusion when they infect target cells, namely glycoprotein B (gB), gD, gH and gL (43) (44) (45) . Similarly, mutations of N390, N483 or N668 in total seven potential N-glycosylation sites on gB of HSV-2 can reduce the ability of cell-cell fusion and virus entry. However, the mutation of N133 mainly prevents the transport of gB from the ER to the Golgi, thus affecting protein expression and the production of infectious virions (46) .\n",
            " Enveloped viruses mainly release their progeny by budding. Their envelope is derived from the host cell membrane, and the glycan on viral proteins can affect the release of progeny virions. For example, gC of HSV-1 mediates the attachment of HSV-1 to susceptible host cells by interacting with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) on the cell surface. Also, gC contains a mucin-like domain (MLD) located near the GAG binding site, which may affect the binding activity between the virus and GAG. HSV-1 mutants that lack these MLDs in gC and found that compared with natural HSV-1, the binding affinity of virions to the cell was reduced and the release ability of mutant virus particles from the surface of infected cells was also reduced (47) . Similarly, glycosylation sites on the premembrane protein and enveloped proteins of West Nile virus (WNV) are cell typedependent or even species-dependent and affect the release of virus and infection efficiency (10) .\n",
            " Moreover, some viruses have even evolved glycosidases to promote virus release (48) . The most obvious example is that influenza virus NA cleaves SA residues from the surface of host cells, thereby reducing and weakening the ability of HA to bind to host cell glycoprotein receptors (49, 50) . During the process of virus budding from the cell plasma membrane, HA proteins continue to bind virions to SA residues on the cell surface until the NA sialidase activity removes terminal SA residues.\n",
            " During the process of viral evolution, viruses develop different glycosylation modifications, and N-glycosylation sites of proteins are added or deleted, these alterations can have an appreciable impact on the survival and transmissibility of a virus (16) . For example, adding an N-glycosylation site to the HA protein can increase the sensitivity of the respiratory system to innate immune protein production, and reduce the transmissibility of influenza A viruses (51) (52) (53) . Similarly, N-glycan of HIV gp120 is also of vital importance to viral infection and transmission (54) . The majority of HIV N-glycan deficient mutants show decreased infectivity and transmission efficiency (N156Q, N197Q, N332Q, N386Q), but two of the N-glycan mutants (N230Q and N295Q) show increased infectivity and transmission efficiency (54) . SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing a health crisis, the magnitude of which is rare in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 virus spike (S) glycoprotein is highly glycosylated, if the glycosylation sites of both N331 and N343 are mutated at the same time, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 can be significantly reduced, suggesting that their glycans are important for viral infectivity (55) .\n",
            " In addition, replication of the same virus in different cells can generate different glycosylation, which severely affects the transmission ability of the virus (56) . For example, HIV from different cell lines has different glycosylation in its envelope proteins, and the glycosylation difference affects its interaction with Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). HIV from T cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells was well bound and transmitted by DC-SIGN, whereas HIV from macrophages was poorly bound and transmitted (57, 58) .\n",
            " Enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1, influenza virus, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 are a great threat to humans. The envelope proteins of these viruses are heavily glycosylated, and these glycans can hide an antigenic epitope to thereby avoiding recognition by neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against that site and providing a convenient way for viruses to infect host cells and to promote immune escape. There are two main mechanisms by which viruses can escape the nAbs response.\n",
            " Despite major efforts to produce a vaccine for HIV-1, it is unfortunate that all of the traditional methods of vaccine preparation have generated little expected effect due to the great diversity of HIV-1 strains (59) . Only a minority of people produce nAbs after receiving HIV vaccines. Mutation of Asn 332 in gp120 after HIV infection and also nAbs that target this site were detected in the sera from two people who had responded to an HIV vaccine (a recombinant glycoprotein 120 vaccine), suggesting that HIV antigenic sites are blocked by glycans, resulting in most people failing to produce broadly nAbs (60) . Similarly, patients with acute HIV infection do not produce detectable nAbs until at least 52 days after infection. Hardly any mutations were detected in the envelope proteins of the viruses that successfully escaped after nAbs suppression, while an increase in N-glycosylation was detected (61) . Moreover, one of the two N-glycosylation sites of Ebola virus GP2 is mutated, which is very adverse to the antigenicity and immunogenicity of GP (62) . All of these observations illustrate that highly glycosylated modifications can shield the antigenic sites of the virus and present challenges to antiviral therapy.\n",
            " Antigenic drift is a small variation in antigens caused by mutations in the genome, without new subtypes generation, but it often promotes immune escape and leads to the greater scope of the spreading, which often occurs in influenza viruses. H1N1 broke out in 1918/1919, infecting nearly half of the world's population, with a mortality rate of 2.5%~5%, at least 50 million people died (63) . Ninety-one years later, in April 2009, the new H1N1 virus appeared and spread rapidly around the world, causing an estimated 280,000 deaths worldwide. Low immunity of the population to the novel H1N1 strain was the main reason that led to its mass epidemic. HA is an effective target for nAbs, and mutations in the antigenic sites in its globular head region promote the immune escape of the virus. A complete analysis of the amino acid sequence of the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses showed that the HA of these viruses can be glycosylated at the conserved glycosylation sites (64, 65) . It was reported that highly glycosylated seasonal Influenza A viruses are inactivated by soluble lectins of the innate immune system (66) . Compared with seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses, the HA globular regions of epidemic H1N1 are often modified by a low degree of glycosylation, which correlates with a greater difference at the amino acid level seen at or near the known antigenic sites located in the globular head of the HA (67, 68) . Furthermore, that only influenza (H1N1) shows antigenic drift compared to several other RNA viruses that infect the respiratory tract (69) . These antigenic drifts contribute to the immune escape of H1N1, contributing in part to the flu vaccine failing to provide protection (70) .\n",
            " There are many glycans in virus surface glycoproteins, and they affect the virulence of the virus by regulating the binding of the virus to host receptors, covering up antigenic sites, or stimulating host immune responses to affect virulence (71) . These glycans play different roles in the virulence of the virus.\n",
            " Rabies viruses (RABVs) are non-segmented, negativestranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae. The RABV genome encodes five structural proteins: nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, GP, and large transcriptase protein (9) . GP is the only viral transmembrane protein that is exposed on the virion surface that interacts and the target cell receptor. The GP of most RABVs has two N-glycosylation sites, Asn 37 and Asn 319 . The N-glycan at Asn 37 plays a role in promoting the propagation of the virus but also reduces the pathogenicity of the virus (53) . Similarly, the addition of a single N-glycan at Asn 194 or Asn 247 also reduced the pathogenicity of street rabies viruses, confirmed by peripheral infection in mice (72) . Furthermore, the virulence of H1N1 for mice decreased with an increase in the number of HA glycosylation sites (64) .\n",
            " On the other hand, the glycans of viral proteins can also enhance their virulence. For example, glycosylated and nonglycosylated E proteins of WNV are neurovirulent. However, viruses containing glycosylated E proteins are more neuroinvasive in BALB/c mice (73) . Otherwise, the adding N-glycosylation of amino acids at either 154 or 156 increase neuro-invasiveness in mice, avian virulence, and vector competence (74) .\n",
            " The specific binding of a virus to host receptor is a prerequisite for viral infection, and the viral glycans responsible for attachment and cell receptors of viruses play a decisive role. Many studies have focused on the functions of glycans on the viral protein: such as host cell recognition, replication, infection and immune escape. However, hosts and viruses have coevolutionary relationships, thus the functions of host receptors are also crucial, and all viruses must interact with the specific receptors when they enter a cell. The specificity of host receptors is considered to be one of the major factors in determining host range and tissue tropism. Host receptor refers to a component of the host cell membrane that can bind specifically to the virus, mediate virus entry, and promote virus infection. Its chemical nature is a glycoprotein, proteoglycan, lipid, or glycolipid (75, 76) . According to their different functions, virus receptors can be divided into two categories: attachment factors and entry receptors (77) . Entry receptors can bind to the virus and mediate the internalization of the virus, for example, HIV can bind to CD4. Attachment factors concentrate viruses on the cell surface and play an auxiliary role in the process of virus infection (78) . For example, heparin sulfate, which is proteoglycan widely found on various cell surfaces and extracellular matrix in the body, can act as an auxiliary receptor of SARS-CoV-2 to promote the entry of virus (79) . Therefore, glycans on a host cell receptor can play an important role in influencing viral infection as a functional receptor or attachment factor for the virus.\n",
            " SA is a naturally existing nine-carbon monosaccharide and has been identified as a functional receptor attached to the termini of N-glycans or O-glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids (80) . SA is one of the first sites for the contact between many pathogens and hosts because it presents on the outer surface of cells and mucosal tissues. SA carried by most mammals is called Nglycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) ( Figure 3A) ; however, our ancestors also evolved another kind of SA, called Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), probably to resist the malaria parasite that was able to use Neu5Gc to enter the human body at that time. After completing this evolution, making some diseases seem more particularly specific to humans, such as typhoid, cholera, mumps, pertussis, asthma, and coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) (81) . When SARS-CoV-2 enters the human body, it recognizes SA first, and search for its receptor at the same time, then it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), opening the access into the cell (82, 83) .\n",
            " Usually, SA exists as a bound sugar at the terminal positions of glycans via different glycosidic linkages (a2,3, a2,6, and a2,8) . Figure 3B shows common SA linkage types. SA can be found in almost all animals, but the virus cannot infect all animals that have SA. Besides, different viruses infect different hosts by employing different receptors, which may be determined by the diversification of SA residue linkage types ( Figure 3B) , that is, viruses have a specific selectivity in the process of infecting the host. For example, the influenza virus binds to the receptor by recognizing SA residue at the terminal position of the receptor glycoprotein glycan chain, but it has the preference for certain types of SA (such as Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac). The preferential binding property may be attributed to the changes in the penultimate galactose residue linkage to SA. Avian influenza virus mainly binds to a2,3-linked SA residue, while human influenza virus preferentially binds to a2,6-linked SA residue (84, 85) .\n",
            " Other glycans can also act as viral receptors to influence the entry of viruses, such as heparan sulfate, which can act as an initial adhesion receptors for various viruses, so it can help the virus adhere to the cells and mediate entry before the virus binds to the high-affinity receptors. HSV entry begins with the attachment of the virus to target cells through binding of HSV gC and/or gB to heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 or syndecan-2 of the epithelial cell surface. Then, via various cell surface receptors such as nectin-1 or nectin-2. Finally, the attached virus begins to enter the cells (86) (87) (88) . Like HSV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters cells by interacting with syndecan-1 or syndecan-4 on the surface of human hepatocytes to initiate its life cycle (89, 90) . As for HCV, its functional receptors include SRB1, CD81, CLDN1, and OCLN, among which CD81 is the most important (91) .\n",
            " Also, neutral glycans may act as virus receptors, such as histo-blood group antigens, which are present in red blood cells, epithelial cells, and mucosal secretions, and play an important role as attachment factors for Rotavirus and Norovirus (92, 93) .\n",
            " Faced with the threat of new viruses, the effective prevention measure that we can take is to control the source of infection, cut off the main route of transmission and protect the susceptible population, these measures will be essential to bring the situation under control and to alleviate the negative effects of the epidemic. The definitive solution is effective vaccines that induce uninfected people to generate protective antibody and build long-term immune memory to combat the virus if the vaccine ever comes in contact with that virus at a later time.\n",
            " Although we know that the envelope proteins in HIV are the only target for nAbs (94) , it is unfortunate that almost all of the traditional methods of vaccine preparation have generated little expected effect due to the great diversity of HIV-1 strains. Removal of the N-glycan modifications in the highly variable V1-V3 region of HIV-1 envelope protein improves the sensitivity of the virus to nAbs (95) . Similarly, the gp120 complex mutated at the glycosylation site N448E can activate antiviral immunity better than the gp120 wild type. This suggests that removing N-glycans can increase the effectiveness of HIV vaccine (3). However, the heterogeneity of the HIV envelope, viruses tend to escape from most neutralizing antibody responses. Currently, HIV vaccine development research is focused on inducing unique broadly nAbs to act on diverse strains of HIV-1.\n",
            " Because of the antigenic drift of influenza viruses, current influenza vaccines need to be updated annually. The number and length of glycans on HA can affect the immune response; reducing the length of glycans can induce nAbs to make a stronger immune response to antigenic epitopes (96) . The binding of nAbs to the HA glycans was inhibited at low temperature because the low temperature can stiffen the glycan structure (97) . Interestingly, increased density of viral glycans in oligosaccharide-modified influenza viruses can directly activate the immune response and there exists a class of conserved epitopes in influenza viruses, that after adding hyperglycosylated artificially will become dominant (It was verified by mice in vivo experiment) (98) . This finding suggests that further study on glycosylation of influenza virus HA protein can be helpful to develop antiviral drugs.\n",
            " Experimental vaccines against HSV-1 target particular viral glycoproteins. HSV envelope gD is expressed on the surface of the virus and induces a nAbs response. The largest current clinical trial of HSV subunit vaccines has found an inhibitory effect on HSV-1, but no effect against HSV-2 (99). A different attenuated vaccine strategy has been attempted by using HSV without glycoprotein D2, this vaccine can induce neutralizing antibody which displays antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity to achieve better protection from HSV infection (100, 101) .\n",
            " The GP of EBOV is the main target of nAbs. Most of the current research on Ebola vaccines uses GP as the immunogen. Mature GP is composed of GP1 and GP2. They are presented on the surface of virions as trimers of disulfide-linked GP1-GP2 heterodimers. The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap, and the MLD. The MLD is highly variable and contains both N-and O-linked glycans (30) . The MLD is essential for immune shielding, studies have shown that the MLD-deleted GP1 and GP2 can induce an immune response that may result in cross-species immunity (102) . Similarly, a subunit vaccine that contains the extracellular domain of the GP fused with the Fc fragment of human IgG1 to protect mice against EBOV lethal challenge (103). Further research found that mutation of Asn 565 on GP2 was highly detrimental to the immunogenicity of GP; However, mutation of two N-glycosylation sites on GP1 (388, 415 sites) may enhance immunogenicity (62) . Hence, the glycan on EBOV GP play an important role in inducing immunity, and further study of glycan may help us develop more effective vaccines.\n",
            " The S protein is the only antigen that is target of nAbs. The RNA vaccine that expecting S protein now aims to use all over the world. The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly glycosylated with 22 N-glycosylation sites (104) . However, in the face of mutant virus strains, existing vaccines are less effective (105, 106) . Deletion of the N331 and N343 glycosylation sites of SARS-CoV-2 S protein could significantly reduce the ability of the virus to infect, and mutations of N234Q and N165Q could markedly resist to nAbs and be more sensitive, respectively (55) . The functional study of different glycosylation sites on S protein may provide references for the development of effective vaccines and drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in the future.\n",
            " Glycans can affect the host cell recognition, replication, infection and immune escape of virus. With the deepening understanding of the structure and function of enveloped virus glycoproteins, research and development of antibody drugs that target enveloped virus glycoproteins have become a current hot topic (94) . Studies have shown that lectins can inhibit HIV-1 infection by binding directly to the viral glycans, thereby disrupting the receptor-induced conformational changes, inhibiting membrane fusion, and blocking the binding of DC-SIGN (107) (108) (109) . In addition, tetherin is a protein molecule on the surface of human cells that can block the spread of HIV and inhibit the release of a broad-spectrum of enveloped viruses by retaining virions on the surface of the infected cell. It has been reported that the antiviral activity of tetherin is related to its glycosylation. Human tetherin contains two putative N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn 65 and Asn 92 ), and glycosylation of at least one Asn of tetherin is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of HIV-1 release (110) . The use of mannosidase-I inhibitor such as kifunensine inhibits the biosynthesis of Nglycan and enhances proteolysis of S proteins, which reduces receptor-binding domain presentation on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, lowers the binding to host ACE2 and decrease viral entry (111) . In addition, other N-glycosylation inhibitors, like swainsonine, which is mannosidase II inhibitor and has been shown to be safe in humans, can cause N-glycan truncation may be used to reduce viral entry (112) . Iminosugars are known inhibitors of aGI and aGII, like celgosivir, castanospermine, and UV-4, which can effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture (113) . These drugs and compounds may be used to reduce viral load and moderate SARS-CoV-2 related respiratory symptoms.\n",
            " Other potential inhibitors that may modulate viral entry include carbohydrate-based small molecules (e.g. 4F-GlcNAC, 4F-GalNAC) and acceptor decoys (e.g. ONAP, SNAP) are used by interfering with the mutual recognition process of glycan and lectin (114) .\n",
            " Historically, viral diseases have repeatedly caused large-scale global public health concerns and threats to human health and survival. Figure 4 illustrates the transmission pathway of several common viruses that infect humans. Increasing evidence shows that the alterations in the N-glycan profile and sugar recognition pattern in host cells can reflect the progress of viral infection to some extent and are expected to be a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of viral infection (116) . In short, glycosylation can be a tool for the virus to infect the host and escape host immunity. Here, we have summarized the progress in studying the effects of glycan on viral behavior in recent decades, which will provide new insights for the development of viral vaccines and help to develop new targets to protect against these viruses. Finally, faced with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we need to identify the key therapeutic targets including glycosylation sites in vaccines and drug targets. With the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, although we have effective countermeasures, the mutated version of the virus still threatens the health safety of mankind. In general, the existing vaccines are still effective against the mutated virus, but the neutralization efficiency is lower (106) . How to develop a more effective vaccine has become an urgent task at present. As one of the most important post-translational modifications, glycosylation is an indispensable factor in virus function. Glycosylation inhibitors can significantly inhibit viral infection and reduce the synthesis of viral proteins (117) . We need to design a new vaccine virus by researching the glycosylation sites that have an impact on the viability of the virus, and modifying the glycosylation of the virus (118) . Similarly, it is also very important to study SARS-CoV-2 S glycans differ from typical host glycan processing and develop targeted glycosylation inhibitors. In addition, the use of this inhibitor in combination with other types of antiviral drugs may have a better effect in combating viral infection, replication and overcoming viral resistance (119).\n",

            "Body Text: Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Many infectious diseases are also contagious, which means the infection can be transmitted from one person to another when there is some interaction (e.g., physical proximity) between them. Today, we live in an interconnected world where such contagious diseases could spread through social contact networks to become global public health hazards. A recent example of this phenomenon is the Covid-19 outbreak caused by the so-called novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has spread to many countries Zhu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020) . This recent global outbreak has caused serious social and economic repercussions, such as massive restrictions on movement and share market decline (Chinazzi et al., 2020) . It is therefore of great practical relevance to investigate the transmission of contagious diseases through social contact networks from the perspective of statistical inference.\n",
            " Consider an infection being transmitted through a population of n individuals. According to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model of disease spread, the pathogen can be transmitted from an infected person (I) to a susceptible person (S) with an infection rate given by β, and an infected individual becomes recovered (R) with a recovery rate given by µ. This can be modeled as a Markov chain whose state at time t is given by a vector (X t 1 , . . . , X t n ), where X t i denotes the state of the i th individual at time t, i.e., X t i ∈ {S, I, R}. For the population of n individuals, the state space of this Markov chain becomes extremely large with 3 n possible configurations, which makes it impractical to study the exact system. This problem was addressed in a series of three seminal papers by Kermack and McKendrick (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927 , 1932 , 1933 . Instead of modeling the disease state of each individual at at a given point of time, they proposed compartmental models, where the goal is to model the number of individuals in a particular disease state (e.g., susceptible, infected, recovered) at a given point of time. Since their classical papers, there has been a tremendous amount of work on compartmental modeling of contagious diseases over the last ninety years (Hethcote, 2000; Van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002; Brauer et al., 2012) .\n",
            " Compartmental models make the unrealistic assumption of homogeneity, i.e., each individual is assumed to have the same probability of interacting with any other individual. In reality, individuals interact with each other in a highly heterogeneous manner, depending upon various factors such as age, cultural norms, lifestyle, weather, etc. The contagion process can be significantly impacted by heterogeneity of interactions Rocha et al., 2011; Galvani and May, 2005; Woolhouse et al., 1997) , and therefore compartmental modeling of contagious diseases can lead to substantial errors.\n",
            " In recent years, contact networks have emerged as a preferred alternative to compartmental models (Keeling, 2005) . Here, a node represents an individual, and an edge between two nodes represent social contact between them. An edge connecting an infected node and a susceptible node represents a potential path for pathogen transmission. This framework can realistically represent the heterogeneous nature of social contacts, and therefore provide much more accurate modeling of the contagion process than compartmental models. Notable examples where the use of contact networks have led to improvements in prediction or understanding of infectious diseases include Bengtsson et al. (2015) and Kramer et al. (2016) .\n",
            " Consider the scenario where a pathogen is introduced into a social contact network and it spreads according to an SIR model. It is of particular interest to know whether the pathogen will die out or lead to an epidemic. This is dictated by a set of boundary conditions known as the epidemic threshold, which depends on the SIR parameters β and µ as well as the network structure itself. Above the epidemic threshold, the pathogen invades and infects a finite fraction of the population. Below the epidemic threshold, the prevalence (total number of infected individuals) remains infinitesimally small in the limit of large networks (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015) . There is growing evidence that such thresholds exist in real-world host-pathogen systems, and intervention strategies are formulated and executed based on estimates of the epidemic threshold. (Dallas et al., 2018; Shulgin et al., 1998; Wallinga et al., 2005; Pourbohloul et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 2005) . Fittingly, the last two decades have seen a significant emphasis on studying epidemic thresholds of contact networks from several disciplines, such as computer science, physics, and epidemiology (Newman, 2002; Wang et al., 2003; Colizza and Vespignani, 2007; Chakrabarti et al., 2008; Gómez et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016 . See Leitch et al. (2019) for a complete survey on the topic of epidemic thresholds.\n",
            " Concurrently but separately, network data has rapidly emerged as a significant area in statistics. Over the last two decades, a substantial amount of methodological advancement has been accomplished in several topics in this area, such as community detection (Bickel and Chen, 2009; Zhao et al., 2012; Rohe et al., 2011; Sengupta and Chen, 2015) , model fitting and model selection (Hoff et al., 2002; Handcock et al., 2007; Krivitsky et al., 2009; Wang and Bickel, 2017; Yan et al., 2014; Bickel and Sarkar, 2016; Sengupta and Chen, 2018) , hypothesis testing (Ghoshdastidar and von Luxburg, 2018; Tang et al., 2017a,b; Bhadra et al., 2019) , and anomaly detection (Zhao et al., 2018; Sengupta, 2018; Komolafe et al., 2019) , to name a few. The state-of-the-art toolbox of statistical network inference includes a range of random graph models and a suite of estimation and inference techniques.\n",
            " However, there has not been any work at the intersection of these two areas, in the sense that the problem of estimating epidemic thresholds has not been investigated from the perspective of statistical network inference. Furthermore, the task of computing the epidemic threshold based on existing results can be computationally infeasible for massive networks. In this paper, we address these gaps by developing a novel sampling-based method to estimate the epidemic threshold under the widely used Chung-Lu model (Aiello et al., 2000) , also known as the configuration model. We prove that our proposed method has theoretical guarantees for both statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. We also provide empirical results demonstrating our method on both synthetic and real-world networks.\n",
            " The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formally set up the prob-lem statement and formulate our proposed methods for approximating the epidemic threshold. In Section 3, we desribe the theoretical properties of our estimators. In Section 4, we report numerical results from synthetic as well as real-world networks. We conclude the paper with discussion and next steps in Section 5. Definition and Description λ(A) spectral radius of the matrix A d i degree of the node i of the network δ i expected degree of the node i of the network S(t), I(t), R(t) number of susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered/removed (R) individuals in the population at time t β infection rate: probability of transmission of a pathogen from an infected individual to a susceptible individual per effective contact (e.g. contact per unit time in continuous-time models, or per time step in discrete-time models) µ recovery rate: probability that an infected individual will recover per unit time (in continuous-time models) or per time step (in discrete-time models)\n",
            " Consider a set of n individuals labelled as 1, . . . , n, and an undirected network (with no self-loops) representing interactions between them. This can represented by an nby-n symmetric adjacency matrix A, where A(i, j) = 1 if individuals i and j interact and A(i, j) = 0 otherwise. Consider a pathogen spreading through this contact network according to an SIR model. From existing work (Chakrabarti et al., 2008; Gómez et al., 2010; Prakash et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016 , we know that the boundary condition for the pathogen to become an epidemic is given by\n",
            " where λ(A) is the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix A.\n",
            " The left hand side of Equation (1) is the ratio of the infection rate to the recovery rate, which is purely a function of the pathogen and independent of the network. As this ratio grows larger, an epidemic becomes more likely, as new infections outpace recoveries. The right hand side of Equation (1) is the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix, which is purely a function of the network and independent of the pathogen. Larger the spectral radius, the more connected the network, and therefore an epidemic becomes more likely. Thus, the boundary condition in Equation (1) connects the two aspects of the contagion process, the pathogen transmissibility which is quantified by β/µ, and the social contact network which is quantified by the spectral radius. If β µ < 1 λ(A) , the pathogen dies out, and if β µ > 1 λ(A) , the pathogen becomes an epidemic. Given a social contact network, the inverse of the spectral radius of its adjacency matrix represents the epidemic threshold for the network. Any pathogen whose transmissiblity ratio is greater than this threshold is going to cause an epidemic, whereas any pathogen whose transmissiblity ratio is less than this threshold is going to die out. Therefore, a key problem in network epidemiology is to compute the spectral radius of the social contact network.\n",
            " Realistic urban social networks that are used in modeling contagion processes have millions of nodes (Eubank et al., 2004; Barrett et al., 2008) . To compute the epidemic threshold of such networks, we need to find the largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix A. This is challenging because of two reasons.\n",
            " 1. First, from a computational perspective, eigenvalue algorithms have computational complexity of Ω(n 2 ) or higher. For massive social contact networks with millions of nodes, this can become too burdensome.\n",
            " 2. Second, from a statistical perspective, eigenvalue algorithms require the entire adjacency matrix for the full network of n individuals. It can be challenging or expensive to collect interaction data of n individuals of a massive population (e.g., an urban metropolis). Furthermore, eigenvalue algorithms typically require the full matrix to be stored in the random-access memory of the computer, which can be infeasible for massive social contact networks which are too large to be stored.\n",
            " The first issue could be resolved if we could compute the epidemic threshold in a computationally efficient manner. The second issue could be resolved if we could compute the epidemic threshold only using data on a small subset of the population. In this paper, we aim to resolve both issues by developing two approximation methods for computing the spectral radius.\n",
            " To address these problems, let us look at the spectral radius, λ(A), from the perspective of random graph models. The statistical model is given by A ∼ P , which is short-hand for A(i, j) ∼ Bernoulli(P (i, j)) for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Then λ(A) converges to λ(P ) in probability under some mild conditions (Chung and Radcliffe, 2011; Benaych-Georges et al., 2019; Bordenave et al., 2020) . To make a formal statement regarding this convergence, we reproduce below a slightly paraphrased version (for notational consistency) of an existing result in this context. Lemma 1 (Theorem 1 of Chung and Radcliffe (2011)). Let\n",
            " be the maximum expected degree, and suppose that for some > 0, ∆ > 4 9 log(2n/ )\n",
            " for sufficiently large n. Then with probability at least 1 − , for sufficiently large n,\n",
            " To make note of a somewhat subtle point: from an inferential perspective it is tempting to view the above result as a consistency result, where λ(P ) is the population quantity or parameter of interest and λ(A) is its estimator. However, in the context of epidemic thresholds, we are interested in the random variable λ(A) itself, as we want to study the contagion spread conditional on a given social contact network. Therefore, in the present context, the above result should not be interpreted as a consistency result.\n",
            " Rather, we can use the convergence result in a different way. For massive networks, the random variable λ(A), which we wish to compute but find it infeasible to do so, is close to the parameter λ(P ). Suppose we can find a random variable T (A) which also converges in probability to λ(P ), and is computationally efficient. Since T (A) and λ(A) both converge in probability to λ(P ), we can use T (A) as an accurate proxy for λ(A). This would address the first of the two issues described at the beginning of this subsection. Furthermore, if T (A) can be computed from a small subset of the data, that would also solve the second issue. This is our central heuristic, which we are going to formalize next.\n",
            " So far, we have not made any structural assumptions on P , we have simply considered the generic inhomogeneous random graph model. Under such a general model, it is very difficult to formulate a statistic T (A) which is cheap to compute and converges to λ(P ). Therefore, we now introduce a structural assumption on P , in the form of the well-known Chung-Lu model that was introduced by Aiello et al. (2000) and subsequently studied in many papers (Chung and Lu, 2002; Chung et al., 2003; Decreusefond et al., 2012; Pinar et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2017) . For a network with n nodes, let δ = (δ 1 , . . . , δ n ) be the vector of expected degrees. Then under the Chung-Lu model,\n",
            " This formulation preserves E[d i ] = δ i , where d i is the degree of the i th node, and is very flexible with respect to degree heterogeneity.\n",
            " Under model (2), note that rank(P ) = 1, and we have\n",
            " Recall that we are looking for some computationally efficient T (A) which converges in probability to λ(P ). We now know that under the Chung-Lu model, λ(P ) is equal to the ratio of the second moment to the first moment of the degree distribution. Therefore, a simple estimator of λ(P ) is given by the sample analogue of this ratio, i.e.,\n",
            " (\n",
            " We now want to demonstrate that approximating λ(A) by T 1 (A) provides us with very substantial computational savings with little loss of accuracy. The approximation error can be quantified as\n",
            " and our goal is to show that e 1 (A) → 0 in probability, while the computational cost of T 1 (A) is much smaller than that of λ(A). We will show this both from a theoretical perspective and an empirical perspective. We next describe the empirical results from a simulation study, and we postpone the theoretical discussion to Section 3 for organizational clarity.\n",
            " We used n = 5000, 10000, and constructed a Chung-Lu random graph model where P (i, j) = θ i θ j . The model parameters θ 1 , . . . , θ n were uniformly sampled from (0, 0.25). Then, we randomly generated 100 networks from the model, and computed λ(A) and T 1 (A). The results are reported in Table 2 . Average runtime for the moment based estimator, T 1 (A), is only 0.07 seconds for n = 5000 and 0.35 seconds for n = 10000, whereas for the spectral radius, λ(A), it is 78.2 seconds and 606.44 seconds respectively, which makes the latter 1100-1700 times more computationally burdensome. The average error for T 1 (A) is very small, and so is the SD of errors. Thus, even for moderately sized networks where n = 5000 or n = 10000, using T 1 (A) as a proxy for λ(A) can reduce the computational cost to a great extent, and the corresponding loss in accuracy is very small. For massive networks where n is in millions, this advantage of T 1 (A) over λ(A) is even greater; however, the computational burden for λ(A) becomes so large that this case is difficult to illustrate using standard computing equipment.\n",
            " Thus, T 1 (A) provides us with a computationally efficient and statistically accurate method for finding the epidemic threshold. \n",
            " The first approximation, T 1 (A), provides us with a computationally efficient method for finding the epidemic threshold. This addresses the first issue pointed out at the beginning of Section 2.1. However, computing T 1 (A) requires data on the degree of all n nodes of the network. Therefore, this does not solve the second issue pointed out at the beginning of Section 2.1. We now propose a second alternative, T 2 , to address the second issue. The idea behind this approximation is based on the same heuristic that was laid out in Section 2.2. Since λ(P ) is a function of degree moments, we can estimate these moments using observed node degrees. In defining T 1 (A), we used observed degrees of all n nodes in the network. However, we can also estimate the degree moments by considering a small sample of nodes, based on random walk sampling. The algorithm for computing T 2 is given in Algorithm 1.\n",

Let L = I − D −1/2 AD −1/2 denote the normalized Laplacian. Let A be a random graph generated from the given expected degrees model, with expected degrees {δ i }, if the minimum expected degree δ min satisfies δ min ln(n), then with probability at least 1 − 1/n = 1 − o(1), we have that for all eigenvalues λ k (L) > λ min (L) of the Laplacian of G,\n",
            " It follows above that ε(Q) = 1−λ 2 (Q) = 1−λ 2 (D −1/2 AD −1/2 ) = λ n−1 (I−D −1/2 AD −1/2 ) = 1 − o(1).

In addition, Corollary 6.1 shows that the number of nodes that we need to query in order to have an accurate approximation is much smaller than n. Furthermore, computing T 2 only requires node sampling and counting degrees, and therefore the runtime is much smaller than eigenvalue algorithms. Therefore, T 2 (A) is a computationally efficient and statistically accurate approximation of the epidemic threshold, while also requiring a much smaller data budget compared to T 1 (A).\n",

            " The second dataset is generated from the preferential attachment model , where each incoming node adds 5 edges to the existing nodes, the probability of choosing a specific node as neighbor being proportional to the current degree of that node. While the preferential attachment model naturally gives rise to a directed graph, we convert the graph to an undirected one before running our algorithm. It is interesting to note that even in this case the Chung-Lu model does not hold, our first approximation, T 1 (A), is close to λ(A).\n",
            " In each of the networks, the random walk algorithm presented in Algorithm 1 was used for sampling. The random walk was started from an arbitrary node and every 10 th node was sampled (to account for the mixing time) from the walk. These samples were then used to calculate T 2 (A). This experiment was repeated 10 times. These gave estimates T 1 2 , . . . , T 10 2 . We then calculate two relative errors ∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 10},\n",
            " We plot the averages of { T 1−T 2 i } and { λ−T 2 i } against the actual number of nodes seen by the random walk. Note that the x-axis accurately reflect how many times the algorithm actually queried the network, not just the number of samples used. Measuring the cost of uniform node sampling in this setting, for instance, would need to keep track of how many nodes are touched by a Metropolis-Hastings walk that implements the uniform distribution. Figure 1 demonstrates the results. For the two synthetic networks, the algorithm is able to get a 10% approximation to the statistic T 1 (A) by exploring at most 10% of the network. With more samples from the random walk, the mean relative errors settle to around 4-5%. However, once we measure the mean relative errors with respect to λ(A), it becomes clearer that the estimator T 2 (A) does better when the graph is closer to the assumed (i.e. Chung-Lu) model. For the Chung-Lu graph, the mean error λ−T 2 essentially is very similar to T 1−T 2 , which is to be expected. For the preferential attachment graph too, it is clear that the estimate T 2 is able to achieve a better than 10% relative error approximation of λ(A).\n",
            " Note that, if we were instead counting only the nodes whose degrees were actually used for estimation, the fraction of network used would be roughly 1 − 2% in all the cases, the majority of the node cost actually goes in making the random walk mix. \n",
            " In this work, we investigated the problem of computing SIR epidemic thresholds of social contact networks from the perspective of statistical inference. We considered the two challenges that arise in this context, due to high computational and data-collection complexity of the spectral radius. For the Chung-Lu network generative model, the spectral radius can be characterized in terms of the degree moments. We utilized this fact to develop two approximations of the spectral radius. The first approximation is computationally efficient and statistically accurate, but requires data on observed degrees of all nodes. The second approximation retains the computationally efficiency and statistically accuracy of the first approximation, while also reducing the number of queries or the sample size quite substantially. The results seem very promising for networks arising from the Chung-Lu and preferential attachment generative models.\n",
            " There are several interesting and important future directions. The methods proposed in this paper have provable guarantees only under the Chung-Lu model, although it works very well under the preferential attachment model. This seems to indicate that the degree based approximation might be applicable to a wider class of models. On the other hand, this leaves open the question of developing a better \"model-free\" estimator, as well as asking similar questions about other network features.\n",
            " In this work we only considered the problem of accurate approximation of the epidemic threshold. From a statistical as well as a real-world perspective, there are several related inference questions. These include uncertainty quantification, confidence intervals, onesample and two-sample testing, etc.\n",

In this paper we only considered static social contact networks, and in future we hope to study epidemic thresholds for time-varying or dynamic networks.\n",
            " We do realize that in the face of the current pandemic, while it is important to pursue research relevant to it, it is also important to be responsible in following the proper scientific process. We would like to state that in this work, the question of epidemic threshold estimation has been formalized from a theoretical viewpoint in a much used, but simple, random graph model. We are not yet at a position to give any guarantees about the performance of our estimator in real social networks. We do hope, however, that the techniques developed here can be further refined to work to give reliable estimators in practical settings.\n",

            "Title: Disease Transmission and Networks q\n",
            "Body Text: Animals living in large groups are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. The close proximity of individuals offers excellent transmission opportunities to a pathogen that is spread by direct contact between hosts. Many studies show a positive relationship between group size and parasitism in terms of prevalence (proportion of infected individuals in a group) and intensity (number of pathogens per individual) (Strassmann, 1981; Côté and Poulinb, 1995; Rifkin et al., 2012) . If the host population is homogeneous in exposure and susceptibility to a pathogen, the birth and death rates of the host and the contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals are sufficient to predict the infection dynamics. However, groups are rarely homogeneous and individuals differ among themselves in various respects such as age, sex, physiological state, behavior, and spatial location. This causes individuals to differ in their probability of becoming infected and transmitting the infection, making it more difficult to predict the trajectory of an infection.\n",
            " The rate at which an infection spreads and whether it persists in the population depend on the magnitude of the key epidemiological parameter, R 0 , or the mean number of infections caused by a single infected individual. In order to stop an epidemic outbreak, R 0 must be maintained below 1. According to the mass-action SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model, the most basic model of epidemic spread, R 0 ¼bTS, where b is the transmission coefficient that incorporates both infectiousness and contact rate of the infected individuals, T is the duration of infectiousness, and S is the available number of susceptible individuals (Bjørnstad et al., 2002; Volz and Meyers, 2007) . The simple SIR model has provided many important insights into the epidemiology of a wide range of pathogens but its fundamental assumption of homogeneous mixing among individuals is clearly unrealistic. Population-level estimates of R 0 can obscure the considerable variation in contact rate and infectiousness among individuals. Several studies have shown that typically, 80% of the transmission events are contributed by 20% of the host population: a trend that is referred to as the 80/20 rule (Perkins et al., 2003; Paull et al., 2012) . This was highlighted during the recent global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) when a few infected individuals were responsible for giving rise to an unusually large number of secondary cases (Galvani and May, 2005) . Whether or not infected individuals have contact rates that are disproportionately higher than the population average has important implications because public-health programs generally rely on the immunization of only a fraction of the hosts to protect the entire population.\n",
            " The effects of host heterogeneity on the spread of infectious disease can be most simply modeled by dividing a population into subpopulations with different within-group and between-group transmission rates. A more explicit approach is to use models that incorporate the structure of the actual contact network in the population (Scott, 2017) . Unlike the continually changing set of contacts in random mixing models, each individual is assigned a finite set of contacts to who they can transmit infection and from who they can be infected. Predictions from network models can be considerably different from those that use mean-based approaches. Although individuals may have the same number of contacts per unit time in both network and mass action models, the fixed contact structure in networks can lead to rapid, localized spread of an infection followed by a slowing down of the process as the number of susceptible individuals depletes locally. This makes disease extinctions more likely than outbreaks though the latter are more explosive if they occur.\n",
            " The use of network models also has bearing on the evolution of the pathogens themselves. Given their high reproductive rates, pathogens are likely to undergo rapid selection to adapt to the available transmission routes between infected and susceptible individuals (Bishop et al., 2000) . Both theoretical and experimental results show that high transmission rates are selected in localized networks where there is intense competition for susceptible hosts while networks that are more global in their connectivity select for lower transmission rates due to lack of such competition. Localized contact structure also selects for a higher diversity in the pathogen population in contrast to a randomly mixed host population where cross-immunity to similar strains structures the pathogen population into discrete, nonoverlapping strains.\n",
            " A transmission network is generally defined by a matrix X that describes the connections among all the individuals within a group. In its simplest form, the matrix is unweighted, with x ij ¼1, if there is one or more interactions that can transmit an infection and x ij ¼0 if there is none. The matrix is also generally undirected, meaning that infection can pass either way across an interaction or x ij ¼x ji . More detailed models can be constructed using weighted, directed networks (Opsahl et al., 2010) . The structure of the transmission network can be characterized by a number of parameters that can be quantified from these matrices. The most commonly used ones are (1) degree, the number of connections an individual has; (2) density, the proportion of existing connections out of all possible ones; (3) path length, the average number of links that connect any two individuals; and (4) clustering, the density of the local neighborhood or cliquishness (Boccaletti et al., 2006) . Focal measures such as degree can identify high-risk individuals in the population and can be used to inform surveillance and infection control strategies. Network level measures such as average path length and clustering coefficient can make predictions about the spread of the infection in the population. Critical points that reflect order of magnitude shifts in network properties and the consequent propagation of an epidemic can be identified from phase transitions in network parameters.\n",
            " Network models are difficult and time consuming to build because they require information about the connectivity between every pair of individuals in a group. In this effort, researchers have mainly relied on infection tracing that describes the actual connections through which the infection spreads or contact tracing that looks at all the potential connections from a source individual (Keeling and Eames, 2005) . Network models are also complex in terms of their statistical evaluation unlike differential equations based mass-mixing models. Moreover, as different diseases are transmitted via different transmission pathways, network models are disease specific and cannot be easily generalized. In the face of these difficulties, simulating networks with different structures ( Fig. 1) and studying the parameters that influence transmission dynamics has been an important and influential research paradigm.\n",
            " In these types of networks, each individual has a fixed number of random connections, resulting in a network with no clustering and short path lengths (Barabási and Albert, 1999) . The early growth rate of an infectious process and the final epidemic size are lower in these networks compared with the mass-action model, largely because of the quick depletion of the local environment of susceptible individuals around an infected individual.\n",
            " In these networks, individuals are connected only to their adjacent neighbors, leading to a homogeneous network with high clustering and long path lengths (Olfati-Saber and Shamma, 2005) . This leads to an even stronger depletion of the local environment and thus the growth rate of the infection. \n",
            " The transmission properties of small-world networks have generated a lot of interest and are important to understand because many biological networks including human social networks show small-world properties Lago-Fernández et al., 2000) . They lie somewhere between regular and random networks, displaying high clustering but small path lengths due to the existence of a few long-range connections. Even though the transmission process is still largely localized, the few longrange links allow the infection to spread relatively quickly and more synchronously over the entire network. Small-world networks may or may not have a scale-free structure.\n",
            " These networks are characterized by an extreme heterogeneity in connectivity, the number of contacts per individual being described by a power law distribution (Barabási and Bonabeau, 2003) . A few highly connected individuals, called superspreaders in the epidemic context, have a disproportionately high influence on the transmission process (Zhou et al., 2006) . Networks of human sexual contacts have been shown to follow such a distribution and the transmission and maintenance of sexually transmitted diseases thus depends mainly on a few promiscuous individuals (Liljeros et al., 2001) . In such networks, control measures directed at random individuals are quite ineffective while targeted interventions work really well. By immunizing the superspreaders, the contact network becomes sparser by orders of magnitude and brings about a drastic reduction in the number of transmission events.\n",
            " Complex network models being hard to parameterize can lead to predictions that are no more reliable or maybe even worse than those from simpler frameworks. However, with the relative dearth of suitable experimental systems with sufficient social complexity, opportunistically obtained data about the course of natural epidemics in humans have been the only major recourse for testing network models. In this context, the honeybee colony can prove to be an ideal model system. Honeybees not only provide the setting of a crowded social group that is susceptible to a vast array of infectious diseases but they are also extremely amenable to a variety of experimental paradigms at both the individual and the social level. The long association of honeybees and their pathogens over evolutionary time provides a backdrop to test how the network of social interactions in the colony could serve as the central arena for host-pathogen dynamics (Nazzi et al., 2012) . The pathogens can exploit the network to rapidly spread across the colony, while the host can use its structural properties as a mechanism to resist the spread. The recent finding that honeybees possess only one-third as many genes for immunity as other insects strongly suggests that the structure of social organization is an important mechanism that compensates for a lower physiological immunocompetence (Evans et al., 2006) .\n",
            " Interaction networks in a social insect colony could be organized according to one of the following designs: (1) work-chains with each individual performing all the required parts of a given task, (2) work-chains with each individual performing one and only one part of a task with one or more other individuals completing the rest, and (3) work-chains with each individual performing only one part of a task at any given time but performing all the parts equally frequently. The efficiency and the reliability of material and information flow are substantially incremented in each successive type of network, which is adaptive for ergonomic purposes. It is however less recognized that the same design features will also promote the transmission efficiency of pathogens, increasing the vulnerability of the colony to an infectious disease.\n",
            " Food, information, as well as pathogens primarily enter a honeybee colony from the environment through the foragers. Nearestneighbor based interactions drive the subsequent transfer process, spreading these across the colony. With the individuals spatially distributed within the colony according to their ages, this results in a centripetal flow from the oldest individuals at the outer edge of the colony to the youngest ones residing at the center (Tilman, 1982) . This flow pattern imparts some amount of protection to the most valuable youngest members from invading pathogens: a phenomenon that can be termed 'organizational immunity'. (Ping and Yihua, 2008) . This social contact network in the colony is therefore highly structured and nonrandom, leading to a pool of individuals that is heterogeneous with respect to its probability of contacting, manifesting, and transmitting an infection, presenting an invading pathogen with the challenge of negotiating this complex landscape (Fig. 2) .\n",
            " Superimposed on this general age-based interaction pattern, one also sees that only a minority of the individuals in the colony are the primary drivers of the majority of the transfer process. This gives the interaction network an appearance of a scale-free structure. In contrast to such heterogeneous connectivity observed in the large honeybee colonies, individuals are more uniformly connected to each other in social insect species with smaller colony sizes. Within-species comparisons suggest that colony size is a primary driver of network structure and complete mixing becomes more and more improbable with increasing number of individuals. There is considerable variation in network structure even among colonies of similar sizes and it has been shown that the density of contact network in the colony determines the spread of a contagious pathogen within it.\n",
            " Small perturbations in the structure of social organization can bring about large changes in transmission dynamics. Many honeybee diseases, which remain in the background at a low level in the colony, can rapidly turn lethal and erupt into an epidemic under certain conditions generally referred to as 'stress'. Investigation of these so-called 'stress' conditions suggest that they translate into disruption of the normal social organization in the colony in the face of contingencies such as a nectar flow in the environment, high demand for a certain task, or a rapid increase in colony population size (Martin, 2001; Guzmán-Novoa et al., 2010) . The resulting higher activity level and more generalization of labor profiles can lead to higher contact rates or other changes in social network structure.\n",
            " A disease can also bring about some restructuring of the social organization in the colony. Disease at an individual level is defined as a disruption of homeostatic mechanisms, leading to an alteration in the normal set point of an organism and its symptoms are the physiological mechanisms that restore it. This definition can be extended to an epidemic being a process that disrupts the social organization critical to the functioning of a group and its symptoms are mechanisms that, via collective action of its members, attempt to restore the social structure. It has been speculated that a disease symptom such as bees starting to forage at a younger age is an adaptive response on the part of the host that serves to reduce within-colony transmission of the disease by keeping infected bees outside . However, it is equally plausible that such a response can in fact increase transmission rates by contaminating the food they collect. Behavioral fever in response to an infection, which can inhibit the development of a pathogen, requires bees to cluster more tightly that can in turn increase the contact rate among them (Mayack and Naug, 2010) . Bees infected with a pathogen have also been shown to incur an energetic stress that increases their hunger level, leading them to be more eager solicitors but more reluctant donors of food. This could lead uninfected and infected bees to occupy different positions in the contact network in terms of sources and sinks in the transmission chain. It is important to note here that the structure of the social network in the colony is an emergent property that arises from individual behavior, which can be altered by simple pathophysiological mechanisms arising from a disease.\n",
            " For disease ecologists interested in using network theory, the development of network statistics remains a major research focus. A second area of rapidly developing interest is dynamic networks which account for the possibility that the structure of the contact networks might not remain constant over time, maybe partly as a consequence of the disease outbreak itself. More importantly, empirical research has lagged behind the pace of theoretical work made possible by increased computational power. Matching efforts to develop laboratory experimental systems are urgently needed to explore the interaction between network structure and disease dynamics. Integration of behavioral biology and physiology to the already existing framework of ecology, evolution, and mathematical modeling would also be critical to our understanding of the structural and functional properties of biological networks.\n",
            " Research on the proximate basis underlying the behavioral interactions among individuals will give insights into the role of demographic and environmental factors on disease dynamics via their effects on social structure. It will also help answer the important questions of how the pathophysiology of a disease can alter the structure of the contact network and whether such symptomatic restructuring benefits the host or the pathogen. In social insect groups where the colony social network is considered to be primarily a product of ergonomic considerations, it is important to explore whether pathogens have played any selective role in its design. This addresses the broad issue of how any group of interconnected units, whether a bee colony or a computer cluster, deals with the challenge of shielding its network from attacks without seriously compromising its performance.\n",
            " It is being increasingly recognized that excessive use of antimicrobials to treat diseases selects for resistant strains of pathogens that can no longer be eliminated by the same drugs. Intervention measures that have short-term epidemiological benefits but long-term evolutionary repercussions have led to the recent resurgence of many diseases and the heightened virulence of pathogen populations. This has led to the suggestion that understanding the natural dynamics of a disease from an evolutionary, ecological, and behavioral perspective might provide pointers to preventive and curative methods that are more sustainable. There are plenty of accounts concerning behavior and customs in humans that affect the transmission of infectious diseases. Agricultural practices such as the clearing of land and irrigation have brought increased contact between human populations and animal reservoirs of diseases such as schistosomiasis and malaria (Steinmann et al., 2006) . Urbanization has brought about increased transmission of lyme disease, cholera, dengue, and leishmaniasis (Kendall et al., 1991; Desjeux, 2001; Bradley and Altizer, 2007; Chowdhury et al., 2011) . Changes in sexual behavior have had a large influence on the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases (Bunnell et al., 2006; Satterwhite et al., 2007) . With the current threat of these numerous emerging diseases, it has become extremely important to understand the dynamics of infectious processes in the context of crowded living conditions that characterize many animal groups and humans. An understanding of the behavioral processes that define the structure of a social group will help identify the transmission pathways used by pathogens to spread and suggest possible ways to manage the social structure as a counteractive measure to both prevent and control the spread of a likely epidemic. \n",

            "Body Text: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. Respiratory viruses, whose pathogen role have been underestimated for many years, account for more than 22% of adult CAP cases [1, 2] . Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses, ubiquitous in the environment, and are also a common cause of respiratory infections. HAdV pneumonia typically is limited to newborns, immunocompromised hosts, and school or military camp populations [3] . Severe HAdV pneumonia has been frequently described in immunocompromised patients. Respiratory infection caused by HAdV in immunocompetent patients is usually thought to be mild and self-limited. However, with advances in modern molecular techniques, HAdV has been increasingly found to be involved in sporadic cases and outbreaks of severe CAP in healthy adults [4, 5] .\n",
            " To date, at least 69 HAdV genotypes have been recognized, and they are assigned to seven subgroups (A-G) according to genetic, biophysical and biochemical characteristics [6] . Species B (HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14) is the predominant HAdV specie associated with respiratory infections among adults. HAdV-55, a genotype recombination between HAdV-11 and HAdV-14, has been the reported cause of sporadic or outbreak events of CAP in Turkey [7] , Singapore [8] , Korea [9] and China from 2004. HAdV-55-related sequential outbreaks in several provinces and regions of China gained increased attention since 2006 [10] [11] [12] . As just one pathogen of CAP, HAdV accounts for 5% of adult CAP cases in northern China between 2010 and 2012, while HAdV-55 accounts for more than 40% of identified HAdV positive samples [2] . Comparative studies showed that the serotypes of HAdV may be one of the factors which determine the severity of adenoviral pneumonia. HAdV-55 was thought to be more closely associated with severe pneumonia as compared to other serotypes (HAdV-3, -7 and -14) [2] . Clinical understanding of severe CAP induced by HAdV-55 is still limited, though the pathogen has been fully characterized by whole-genome sequencing. Current knowledge of HAdV-55-induced severe pneumonia is mainly derived from single case reports or relatively small, single-center series.\n",
            " Beginning in February 2012, virus screening was carried out for an etiological study of adult severe CAP at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) in Beijing and the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University (SHHMU) in Hebei province, China. These two institutions, which have high referral rate in Northern China, encounter multiple cases of HAdV pneumonia annually. The present multicenter case series report describes in detail the clinical features and outcomes of severe HAdV CAP in immunocompetent adults.\n",
            " The institutional ethics review boards of PUMCH and SHHMU approved this retrospective study. All data on the study patients was analyzed anonymously. The requirement for informed consent by individual patients was waived given the retrospective nature of the study. We performed a multicentre retrospective review of all consecutive patients diagnosed with severe HAdV CAP in the Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the two hospitals between February 1, 2012 and April 30, 2014. The criteria for severe CAP was defined by modified American Thoracic Society criteria [13] or risk class V of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) [14] . HAdV infection was confirmed by positive multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HAdV from lower respiratory tract samples, such as sputum, tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Additionally, we required negative other microbiological testing including bacterial, fungal or other common respiratory viruses at admission. Patients with HIV infection or neutropenia, those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy, pregnant or breast-feeding women, and those with malignant neoplasms were excluded.\n",
            " CAP patients whose clinical conditions deteriorated rapidly despite appropriate use of broadspectrum antibiotics for 2-3 days were suspected of having atypical pneumonia. Lower respiratory tract samples, urine, blood, and acute and convalescent serum samples were collected for thorough microbiological tests including: (1) sputum specimens for staining and microbiological cultures; (2) urine specimens for Legionella pneumophila and S. pneumonia antigen detection; (3) blood cultures; (4) lower respiratory tract samples for virus real-time PCR detection (tested viruses included: HAdV, rhinovirus, cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus); (5) acute and convalescent serum samples for Chlamydia Pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila antibody titer determination.\n",

            " Investigators created a standardized data form for clinical information collection that included demographics (age, sex and smoking status), PSI score (to assess the severity of illness at admission), comorbidities, clinical symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest pain, diarrhea, myalgias and sore throat), vital signs, laboratory tests, arterial blood gas analysis results, microbiological findings (including HAdV types) and chest radiologic characteristics. Concomitant medications, respiratory support, complications (e.g. use of mechanical ventilation or septic shock) and overall outcomes were also recorded.\n",
            " Continuous variables are expressed as median (interquartile range) and categorical variables as number and percent. Differences between groups were assessed with the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Significance was fixed at P<0.05.\n",
            " A total 15 cases (seven from SHHMU and eight from PUMCH) were confirmed with HAdV as the only pathogen of pneumonia. Two patients with HAdV positive samples were excluded due to possible coinfection with Legionella pneumophila and S. pneumonia respectively. All 15 patients were admitted to the ICU and fulfilled the criteria of severe CAP and of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n",
            " Patients with severe HAdV CAP usually were young and middle-aged adults and the median age was 30 years (range, 18 to 52 years). Male gender (73.3%) was more common than female gender, and all patients who did not survive were male. All 15 patients were non-immunocompromised. Three patients (who were aged >50) had underlying diseases of hypertension. Seven patients were smokers. Most patients (14 of 15 patients) came from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region of Northern China. The illnesses of all patients occurred in the winter and spring seasons, and most HAdVs (60%) were identified in April. Definitive HAdV typing of the 15 cases were all classed as species B (11 were type 55, two were type 7, one was type 3, and one was type 14) (see Fig 1) .\n",
            " As shown in Table 1 , flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough and little sputum, were most commonly observed at the onset of illness. All patients presented with a high fever, with a median body temperature of 39.8°C (range, 39.0°C to 40.8°C), which persisted for 7 days (range, 1 to 10 days). Most clinical symptoms and signs between survivors and non-survivors did not differ, except for PSI score and respiratory rate; these were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (P = 0.013 and 0.022, respectively). The median time from onset to ICU admission was seven days, and most patients (86.7%) showed apparent dyspnea at admission. Arterial blood gas analysis at ICU admission revealed profound hypoxia, with a median PaO 2 /FiO 2 of 120 mmHg. PaO 2 /FiO 2 in non-survivors was significantly lower than that in survivors (p = 0.019). There was no difference in laboratory findings between survivors and non-survivors, except that hypersensitive CRP in non-survivors were significantly lower than in survivors (P = 0.026) ( Table 2) . White blood cell counts in most patients were in the normal range.\n",
            " Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CK), creatinine and urea nitrogen levels were higher in non-survivors, but the differences were not significant.\n",
            " Consolidation (86.7%), ground-grass opacities (GGOs) (66.7%), and pleural effusions (73.3%) were the most common findings in severe HAdV CAP (Table 2) . Diffuse GGOs were revealed as predominant in two patients (13.3%) (Fig 2A) . Within one week after illness onset, focal consolidation was the predominant finding in ten patients (Figs 2B and 3A), while three patients showed bilateral multiple consolidations accompanied by GGOs in two patients ( Fig  2C) . The most commonly involved lobe was the right lower lobe (n = 5), followed by the left lower lobe (n = 3), left upper lobe (n = 1), and right upper lobe (n = 1). Follow-up radiologic findings in 13 patients with consolidation showed the rapid development of bilateral consolidations within 10 days after illness onset, usually accompanied by adjacent GGOs and pleural effusions (Fig 2D and S1 Fig). The number of lobes with consolidation was significantly increased in non-survivors than in survivors (p = 0.011). The parenchymal abnormalities began to absorb about two weeks after illness onset, with no appearances of fibrosis.\n",
            " Overall treatment outcomes of study patients are summarized in Table 2 . Empirical broadspectrum intravenous antibiotics were given to all the patients, while eight were prescribed antiviral drugs. Antiviral treatment was started prior to the confirmation of viral pneumonia in our study. Acylovir, gancyclovir, oseltamivir and ribavirin are all widely used empirically in China. In our study, oseltamivir was used in all eight patients who received antiviral drugs, while ribavirin and gancyclovir were used in combination with oseltamivir in four and three patients, respectively. Ten out of 15 (66.7%) patients received adjuvant intravenous immunoglobulin for 3-5 days, while fourteen (93.3%) received corticosteroids for 3-10 days, including hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone. Hospital acquired pulmonary infections developed in seven cases, and Acinetobacter baumannii was the dominating pathogen. Four patients did not survive (26.7%). One case died of respiratory failure caused by ARDS and three other patients died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome which mainly included respiratory failure and septic shock. The need for mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors were similar between non-survivors and survivors. Length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation in non-survivors were less than that in survivors, but the differences were not significant.\n",
            " In the past decade, adult CAP induced by HAdV has been causing increased concern worldwide, especially in China. HAdV accounted for 0.8% of adult acute respiratory tract infections in Beijing between 2005 and 2010, while HAdV-3 was the most frequently detected serotype [15] . However, the proportion of HAdV CAP increased to 4.2%-5% in the following two years [2, 16] , and HAdV-55 became the predominant culprit. HAdV-55 is thought to be closely associated with severe CAP, and the results of our study verified this phenomenon again. To the best of our knowledge, the number of patients needed mechanical ventilation (14 patients) in this report is significantly more than those of two to six cases in all recent investigations of HAdV-55 related severe CAP. Our study may provide some new understanding for clinical characteristics of HAdV-55 related severe CAP in immunocompetent adults. Demographics in our report were consistent with the previous investigations [17, 18] . Young and middle-aged male adults were susceptible hosts for severe HAdV CAP. All patients of severe HAdV CAP occurred in the winter and spring seasons just after the influenza epidemic, which indicates that the relationship between HAdV CAP and influenza may be an appropriate focus for future research. All severe CAP caused by HAdV-55 in immunocompetent adults in China in previous investigations occurred in Northern China, mainly in Baoding, Hebei province and Beijing. The wider dispersion of our cases suggests that HAdV-55 is still active in Northern China, and might be expanding its scope of influence. The clinical features and disease progression of our cases are highly similar to those of ARDS caused by HAdV-55 or other types of HAdV described in previous reports [19] . All patients presented with high fevers and cough. Common manifestations of HAdV infection such as diarrhea or conjunctivitis were not common in our patients. PSI scores, one of the most commonly used severity assessment tools for CAP, can also provide important prognostic information for HAdV-55 induced CAP [2] . In this report, absence of underlying diseases and abnormal laboratory findings such as decreased hematocrit, hyponatremia and hyperglycemia, highlight the contribution of abnormal respiratory rate and PaO 2 /FiO 2 to the high values we saw in patients' PSI scores. Respiratory rate is an independent risk marker for in-hospital mortality of CAP [20] . Low CRP values are commonly considered to be associated with a less severe systemic inflammatory response, which should reflect a better prognosis. Interestingly, our data showed that among patients with ARDS caused by HAdV, a low initial serum CRP level at admission correlated to a fatal outcome. Interpretation of this result may be difficult, though a similar phenomenon was found in severe CAP caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae [21] and CAP patients with liver cirrhosis [22] . CRP is an acute phase protein, which is synthesized by the liver in response to tissue damage. It may be reasonable to speculate that severe HAdV CAP accompanied by slightly elevated CRP may indicate impairment of the protective inflammatory response.\n",
            " In accordance with the reputation of respiratory viruses for causing diffuse interstitial infiltrates, Clark reported bilateral GGOs as the most common abnormality in 22 immunocompetent adults of adenovirus pneumonia [4] . However, more and more research supports consolidation rather than interstitial infiltrates as the main imaging characteristic of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. To date, adenovirus is the only virus known to cause focal or lobar consolidation (the typical manifestation of bacterial pneumonia) as its main imaging abnormality. The initial image findings of adenovirus pneumonia, which resemble bacterial pneumonia may mislead diagnosis and treatment. As Gu concluded, single lobar or segmental consolidation was more common in patients without ARDS, while patients with ARDS had bilateral and multilobar lung consolidations [17] . Compared to survivors in this report, non-survivors had more extensive consolidations which correlated with respiratory rate and PaO 2 /FiO 2 .\n",
            " At present there is no specific treatment for severe HAdV pneumonia and high mortality rates are often reported in cases of severe HAdV pneumonia. Among patients needing mechanical ventilation in previous reports about severe HAdV-55 pneumonia, nine out of 22 (40.9%) cases died [2, 9, [17] [18] [19] . Early administration of cidofovir showed possible effect in six immunocompetent patients [9] , but randomized controlled trials are lacking and cidofovir is not available in most hospitals in China. Mortality (26.7%) in our study is relatively low and corticosteroids were frequently used in this study. Adjuvant corticosteroids for CAP and ARDS remains controversial. Improved mortality and a good safety record for corticosteroids given to patients with severe CAP were seen by some meta-analyses [23] [24] [25] . However, corticosteroids have also been found to be an independent predictor of mortality or other poor outcomes in multiple studies of other viral pneumonias [26] [27] [28] . The effect of corticosteroids on severe HAdV CAP is still uncertain, although there have been a few case reports. One case of a fatal HAdV-3 pneumonia with hypercytokinemia, \"pulse\" methylprednisolone treatment resulted in the rapid amelioration of the patient's respiratory distress [29] . In a study focused on severe CAP caused by HAdV-55, 10 out of 18 patients received corticosteroids and total mortality was 5.9% [17] . However, given the small sample size and design of our non-controlled study, we can not conclude that corticosteroids are helpful in severe HAdV CAP.\n",
            " Our study has several limitations. First, for the determined HAdV types (especially type 55), whole-genome sequencings were not performed due to its retrospective nature. Second, there were a relatively small number of cases because of the relatively low incidence of severe adenovirus pneumonia. The results of comparison between survivors and non-survivors may also lead to bias due to the unequal number of patients in each group. Finally, treatment effects of cidofovir and other antiviral drugs could not be compared because cidofovir was not available in the two hospitals in this study.\n",
            " In conclusion, HAdV-55 plays a very important role in cases of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults of Northern China, and surveillance of this agent as a cause of severe CAP is warranted. HAdV should be tested in severe CAP patients with initial negative bacterial cultures and a failure to respond to antibiotics, even though image findings and clinical presentation might suggest bacterial pneumonia.\n",

            "Body Text: Bats have been increasingly associated with emerging and re-emerging viruses. The likelihood of possible transmission of these pathogens to humans is ever increasing as a result of human encroachment on animal habitats, climate change and change of human behaviour. Pathogens of particular public health importance are filoviruses [1, 2] , coronaviruses [3, 4] , paramyxoviruses [5, 6] and lyssaviruses [7, 8] . Other viruses, without a known human disease link, have also been detected recently [9] [10] [11] . Some human pathogens, such as Rift Valley fever virus, that have been detected in bats were likely a result of coincidental infection and do not constitute proof that bats play a role as reservoirs [12] .\n",
            " Bats are parasitized by a number of ectoparasites, including mites, bat flies, ticks and fleas, and often by some or all of these simultaneously [13] . The bat flies are members of two families in the Diptera order, namely, the Streblidae and Nycteribiidae, and are highly host-specific obligate ectoparasites of bats [13] [14] [15] . Both bat fly families are hematophagous and potentially capable of (Qiagen).

At the first sign of CPE, culture supernatant was collected, cleared of cellular content by centrifugation (3000ˆg for 5 min), and subsequently fixed in an equal volume of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Hepes buffer (pH 6.9) for visualization of virus particles by negative staining. A Beckman Airfuge ® (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was used to concentrate all samples (10 min at 207 kPa), after which droplets of sample were adsorbed to 0.25% formar-coated copper grids for a minimum of 10 min, rinsed twice in deionised, distilled water and stained briefly in 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.9). For ultramicrotomy, the remaining infected monolayers were flooded with the same fixative overnight, then routinely processed (postfixation in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide, graded ethanol dehydration, infiltration with a low viscosity resin (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) and overnight polymerisation at 70˝C). Seventy nm sections were cut on a Leica EM-UC6, double stained with saturated uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed at 80 kV on a BioTwin Spirit (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA).

RNA was extracted using a column based kit (Direct-Zol RNA kit, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). To increase sensitivity, rRNA was depleted using the same method as described previously [37] . RNAs were converted to cDNA and amplified using SISPA as described previously with modifications [38] . To enhance coverage of the terminal ends, an oligo containing three rGTP at the 3' end (GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCGGCCATTAT GGCCrGrGrG) was added during first-strand cDNA synthesis and the reverse transcriptase was changed to Maxima H Minus (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which has terminal transferase activity that enables addition of the rGTP containing oligo to the 5' end during cDNA synthesis. Amplicons were sheared and libraries prepared using the Illumina TRuSeq DNA Library preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed either on an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina) or NextSeq 500 (Illumina) using either a 2ˆ150 or 2ˆ250 version2 kit. Illumina and SISPA adapter sequences were trimmed from the sequencing reads using Cutadapt-1.2.1 [39] , quality filtering was conducted with Prinseq-lite (-min len 50-derep 14-lc method dust-lc threshold 3-trim ns left 1-trim ns right 1-trim qual right 15) [40] and reads were assembled into contigs using Ray Meta with kmer length = 25 [41] .

            " The MEGA (version 6) program was used to prepare alignments (ClustalW) of nucleic acid segment sequences, deduced amino acid sequences, phylogenetic trees and pairwise distance calculations [42] . The publicly available reovirus sequences used in the analysis were obtained from NCBI-Nucleotide (Genbank). Nucleotide sequences from a small number of viruses from each genus in the Reoviridae family were used to prepare a Maximum Likelihood tree showing the placement of MAHLV in the family based on the full RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoding segment. Maximum Likelihood trees were prepared using amino acid sequences of all open reading frames from all segments, showing the placement of Mahlapitsi virus (MAHLV) in the Orthoreovirus genus relative to other viruses in this genus for which sequence is available on Genbank. Virus sequence accession numbers are summarised in Table 1 . The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model [43] . The tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches (1000 bootstrap iterations).

DNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and the method as described by the manufacturer. Amplification of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was performed with barcoding primers as described by Tortosa et al.: LCO1490 and HCO2198 [13] . Polymerase chain reaction was carried out in 50 µL reactions containing 25 µL MyTaq Red mix 2ˆ(Bioline, London, UK), 2 µL of forward and reverse primer (10 µM), DNA template (10 µL) and nuclease free water (11 µL).

Purified PCR amplicon products were then sequenced at the NICD Core Sequencing Facility (NICD, Sandringham, South Africa).\n",
            " Replication of MAHLV was evaluated in two cell lines: Vero E6 (source African green monkey kidney) and C6-36 (source Aedes albopictus mosquitoes). Cells were grown to 50%-70% confluency in 25 cm 2 flasks, supernatant removed and respective flasks inoculated with 1 mL of 10´1, 10´2, 10´3 and 10´5 dilutions from stock virus (1ˆ10 6 TCID 50 /mL) in EMEM. After 1 h adsorption at 37˝C (VeroE6) or 28˝C (C6-36), the inoculum was removed, cells washed with 5 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fresh EMEM, antibiotics and 2% foetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) added. Cultures were incubated for 13 days at 37˝C (VeroE6) or 28˝C (C6-36) while 0.5 mL aliquots of supernatant were collected from each flask directly after inoculation and addition of fresh medium (day 0), followed by day 4, 7 and 13. RNA was extracted from 140 µL of the serial supernatant collections (QIamp viral RNA kit, Qiagen) and subjected to TaqMan real-time RT-PCR. A Taqman real-time RT-PCR was developed to detect the RdRp gene of MAHLV. Primers and probe sequences are: forward MORV_796F (5'-TAGTGGTTCGTATGCGTGGT-3'), reverse MORV_893R (5'-AACAGCCATTCAATCTCAGG-3') and probe MORV_875P (FAM-GGCACATATCCCTCAACTGG-BHQ), with the number in the oligonucleotide name indicating the nucleic acid position in the segment encoding RdRp. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on the extracted RNA using the Qiagen One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) on a SmartCycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with the following program: reverse transcription (50˝C for 30 min), hot-start Taq activation (95˝C for 15 min) and 50 cycles of amplification (95˝C for 15 s; 52˝C for 25 s plus signal acquisition; 72˝C for 20 s).

            " From a total of 273 bat ectoparasite pools subjected to virus isolation by three blind passages, two yielded an agent that caused obvious cytopathic effects in the form of syncytia (giant cell) formation by three or four days post inoculation (d.p.i.) (Figure 2 ). The parasite pool that yielded MAHLV isolate 2511 was collected from an apparently healthy adult female Rousettus aegyptiacus bat captured at Mahune cave in May 2013. CPE in Vero cells were noted after two blind passages, and the supernatant collected on day five from passage four in a 75 cm 2 flask containing infected Vero cells yielded 1ˆ10 6.25 TCID 50 /mL of the unknown virus. The second parasite pool that yielded MAHLV isolate 06-24 was collected from an apparently healthy juvenile male Rousettus aegyptiacus bat captured at Mahune cave in June 2013. CPE in Vero cells were noted after three blind passages, and the supernatant collected on day five from passage five in a 75 cm 2 flask containing infected Vero cells yielded 1ˆ10 6 TCID 50 /mL of the virus. These supernatants, passage four of 2511 and passage five of 06-24, were used for subsequent identification by TEM and NGS. The ectoparasites from which the viruses were isolated were morphologically identified as bat flies, Eucampsipoda africana Theodor (Diptera: Nycteribiidae) ( Figure 3 ) [44] . Sequencing of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) and alignment to sequences available on Genbank, followed by phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4 ) confirms that the bat flies in this study are closest related to Eucampsipoda spp. identified before. \n",
            " Initial screening of negatively-stained culture supernatants revealed the presence of rounded icosahedrons lacking envelopes, which resembled non-Rotavirus-like virions of the Reoviridae ( Figure 5 ).

TEM observations therefore suggested that the isolated virus belonged to the Reoviridae, sub-family Spinareovirinae. An unbiased next-generation sequencing approach using SISPA amplification confirmed the presence of a novel Orthoreovirus. Initial sequencing results of both isolates yielded enough sequence coverage to identify all 10 segments. A polyetheleneglycol (PEG) precipitated preparation of isolate 06-24 yielded the most viral specific reads and formed 11 contigs aligning to Othoreoviruses using BLASTn and BLASTx. Both the 5' and 3' ends were missing for all the segments, so to obtain complete genomes for each isolate, rRNA depletion and a combination of SISPA and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (SISPA-RACE) was done. Read numbers were also increased by running samples on an Illumina Nextseq 500. Both an increase in the percentage of viral reads aligning to the genome segments and an increase in coverage of the ends were observed. Presence of MAHLV in the original homogenates from which the isolates were obtained was confirmed by SISPA amplification and NGS directly from the homogenates. Expectedly, only a low number of reads from both homogenates mapped to the MAHLV sequence due to the high amount of host sequence obscuring viral specific sequences combined with likely low viral load in the homogenates and the relatively low sensitivity of the SISPA method.\n",

Maximum Likelihood trees were prepared using the deduced amino acid sequences from the open reading frames (ORF's) of all the virus' segments and those of other viruses in the Orthoreovirus genus (Figures 8-10) . A distinct clade is formed by MAHLV, Bush viper reovirus, Baboon orthoreovirus and Broome virus within the genus. The above-mentioned clade is visibly distinct from others composed of bat-associated viruses; the Nelson Bay orthoreovirus and bat-derived mammalian orthoreoviruses. The closest relative of MAHLV, based on sequence homology of a conserved core protein, is Bush viper reovirus (Lambda B nucleic acid identity-63.7%; RdRp amino acid identity-66.3%) while the closest bat-associated virus is Broome virus (LambdaB nucleic acid identity-60.7%; RdRp amino acid identity-58.0%) ( Table 2) . Homology of the divergent major outer capsid protein of MAHLV to known orthoreoviruses is much lower: Sigma B nucleic acid identity-28.7%-41.9%; amino acid identity-5.6%-24.3% (Table 3) .\n",
            " The genome segments of MAHLV were named according to the nucleotide length, which is consistent with the nomenclature of other orthoreoviruses [26] . A summary of the MAHLV genome is given in Table 4 . The total genome size is 23,200 nucleotides and predicted to encode eleven proteins, seven of which are structural. All ten genome segments of MAHLV contain an identical 3' terminal sequence, UCAUC-3', which is conserved between all known species of Orthoreovirus, and an identical 5' terminal sequence, 5'-GGUCA which is unique to MAHLV. Non-coding regions (NCRs) are present at both ends of the genome segments, with the 5' NCRs being shorter in nucleotide length than 3' NCRs. The nucleotide sequences of the two isolates of MAHLV, 2511 and 06-24, are not identical. Nucleotide homology of the RdRp encoding segment between the two isolates is 93.5% (99.8% deduced amino acid sequence), and 80.4% (89.0% deduced amino acid sequence) for the Sigma B encoding segment.\n",
            " Putative protein functions were determined by BLASTx similarity searches to sequences available on Genbank, revealing putative functions known for other orthoreoviruses. The segments L2, L3, M1, M3, S1, S2 and S3 each contain a single start AUG codon in close proximity to the 5' end. The L1 segment of MAHLV contains two AUG start codons in close proximity to the 5' end, at positions 14 and 19. AGCAUGG) . The open reading frame initiating at position 29 is 2031 nucleotides in length and putatively encodes for an outer capsid protein involved in membrane penetration during infection (muB). The second AUG initiates a 492 nucleotide open reading frame but the deduced amino acid sequence does not match any viral protein of note on Genbank. The deduced Sigma A protein of MAHLV (segment S1) contains the fusogenic orthoreovirus-wide conserved arginine amino acid at position 273. The S4 segment is bicistronic and encodes for a 14 kDa protein similar to p14 membrane fusion protein of Bush viper reovirus and a non-overlapping 18 kDa protein similar to p16 non-structural protein of Baboon orthoreovirus without a known function ( Table 4 ). The isoelectric point of MAHLV p18 is acidic (5.02), similar to that of p16 of Broome virus and Baboon orthoreovirus and contrary to that of other orthoreoviruses. The first ten amino acids in the putative 14 kDa protein of MAHLV are identical to the first ten amino acids in the p13 fusion protein of Broome virus and represent the myristoylation consensus sequence required for fusion activity of the protein. The S4 segment does not encode a cell attachment protein, an observation also characteristic of Broome virus and Baboon orthoreovirus. 1 63.0 54.3 53.9 63.1 63.8 63.3 63.6 64.7 \n",
            " MAHLV replicated efficiently in Vero cell culture, with the inoculum containing a high dose of virus (10 5 TCID 50 /mL) leading to rapid monolayer destruction after inoculation, with a peak in virus RNA (measured by real-time RT-PCR) by day 7, followed by a decrease on day 13. The inoculums containing a lower virus dose (10 4 and 10 3 TCID 50 /mL) resulted in a peak of RNA detection on day 13. All three above-mentioned inoculum doses yielded detectable virus RNA by day 4 after inoculation. The inoculum containing 10 1 TCID 50 /mL virus did not generate detectable viral RNA until day 7, and was still showing an upward trend on day 13 (last sampling day). The virus did not replicate in the insect cells (C6-36) up to day 13, but adaptation to these cells through serial passaging was not attempted.\n",
            " The role of bats in harbouring pathogens of public health and veterinary importance is becoming an increasingly popular topic of research within the field of emerging and zoonotic diseases. The most notable viruses in which natural transmission from bats have been implicated include filoviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, herpesviruses, lyssaviruses and bunyaviruses. The implication of bats in transmission or maintenance of some of these viruses is very circumstantial and often based only on serological evidence. More convincing evidence for others is based on detection of viral nucleic acid and isolation of live virus, although this does not conclusively prove that a vertebrate host is a reservoir. Finding pathogens in bats leads to the questions of how they are transmitted between bats, and from bats to incidental hosts such as humans. One possible transmission mechanism could be bat-associated hematophagous arthropods, such as the bat flies, but migration of parasites between bats is not well understood and would require further entomological investigation to better understand [13] .\n",
            " Two isolates of a novel fusogenic orthoreovirus were cultured and we determined their full genome sequences, which were compared to currently known viruses in the genus. The two isolates are not identical but similar enough to suggest that they are merely two isolates of the same virus. This suggests that there are multiple variants of the virus present in the host population. Members of a species within the Orthoreovirus genus are usually identified by a number of characteristics: amino acid and nucleotide sequence identity, organization of the polycistronic genome segment and host species [19] . For conserved core proteins, an amino acid identity >85% for homologous proteins indicates that two viruses belong to the same species, while identity <65% indicates a possible new species. When comparing the amino acid sequence of more divergent outer capsid proteins, >55% identity indicates one species and <35% indicates different species. Nucleic acid sequence identity of homologous segments of >75% indicates the same species and <60% a new species. The nature of conserved genome segment termini sequences of orthoreoviruses is also useful for virus classification [45] . The divergence of MAHLV sequence from other known orthoreoviruses combined with a unique conserved 5' genome segment end and a unique host species, suggests that this is a new virus species in this genus. Along with Broome virus and Baboon orthoreovirus, MAHLV is the third orthoreovirus that lacks an identified cell attachment protein in the S4 segment. This unique characteristic further strengthens the phylogenetic classification which places these viruses in a separate clade and suggests that entry of these viruses into cells is mediated differently than for other orthoreoviruses.\n",
            " Taking the abovementioned criteria and the sequence characteristics of the novel virus described here into consideration, we propose that Mahlapitsi virus constitutes a new species within the Orthoreovirus genus. To our knowledge this is the first description of an orthoreovirus in Africa with an indirect link to bats. Considering the rich diversity of bat species found on the continent and increased scientific interest in this field, this is unlikely to be the only such virus to be isolated from bat ectoparasites in years to come. However, to our knowledge this is the first orthoreovirus to be isolated from an arthropod host, since all currently known viruses in this genus are associated with vertebrates.\n",
            " MAHLV did not replicate on C6-36 cells in this study but Aedes albopictus, from which the C6-36 cell line is derived, is classified in a completely different dipteran family, the Culicidae, likely pointing to a cell receptor incompatibility. Another possible explanation could be the temperature at which insect cells are cultured compared to mammalian cells, which might be incompatible with this virus.\n",
            " The arthropod-borne nature of MAHLV transmission needs further investigation, especially to establish whether nycteribiid flies are only involved in mechanical or possibly biological transmission, and if the virus is even transmitted to bats. Various other genera in the Reoviridae family contain vector-borne viruses, including Banna virus (Seadornavirus), Colorado tick fever virus (Coltivirus) and Bluetongue virus (Orbivirus). Our isolation of MAHLV from arthropods might direct some attention to the possible role of insects in the transmission of currently known orthoreoviruses, or possibly the presence of other yet unknown viruses in various arthropods. We have no information on the geographical range of MAHLV, but the wide distribution of Rousettus aegyptiacus in Africa and the Middle East [46] , and the strict host preference and specificity of bat flies [13] [14] [15] , dictate that their ranges will overlap.\n",
            " We have no data to suggest that MAHLV has any human health implication, but this warrants further investigation. The virus grows to high titers in Vero E6 cells which suggests that it may infect vertebrates, although growth in in vitro systems cannot be translated directly into replication in a vertebrate host. It is important to note, also, that this was after blind passage and cell culture adaptation (CPE noted after two-three blind passages). Any risk of human infection for now, however, is only likely in individuals who come into close contact with wild Egyptian fruit bats and their ectoparasites. Although highly host-dependent, the bat flies have been noted to leave their bat hosts and crawl on bat researchers (personal observation). Respiratory disease has been noted in humans infected with Melaka, Kampar and Nelson bay orthoreovirus, including limited human-to-human transmission [22, 23, 32, 33] . Thus the potential for MAHLV to infect humans, and spread between humans, cannot be excluded until further investigation is done, especially considering that the virus grows very efficiently on a monkey-derived cell line.\n",
            " In conclusion, we have identified a novel orthoreovirus which we propose should constitute a new species within the genus. Two virus strains were isolated from ectoparasitic bat flies collected from Egyptian fruit bats from a South African cave roost. This represents the first isolation of an orthoreovirus from arthropods and the first African virus in this genus with an indirect link to bats.\n",

            "Title: Highly potent multivalent VHH antibodies against Chikungunya isolated from an alpaca naïve phage display library Open Access Journal of Nanobiotechnology †\n",
            "Body Text: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the causative agent of chikungunya fever (CHIKF), generally causing febrile, arthralgia/arthritis, and rash. The virus is mainly transmitted by the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Human CHIKV infection was first reported in Tanzania in 1953 when the pathogen caused the first major outbreak [1] . In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) first described CHIKF \"A re-emerging disease in Asia\" as a call to increase attention to CHIKV worldwide [2] . In the past decades, CHIKF is prevalent in the Pacific region and Latin America with millions of cases reported over 100 countries [3] [4] [5] . A recent outbreak occurred at the China-Myanmar border in 2019, which was imported from Myanmar to Ruili City, Yunnan Province, China. Being highly infectious, it is considered one of the fastest spreading mosquito-borne diseases following malaria and dengue. As there are no licensed antiviral treatments or vaccines available for the CHIKV infection, early diagnosis is critical. While the mortality rate is low for CHIKV infections, they are likely to be misdiagnosed.\n",
            " CHIKV is an enveloped single-stranded RNA Alphavirus [6] . The mature infectious CHIKV is a ~ 70 nm icosahedral enveloped particle in diameter, composed of transmembrane glycoproteins E1, E2, and E3. E1 and E2 glycoproteins assemble into heterodimers with 80 trimeric spikes on the surface of the virions [7, 8] . E1 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates the fusion of virus and the host cell membrane [9, 10] . E3 is responsible for the folding of the E2-E1 heterodimer but is cleaved during post-translational maturation [11] . E2 is composed of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains located at the center of an N-terminal domain A, the lateral tip of domain B, and at the lateral tip of a C-terminal domain C. Domain A and domain B are considered to be the binding sites of the Mxra8 receptor on the target cell [12] . Because of this structural advantage, CHIKV glycoprotein E2 appears to be immunodominant with multiple identified epitopes which induce neutralizing antibodies and therefore has a higher serodiagnostic potential.\n",
            " Nanobodies are single variable domains on heavy chain (VHH) antibodies of molecular weight ~ 15 kDa that are derived from camelid and cartilaginous heavy-chain only antibodies [13, 14] . As the smallest functional antibody, it is widely studied both in vitro and in vivo. Compared to conventional antibodies, VHHs are highly stable and soluble, easily purified from E. coli, and typically have nanomolar binding affinities [15] [16] [17] . Specifically, the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of nanobodies play a key role in recognizing cavities or hidden epitopes such as the virus-binding site of a cell surface receptor [18] and the active site of an enzyme [19, 20] . Screening of VHH antibodies from the naïve library is the superior option for fast diagnosis and efficient treatment. For example, Dong, et al. [21] and Huo, et al. [22] identified the high-affinity nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 from naïve llama VHH libraries that bind to the S/ RBD protein and block its interaction with ACE2. Similarly, Yan, et al. [23] recognized two human procalcitonin (PCT) nanobodies from the naïve phage display library and successfully applied them to develop a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which showed a linear range of PCT between 10-1000 ng/mL.\n",
            " The current gold standard of CHIKV diagnosis is using virus isolation or virus genome detection assays. Compared to cell culture, fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis is a viable alternative method for viral nucleic acid testing. However, qRT-PCR is problematic due to complicated nucleic acid extraction, which requires highly demanding experimental conditions, is time-consuming, and has an extremely high miss-detection rate [24] . Detection of virions using antibody-based ELISA is a simple and effective approach for identifying and quantitating antigens. To the best of our knowledge, commercial ELISAs are only available for detecting the antibodies for CHIKV (i.e., IgM and IgG). However, commercial rapid ELISA tests for detecting CHIKV antigens are not available. Continued trade and international travel growth may also increase the probability of the emergence of vector viruses. Screening individuals with fever for CHIKV infections using rapid diagnostic tests at airports or customs are warranted. This practice can reduce the risk of importing infections to mainland China.\n",
            " Here, we generated 20 VHH antibodies using a naïve phage display library for binders to the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. Considering the advantages of activity and affinity, Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were selected as the focus of the present study. Our results suggested that both antibodies could bind to CHIKV E2 protein and virus particles as well as recognize different epitopes. In addition, a 100-fold increase in affinity for the E2 glycoprotein was observed when two VHH antibodies were constructed into multivalent formats. This result can be used for diagnostic applications to detect sera binding proteins and/or virions, either as single VHHs or in combination.\n",

Chikungunya/human/China/GD134/2010 (Gen-Bank Accession: HQ846359) was isolated from the serum of an infected female patient at Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Zika/human/China/GD01/2016 (GenBank Accession: KU740184) was isolated from Guangdong inbound passengers. All experiments involving the CHIKV and ZIKA authentic virus were conducted in biosafety level 2 or higher laboratories. Virus virions were inactivated using β-propiolactone (Sigma-Aldrich) with a concentration of 1:2000 at 4 ℃ for 24 h. Complete inactivation of the virus was confirmed by the lack of replication in a Vero infection experiment. Supernatants containing virus particles were concentrated using PEG-it (SBI Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C and resuspended in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, pH7.4) for further use.\n",
            " A VHH phage display library (AlpaLife) of ~ 2 × 10 9 cfu was generated using the phagemid vector pADL-10b. Escherichia coli (E.coli) SS320 cells containing the VHH library were infected with helper phage M13KO7 to produce phages displaying the encoded VHHs as fusion proteins. Biopanning of phages displaying VHHs specific to the Chikungunya/SL-CK1 E2 (Sino Biological) glycoprotein was performed as described previously [25, 26] . After three rounds of panning, 384 individual clones were picked to inoculate 2 × YT (yeast extract tryptone) medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin overnight at 37 °C. The cell-free phage supernatant was detected by phage-ELISA with HRP-conjugated goat anti-M13 IgG antibody (Sino Biological). OD 450 values ≥ 0.5 and P (positive OD 450 )/N (negative OD 450 ) greater than 3 P/N ratios were determined as positive clones. Positive candidates were sequenced (Sangon Biotech) and aligned with CDRs amino acid sequence. A five percent bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative control for each round.\n",

The expressed antibodies can exist as intracellular soluble and active proteins mostly found in the lysate supernatant (Additional file 1: Fig. S1 ). However, Nb-4C1 and Nb-4G10 were aggregated into inclusion bodies in the E.coli cytoplasm (Additional file 1: Fig. S1 ). Soluble VHHs were further purified by cobalt-chelating sepharose columns using 250 mM imidazole for elution. Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE showed the recombinant proteins were detected at the expected apparent molecular weights, which was ~ 28 kDa (Fig. 2b) . To confirm the specificity of binding of the 20 candidate VHH antibodies, CHIKV E2 as coating antigen was carried out by indirect ELISA (Additional file 1: Fig. S2 ). Of these, Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were found to specifically bind with the E2 protein as well as CHIKV virion (Fig. 2d) . Western blot analysis showed that both Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were able to recognize the purified CHIKV virion and the E2 protein (Fig. 2c) . The results suggested that both antibodies recognize linear epitopes on CHIKV E2. Moreover, NTA analysis revealed the particles in the size range characteristic for Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 (< 100 nm) (Fig. 2e) . The morphology of VHHs was further confirmed by TEM (Fig. 2f ) .\n",
            " To validate the binding capabilities of the antibodies targeting the E2 protein, we measured the binding kinetics of antibodies by LSPR. While MoNb-2E8 and MoNb-3C5 have an affinity of 101 nM and 368 nM (Fig. 3a) , they showed a weak affinity with the E2 protein. We also evaluated whether Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 compete with Mxra8-Fc to bind with CHIKV. Both Human Mxra8-Fc and Mouse Mxra8-Fc could non-competitively bind to CHIKV (Fig. 3c) . This would explain that Nb-2E8, Nb-3C5, and Mxra8 interact at different sites with virions and most likely do not compete for the same epitope. Nb-2E8, Nb-3C5, and anti-rabbit serum were used as primary antibodies to detect the expression of the viral E2 protein in Vero cells at 72 h post-infection. Figure 3b showed that specific green and red fluorescence were observed in the virus-infected cells, but not in virusuninfected cells. Further confirmation of the binding specificity of the VHHs was accomplished by flow cytometry analysis of infected cells labeled with Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 (Fig. 3d) . Blue boxes, the proportion of cells in which the fluorescence value exceeded the gating threshold. Quantifications presented in ratios of fluorescencepositive cells to the total number of cells, revealed that the FITC-positive values of CHIKV infected cells were visibly higher than ZIKA infected cells (P < 0.05).\n",
            " To further improve the affinity of VHH antibodies against CHIKV E2, Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were fused to an Fc domain of IgG1 to generate multivalent fusion proteins and obtain milligram quantities of highly pure (> 95%) recombinant proteins (Fig. 4a, 4b , and Additional file 2: Table S3 ). BiNb-2E8, BiNb-3C5, TriNb-2E8, and TriNb-3C5 showed high binding affinities to CHIKV E2 with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of 2.59, 20.70, 4.52, and 10.40, respectively (Fig. 3a) . Cytofluorimetric quantification of BiNb-2E8 stained cells to the total number of cells was 95.81% and 95.20% for BiNb-3C5 (Additional file 1: Fig. S3 ).\n",
            " We developed a sandwich ELISA protocol, in which purified bivalent antibodies are used as the capture and different bivalent antibodies are used for detection, to quantify relative antigen response levels. From 4 independent experiments, the linear equation of Y = 6.908e-004 X + 0.7684 (r = 0.9864, P < 0.0001) was found to be the optimal linear fit, which demonstrated good linearity over the concentration range (5-1250 ng/mL) (Fig. 4c) . The BiNb-2E8 was combined as capture and the HRP-labelled BiNb-3C5 as detection to reveal a combination with good performance.\n",
            " To establish a baseline for the evaluation of the E2 antigen capture test, 20 CHIKV seronegative samples were analyzed. The cut-off was defined as the mean OD 450 value of the negative controls + 3SD: 0.0696 + (3 × 0.0128) = 0.108. Hence, sera samples giving OD 450 values higher than 0.108 were recorded as positive, and negative when OD 450 values were lower than 0.108. By this criterion, all 15 serum of patients infected with CHIKV had OD values greater than that of the cut-off value, which was judged as positive. Also, the difference between CHIKV seronegative and seropositive samples was significant s (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4d) . Therefore, the sandwich ELISA established in this study can be used in the early diagnosis of CHIKV viral infection.\n",
            " To characterize specific linear epitopes of the CHIKV E2 protein, 68 peptides with an offset of ten amino acids were used to assess responses (Additional file 2: Table S4 ). As shown in Fig. 5b , P61-GEEPNYQEEW and P10-LKIQVSLQIG strongly reacted with Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5, which correspond to the amino acid residues 331 to 340 and 46 to 55 of CHIKV E2 domain C and A, respectively (Fig. 5a) . Comparison of epitopes of the Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 with sequences from representative strains of each CHIKV genotype (SL-CK1, BR33, CU-Chik683, and Ross: East, Central, and South African (ECSA); RSU1: Asian; Senegal: West African) (Fig. 5c) . Of note is that the Nb-3C5 recognized epitope is highly conserved across the six-representative CHIKV genotypes. to map the binding of antibodies to the E2 protein. Like peptide-based ELISA, the formation of complex demonstrates Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 bind different epitopes on E2 (Fig. 5d) . In the complex, residues L98, G99, W100, T101, and L108 from the CDR3 loop of Nb-2E8 made contacts with the P61epitopes of E2. The CDR1 and CDR3 regions of Nb-3C5 have contributed to the P10 epitopes of domain C.\n",
            " Nanobody opens important possibilities for biomedical applications, but so far, most have been generated by immunized Camelidae, which is time-consuming and expensive for laboratories. Naïve phage display library, a technique for obtaining genetically engineered nanobodies against an antigen without immunization [31] , allowed the isolation of antibodies against autoantigens, nonimmunogenic, or toxic antigens. High-affinity antibodies can be obtained in a short time when the library capacity is sufficiently large. VHH, also namely nanobody, is tenfold smaller than conventional antibodies with unique advantages [32] . As a result of its small size and stability, it is easily incorporated into the body's natural metabolic pathways. More importantly, VHH domains have longer complementary antigen-binding regions CDR3, providing greater antigen-binding capacity, and the affinity of nanobodies can be further improved by genetic engineering techniques [33] . In this study, we performed genetically engineered VHH antibodies targeting of CHIKV by using a phage display technique based on a naïve antibody library derived from 103 healthy adult alpaca lymphocytes with a capacity of 2 × 10 9 cfu, which was able to screen for specific binding VHH antibodies. A total of 20 VHH sequences specifically binding to CHIKV E2 were obtained, including CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. The amino acid sequence length of the CDR3 region varies from 17 to 20, with 85% of the sequences greater than 17 amino acids, indicating typical characteristics of a nanobody. In framework region 2 (FR2), the high stability and solubility of VHH was attributed to the typical substitutions of hydrophobic residues. Altogether, the VHH antibody was a convenient monovalent scaffold, with the single-chain easily expressed in E. coli. The pET-SUMO expression system, which combines the pET plasmid with a SUMO partner linking the target gene to SUMO via a homologous recombination cloning strategy, is efficiently and stably expressed under the control of a strong T7 promoter [34] . The SUMO protein was an ideal candidate tag for enhancing the expression, folding, and stability of proteins [35, 36] , especially for heterologous proteins like antibody fragments [37] . Several studies have reported that recombinant proteins have been efficiently produced using the SUMO fusing system in E. coli [38] [39] [40] . The results from this study agree with the previous studies. VHH antibodies were secreted to the culture medium in a soluble form. An N-terminal 6 × His Tag was added to the expression vector to aid purification and, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a single band at approximately 28 kDa. However, two VHHs Nb-4C1 and Nb-4G10 were expressed in E. coli and refolded from inclusion bodies. We speculated that it can potentially be associated with VHH sequences.\n",
            " For purified VHH antibodies, following identification by ELISA, western blot, and IFA-mediated overlap experiment, Nb-2E8, and Nb-3C5, we have chosen for further validation. SPR technology is widely known as a golden standard for capturing antibody-antigen interactions [41, 42] . To determine the kinetic rate and affinity constants, binding analysis of E2 and monovalent antibodies were carried out by LSPR. LSPR results demonstrated that the binding affinity of MoNb-2E8 and MoNb-3C5 is relatively low. Recombinant fusions of monovalent antibodies are limited by weak binding affinity due to the lack of multivalent affinity benefits, poor production capacity, and potential immunogenicity [43] [44] [45] . To further improve the affinity of VHHs against CHIKV E2, homodimer (BiNb-2E8, BiNb-3C5) and homo-trimer (TriNb-2E8, TriNb-3C5) were fused to an Fc domain of IgG1 to generate multivalent fusion proteins. We surprisingly found that compared with the corresponding monovalent antibodies, both homo-dimer and homo-trimer showed a 100-fold enhancement towards the E2 protein. Among them, BiNb-2E8 was confirmed by LSPR analysis, with a binding affinity of ~ 2.59 nM. Developing high affinity and specific antibodies for capturing viral antigens is crucial for any point-of-care testing (POCT) such as ELISA to be successful. Thus, we capitalize on the strengths of the selected VHH antibodies to establish a rapid, convenient, and reliable screening test.\n",
            " A major advantage of the ELISA method is that it can detect viruses at a concentration of 1-10 µg/ml and require few antibodies [46] . Traditional antibodies considered for developing ELISA have been polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. However, these highly specific antibodies are cost-effective and have poor stability under adverse environmental conditions [47] . Nanobodies are powerful tools for a wide application in molecular biology, providing high affinity and antigen specificity. In this study, we prepare specific multivalent antibodies against the E2 protein and develop a double-antibody sandwich ELISA for the detection of antigen quality using BiNb-2E8 as capture antibodies and BiNb-3C5 as the detection antibodies. A good linear correlation was achieved in the 5-1000 ng/mL range. ELISA results showed that patients with CHIKV had significantly higher serum E2 levels than CHIKV seronegative (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the best choice for coated antibodies is to recognize only a single antigenic determinant [48] [49] [50] . Two types of diagnostic and protective antigens, ZIKA and SARS-CoV-2, were tested by indirect ELISA. Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were found to have no binding activity to react with the ZIKA and SARS-CoV-2 proteins without any dose-dependent manner. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis of the two VHHs of Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 positively stains CHIKVinfected cells but was negative on ZIKA-infected cells. Overall, Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 were specific for CHIKV and had no cross-reactivity with ZIKA and SARS-CoV-2. These findings indicated that the ELISA protocol could be performed in any laboratory and served as the foundation of an inexpensive tool for the early diagnosis of CHIKV.\n",
            " An understanding of the interaction between the antibody and its targeted antigen, and knowing the epitopes, are critical for developing epitope-based diagnostic reagents. The epitopes recognized by the VHHs were identified by peptide-based ELISA, and the epitopes sites were located. Previous studies have reported that several monoclonal antibodies targeting the structure of the domain A and B could block fusion and inhibit interaction with cellular receptors [8, 51] . Epitope mapping revealed that Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 bound the different linear epitopes distributed in domain C and domain A, respectively. In particular, the P10-46 \"LKIQVSLQIG\" 55 has not been reported. But we had previously predicted that the peptide \"QVSLQIGIK\" was the immunodominant B-and T-cell epitope using in silico techniques (unpublished data). Several studies suggested that the P61-301 \"GEEP-NYQEEW\" 310 was found to be B-cell epitopes shared by humans and mice [52, 53] . Unfortunately, the selected two VHH antibodies that focus on the domains of the target linear epitopes are non-neutralizing. The main neutralization sites on the CHIKV E2 protein are likely to be available in a conformation-dependent manner, rather than as linear epitopes.\n",
            " Based on sequence alignment analysis, the P10 was completely conserved among all CHIKV genotype strains analyzed here, indicating that Nb-3C5 is potentially capable of recognizing three CHIKV genotypes (ECSA, Asian, and West African). It also found that the P61 epitope sequence in the West African lineage CHIKV strain had two single two amino acid differences from the other genotypes. This may limit the potential diagnostic applications of Nb-2E8 in countries where West African lineage strains of the virus circulate. However, all epitopes had significant amino acid mutations across other alphaviruses (Mayaro virus, O'nyong'nyong virus, Semliki Forest virus, Ross River virus, Sindbis virus, etc.). These features enable the differential diagnosis of CHIKV. Taken together, these VHH antibodies, Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5, specifically recognize different epitopes of the CHIKV E2 protein, which are the optimal pair of antibodies for the development of a double-antibody sandwich ELISA.\n",
            " There are several potential limitations to the study. First, our study is only focused on highly potent antibodies against CHIKV. Further studies are needed to demonstrate other VHH antibodies could interact with the E2 protein and to evaluate the diagnostic or treatment merit of specific antibodies. Second, the present study illustrates a strategy to mine the valuable VHH antibodies by naïve phage display library. The results support the feasibility of VHHs as a rapid diagnostic tool. However, the diagnostic accuracy parameters and procedures in this study have not been directly optimized. To establish a standardized CHIKV diagnostic process, the optimization of antibody reagents is required. Third, the binding site prediction of nanobody-E2 complex relies on peptide-ELISA and homology-modeling applications, which lacked X-ray diffraction (XRD) or cryoelectronic microscopy to investigate the crystal structure parameters.\n",
            " In summary, we developed VHH antibodies from a naïve phage display library that addresses the specific needs of CHIKV serodiagnosis. The selected antibodies of Nb-2E8 and Nb-3C5 could bind the CHIKV E2 protein with high specificity and affinity in a multivalent platform. These results suggest that the selected antibodies are used for diagnostic applications to detect sera binding protein and/or virions, either as single VHHs or in combination.\n",

            "Body Text: Viruses are not only notorious for their pathological nature and associated diseases, but also for their role as model systems for studying molecular events and identifying critical cellular machineries. Previous investigations have provided insights into the structure, function, and protein interactions of individual viral proteins. More significantly, these studies have partially elucidated the associated positive and negative gene regulation, chaperone activity, repressor-operator interactions, DNA replication, transcriptional elongation and termination, RNA splicing, immune signaling, and oncogenic transformation [1] . However, only a limited number of viral proteins have been extensively studied to date. A large body of information on viruses and virus-host interactions remains untapped. The analysis of such data will increase our understanding of fundamental biological processes.\n",
            " Proteomics is an emerging high-throughput technology †Contributed equally to this work *Corresponding author (email: xia-zhao@126.com; hcanhua@hotmail.com) that complements genomics exploration to evaluate protein-protein interactions and cellular alterations on a global scale, allowing the discovery of previously unannotated connections. Progress in mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategies not only revolutionized the investigation of specific proteins, but also enabled global protein expression analysis [2, 3] . However, proteome research is still somewhat held back by the intrinsically complicated nature of proteins, the heterogeneity in subcellular location of proteins, and the variable sensitivity in identifying less abundant proteins in the presence of highly abundant proteins [4, 5] . Recent advances in comparative proteomics and quantitative proteomics have addressed some of these drawbacks and have provided seminal weapons for protein investigation.\n",
            " The application of proteomics strategies in viral research has, for some time, attracted increasing attention worldwide. Proteomic studies of the host upon viral infection have delineated the molecular interactions between the virus and the host, thus providing hints for the detection, diagnosis, and therapeutics of infectious diseases. In this review, we have divided viral proteomics into virion proteomics and host-virus interactions. We have also revisited some of the pros and cons of the available proteomics methods in virus investigations.\n",
            " Viruses evolved to adapt to harsh host environments by packaging their genetic material with positively charged capsid proteins and, under some circumstances, an additional tegument layer and extra membrane coats. While capsids consist of protein subunits encoded by viral genomes, envelopes comprise not only viral proteins, but also host cell proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Viruses orchestrate these molecular compositions to complete a wide spectrum of functions during infection, replication, and propagation, including assembly, exit, transmission, attachment, penetration, and uncoating [6] . Thus, viral protein composition analysis is useful for elucidating virus structure and for determining modification of virus protein expression during attachment and entry of the virus into host cells.\n",
            " Compared with eukaryotic cell proteomes, virus proteomes are simple and highly conserved. However, relatively few virion proteomes have been characterized to date. Conventionally, determining the global protein composition of a specific virus particle involves pure virus preparation, detergent denaturation, electrophoretic separation, and identification of protein bands by immunoblotting or by se-quencing with Edman degradation [7] . In recent years, new approaches that utilize a combination of techniques have provided potent tools for virion research. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) coupled with identification of protein spots using mass spectrometry, also termed \"the shotgun approach\", has generated robust amounts of virus protein information. Another novel viral proteomics strategy is based on the analysis of differential enzymatic digestions of whole virions, or solubilized and deconvoluted virion proteins. The protein extracts thus obtained are fragmented into peptides that are further separated by 1D or multidimensional liquid chromatography (LC), and analyzed by MS. Both technologies require subsequent database search algorithms to define peptide fragmentation patterns and the corresponding proteins, and require specialized bioinformatics analysis. These techniques have been confirmed to be useful for the exploration of virion proteomes (Table 1 ).\n",
            " To date, a few proteomic studies have attempted to analyze virions from non-enveloped eukaryotic viruses, the most studied of which is adenovirus. In 2002, one group employed LC-MS/MS with both one-dimensional and twodimensional chromatographic separations to characterize the protein complement of adenovirus type 5 virions. Eleven protein species were identified from 154 peptides, and all of the major viral proteins were found; however, the 23-kD viral protease was detected only after 2D separation. The researchers concluded that LC-MS/MS was a powerful tool for identifying whole virion proteins that are present at copy numbers of 10 or more [8] .\n",
            " Chronologically, the first proteome of a DNA virus particle to be sequenced was an ictalurid fish herpes virus, the channel catfish virus, in 1995. Purified virions were solubilized with NP-40, separated by gel electrophoresis, electroblotted, and the bands digested with different proteases including trypsin, Lys-C, Arg-C, or glu-C to generate a broad spectrum of peptide fragments. The fragments were subsequently analyzed using MALDI-MS. The peptide mass fingerprint was used to search the Swiss-Prot database, and a total of 16 primary structural proteins, including mature capsid proteins, protein kinases, C3HC4 zinc-binding protein, and actin were identified [9] . More importantly, the above-mentioned combined strategy of MS and sequence database searching has now become widely applied for the analysis of in the proteomes of such DNA virions as poxviruses and herpes viruses. With regard to poxviruses, although the complete genomic sequences of most poxviruses have been available for some time, only a limited number of studies have attempted to comprehensively profile the protein composition of poxvirus virions [25] . Early proteomics studies attempted to analyze the protein composition of purified vaccinia virus (VV). However, they were unable to perform a complete structural analysis of all the protein components of the virions, probably because the limited availability of advanced purification methodologies and the limitations of the technologies available for protein identification at the time. Recently, three different groups with different approaches, instruments, and digestion protocols reported the comprehensive structural analysis of the protein composition of the infectious mature virion of VV [10] [11] [12] . For instance, Resch et al. [10] detected 80 vaccinia virus-encoded proteins, representing 37% of the 218 genes annotated in the complete genome sequence, using denaturation with SDS or urea, fractionation with solid-phase extraction columns, and analysis by LC-ESI-LTQ Fourier transform MS. Among them were 13 proteins were not previously described as being part of the virion. H5, F8, E3, E6, and A6 were not previously reported as being virion-associated proteins, while N1, C22, A11, A19, M1, A50, E9, and F4 had been described as absent or unlikely to be associated with the virion.\n",
            " The growing number of studies investigating herpes viruses has also resulted in a more comprehensive understanding of the structure of the herpes virion, as well as the function of each viral protein [26] . Herpes viruses investigated by proteomics strategies include human cytomegalovirus (CMV) (HCMV) [13] and murine cytomegalovirus of the beta herpesviruses [14] , Epstein-Barr (EB) virus (EBV) [17] , Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) [16, 27, 28] , rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) [17] , and murine gamma herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) of the gamma herpesviruses [29] . However, no virion proteomics studies of alpha herpesviruses have yet been documented, including the intensively studied herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).\n",
            " Other enveloped DNA viruses have been studied using an integrated proteomics strategy, for example, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). WSSV is a double-stranded DNA virus that contains a 305-kb circular DNA, which putatively encodes 181 ORFs. In 2002, Huang et al. [18] separated the purified WSSV virions by SDS-PAGE, excised 24 protein bands, and subjected them to in-gel trypsin digestion, MALDI-TOF, and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Eighteen proteins corresponding to ORFs of the WSSV genome were identified, among which were 14 proteins of unknown functions. Temporal analysis implied that all the genes were transcribed in the late stage of WSSV infection, except for vp121. Of the 14 newly-identified proteins, VP466 was further characterized as a novel envelope protein. More recent research described the application of the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ™) approach to define the location of proteins in WSSV [19] . Li et al. [19] reported 45 viral proteins, including 13 novel proteins associated with the virion. In particular, they identified 23 envelope proteins and six nucleocapsid proteins, including 12 novel envelopes and two novel nucleocapsid proteins. This study exemplifies the successful application of quantitation techniques to investigate the localization of virion proteins.\n",
            " Unlike the wide spectrum of proteomics research of virions of DNA viruses, only a limited number of proteomic studies have been carried out on RNA viruses, primarily because of their simpler structures and the fewer numbers of proteins in RNA virions. Therefore, high-throughput proteomics approaches to investigate RNA virion proteomes have seemed unnecessary. Currently, two types of enveloped RNA viruses have been intensively analyzed: severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated corona virus (SARS-CoV) and HIV-1.\n",
            " In 2004, Zeng et al. [20] utilized one-dimensional electrophoresis followed by ESI MS/MS identification or a shotgun strategy with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-ESI MS/MS to identify the structural proteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) isolated from Vero E6 cells infected with the BJ-01 strain of the virus. All four of the predicted structural proteins (nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E)) were identified, and a novel phosphorylated site of the M protein was revealed. This combination of gel-based and non-gel approaches provides a fast and complimentary tool, which can be expected to be widely applied in the analysis of other viruses. An-other comprehensive proteomic analysis on the structural proteins of SARS-CoV uncovered three of the structural proteins (S, N, and M). Four glycosylation sites of the S protein were discovered by comparing the mass spectra before and after deglycosylation of the peptides with PNGase F digestion. Surprisingly, a number of shorter isoforms of the N protein were noted by SDS-PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry characterization [30] . This study suggested that the identification of virus-specific proteins by MS could be effectively employed as a diagnostic method for rapid screening of highly infectious viruses, virus-infected cells, or even biofluids containing viruses.\n",
            " HIV jeopardizes the host immune system by specifically attacking macrophages and CD4 + T cells, and multiple groups have defined a robust number of host cell proteins in HIV virions. One group used LC MS/MS on whole virions to gain an overview of the HIV-1 proteome. All known viral and host-cellular proteins, as well as novel components of HIV-1, were identified and further confirmed by traditional biochemical methods [21] . In another study, highly purified HIV-1 virions produced from human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were analyzed [22] . Liquid chromatography-linked tandem mass spectrometry identified a plethora of cellular proteins, including 33 previously annotated proteins in HIV-1 preparations from other cell types. These proteins were involved in such cellular structures and functions as the cytoskeleton, adhesion, signaling, intracellular trafficking, chaperoning, metabolism, ubiquitin/proteasome, and immune response systems. Other identified proteins included annexins, annexin-binding proteins, Rab proteins, and proteins involved in membrane organization, vesicular trafficking, and late endosomal function, Apolipoprotein E, which participates in cholesterol transport, immunoregulation, and modulation of cell growth and differentiation, was also identified. These results provide significant leads for follow-up experiments on HIV-1 assembly, infection, and pathogenesis.\n",
            " Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant and diverse form of life and have indispensable roles in the microbial world. A series of studies have examined the structural proteomes of bacteriophages. Savalia et al. [31] utilized liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to analyze the virion proteins of phiEco32, a novel Escherichia coli bacteriophage. Two phiEco32-encoded proteins that interact with the host RNA polymerase were defined. One is an ECF family σ factor that might be responsible for the transcription of certain viral genes, and the other is a novel RNA polymerase-binding protein and transcription. Roberts et al. [32] explored the proteome of coliphage T1 using isoelectric focusing to separate the components of the virion, followed by MALDI-TOF. T1 was expected to consist of 13−15 structural proteins in the mature virion. Correspondingly, the 2DE analysis of the T1 virion performed in the same study resolved 15 proteins. Subsequent mass spectrometry revealed four abundantly expressed proteins: the major tail protein (gp41), a major capsid component (gp49), the major head subunit (gp47), and a protein associated with the major head subunit (gp48) [10] . In 2006, Naryshkina et al. [33] determined the sequence of the 152372 bp genome of pYS40, a lytic tailed bacteriophage of Thermus thermophilus. pYS40 contains 170 putative ORFs and three tRNA genes. Functions for a quarter of the pYS40 gene products were putatively attributed, based on similarity to proteins of known function from diverse phages and bacteria. A cluster of proteins was identified as being involved in nucleotide salvage, such as flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase, thymidylate kinase, ribonucleotide reductase, and deoxycytidylate deaminase. Others were involved in DNA replication, such as DNA primase, helicase, type A DNA polymerase. The increasing number of such studies will provide invaluable knowledge complementing the annotation of phage genomes and allowing for comparative genomics studies.\n",
            " Collectively, although a growing number of eukaryotic viruses and phages have been sequenced, only a small proportion of them have been characterized at the protein level. The identification of previously unknown gene products is important for our understanding of virion structures, and more importantly, is pivotal to the investigation of virus and host interaction. In addition, the development of virion proteomics might also provide potent tools for diagnosis, and could generate novel insights into the therapeutics of virus-induced infectious diseases.\n",
            " Host-virus interactions have been explored ever since the discovery of viruses in 1898, when Martinus Beijerinck described tobacco mosaic virus [34] . However, only after the invention of the electron microscope, protein biochemistry, and ultimately, nucleic acid sequencing, has the systematic molecular definition of these interactions become achievable. Many studies have focused on the interaction of viral proteins with viral and host cellular proteins (interactomics) and on alterations in cellular protein abundance during infection. Despite of the documentation of many thousands of protein-protein interactions between virus and human proteins, we are still far from a complete comprehension of the different kinds of virus biology. Thus, novel technology suitable for molecular biology is vital for uncovering the complexities of each infection process. The most frequently used techniques for interactomics include yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening and co-immunoprecipitation of interacting proteins, followed by MS analysis. In particular, the Y2H method can be applied to highthroughput screening of interactions between any two pro-teins. As for host cell proteomics, 2DE coupled with MS and stable isotope labeling methods have been successfully applied (Table 2) .\n",
            " The most widely applied methods to study protein-protein interactions on a proteome-wide scale include Y2H screening and tagged protein immunoprecipitation, coupled with protein identification with MS. While the Y2H method fa-cilitates the mapping of binary or pair-wise interactions, affinity capturing approaches, followed by MS-based protein identification methodologies, enable the investigation of protein interaction complexes comprising more than two molecules ( Figure 1 ).\n",
            " The Y2H system was first introduced by Fields and Song [35] in 1989, and delineates binary physical interactions between proteins. The major advantages of the Y2H system are the facts that it allows one bait to be matched against multiple preys, and that both homo-and heterodimeric interactions can be detected. Moreover, the screens are largely independent of the optimal experimental conditions compared with affinity purification research, because both bait and prey libraries are expressed at comparable levels. Although this may generate nonphysiological protein levels, the increased expression levels might also enhance the sensitivity of the system [36] . Despite its strengths, the Y2H system is defective in its capacity for detecting interactions. On the one hand, it cannot detect cooperative interactions between more than two proteins because of the binary nature of the technique. On the other hand, the interaction occurs in the nucleus, which poses problems for the expression of integral membrane proteins. In addition, certain proteins and transcription factors might independently enable the transcription of the reporter. In addition, ectopically expressed proteins sometimes evade post-translational modification (PTM), thereby ruling out dynamic, PTM-dependent, binary interactions [37] .\n",
            " The Y2H system has been widely applied in the study of global proteome interaction of various viruses. The most recent virus interaction screening database includes T7 bacteriophage, VV, and KSHV & varicella-zoster virus. As early as 1996, Bartel et al. [38] used the yeast two-hybrid system on a genome-wide scale to identify 25 interactions among the proteins of Escherichia coli and bacteriophage T7. Among these, a set of six interactions connected proteins that function in DNA replication and DNA packaging. Several of the interactions reflect intramolecular associations of different domains of the same polypeptide, suggesting an important role of the two-hybrid assay in the analysis of protein folding. McCraith et al. [39] performed a comprehensive two-hybrid analysis to detect interactions among proteins of vaccinia virus. They constructed an array of yeast transformants that comprised each of the 266 putative viral ORFs as Gal4 activation domain hybrid proteins. The array was individually mated to transformants containing each ORF as a Gal4-DNA-binding domain hybrid. Diploids expressing the two-hybrid reporter genes were defined. Of the 70000 combinations, 37 protein-protein interactions were found, including 28 that were previously unannotated. The interacting proteins could be functionally categorized into DNA replication, transcription, virion structure and morphogenesis, and virus-host interactions. Another study investigated intraviral protein interactions in herpes viral proteins, KSHV, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Eightynine ORFs from the KHSV genome were tested for 12000 viral protein interactions, leading to the detection of 123 nonredundant interacting protein pairs. Of the 69 ORFs in VZV and 10000 tested bait-prey pairs, 173 nonredundant intraviral protein interactions were found. A database of all predicted viral intraprotein interactions and previously established viral protein-human cellular protein interactions has been set up. This database facilitated the prediction of 20 interactions between eight KSHV and 20 human proteins [28] . These studies illustrate that the global yeast two-hybrid screening of protein-protein interactions can be applied to the analysis of emerging, more complex, genomes.\n",
            " In 2004, Dziembowski et al. [40] documented the tandem affinity purification (TAP) procedure, which employs a fusion tag consisting of two sites separated by a protease cleavable spacer. This technology has been applied in a variety of virus research. Jorba et al. [41] purified the intracellular complexes formed by the influenza polymerase in human cells by the TAP approach. The purified complexes contained the heterotrimeric polymerase and a series of associated proteins that were not apparent in purifications of control untagged polymerase. Further identification of influenza polymerase-associated proteins was achieved by MALDI-MS and validated by Western blotting. The roles of these proteins in influenza infection were substantiated by colocalization with virus ribonucleoproteins in infected human cells. The majority of the associated human factors were nuclear proteins involved in cellular RNA synthesis, modification, and nucleocytoplasmic export, except for cytosolic proteins involved in translation and transport. The interactions annotated in this proteomic research suggest a significant role for the influenza polymerase in the infection cycle other than in RNA replication and transcription. In research by Mayer et al. [42] , strep-tagged viral nucleoprotein (NP-Strep) bait and TAP-tagged polymerase subunit bait (TAP tag) were applied to explore the interacting proteins of influenza A viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP). Forty-one proteins were identified using NP-Strep bait, and four proteins were found using TAP-tagged bait. These included importin-β3 and PARP-1, the two polymerase-associated factors. These studies proved the effectiveness of TAP purification in protein interaction analysis. However, the application of this technology is limited because of its relatively low throughput compared with other methods.\n",
            " While the Y2H method serves as the initial identification of protein-protein interactions, further confirmation of the interaction requires other pull-down assays. These methods involve the expression of one or both of the proteins in another organism, usually E. coli, and the addition of affinity tags such as His6 and GST to the N-or C-terminus of the expressed proteins to improve purification and identification. If only one of the proteins is expressed recombinantly, a native source of the second partner must be available [37] . Several studies have used this method to investigate protein-protein interactions. A recent report unraveled the expression of pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1)/ securin in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver diseases using glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments [43] . They concluded that the interaction between PTTG1 and the Skp1-Cul1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex (SCF) was partially disrupted, possibly through a mechanism involving protein-protein interactions of HBx with PTTG1 and/or SCF. Thus, pull-down experiments can validate Y2H interaction results in virus research. This strategy is potentially useful for the definition of binding partners that conduct signals, as well as for interactions that occur when the host and the virus fuse [26] .\n",
            " Although the Y2H system provides a high-throughput tool for protein-protein interaction screen, it cannot monitor the dynamic interactions that occur upon virus infection. One group constructed a modified immunoprecipitation protocol to unravel the dynamic viral protein interaction using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged virus [44] . This protocol involved tagging the virus with GFP-encoded proteins, visualizing the proteins' locations in the host cell at distinct infection stages, isolating interacting proteins using GFP affinity columns, and protein validation by MS. This study examined the interaction of the nsP3 protein of αvirus, Sindbis, with mammalian proteins at different times during infection. They demonstrated that a host factor was recruited to nsP3-containing complexes in a time-dependent fashion. This process was concomitant with a specific early and continuous recruitment of G3BP, a nuclear transport factor, and a subsequent recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins. These conclusions not only confirmed that Sindbis virus infection can modify RNA transport, but more significantly, revealed the utility of novel high-throughput methodologies to verify protein-protein interactions in host cells infected by viruses.\n",
            " The previously described technologies only offer a descriptive view of protein-protein interactions. They cannot characterize the physiological significance of these interactions, which are often elucidated by mutations or other functional experiments. In recent years, the development of RNAibased methods for protein knockdown in mammalian cells has allowed unparalleled flexibility in the study of protein function. Large siRNA libraries are now available that allow the knockdown of all proteins known to be encoded by the human genome. These libraries have been used to provide mechanistic explanations by depleting RNAs of defined genes. Together with bioinformatics analysis, this approach has played a pivotal role in identifying host factors required for such viruses as HIV, flaviviruses, and the H1N1 virus. Thus, RNAi screens and protein interaction screens perfectly complement protein-protein interaction screens [45] . For example, Brass et al. [46] and Konig et al. [47] conducted two independent investigations that systematically screened for human genes indispensable for HIV infection and replication. They identified 284 and 295 required cell factors, respectively, with an overlap of 13 genes. Integration of RNAi data and protein interaction data generated a host-pathogen interaction network comprising 213 functionally validated and 169 predicted HIV host cellular nodes. These nodes were cross-linked via 2291 binary protein interactions and 318 interactions to HIV-encoded proteins. This RNAi analysis revealed the biological context through phenotypes provided simultaneous mechanistic explanations for these phenotypes.\n",
            " The combination of LC-MS and sequence database searching has been successfully applied to the analysis of global protein expression. The major methods used for protein expression analysis include 2DE-based separation of proteins and stable isotope labeling techniques (Figure 2 ).\n",
            " Currently, protein isolation by 2DE coupled with MS-based analysis of differentially expressed spots, is the most widely utilized among a wide spectrum of protein-expression analysis technologies, primarily because of its simplicity and wide applicability. Viruses studied by this approach comprise HBV, EBV, SARS-CoV, HCV, and HIV-1. In 2008, Tong et al. [48] successfully utilized 2-DE and MS/MS analysis to compare and identify differentially expressed proteins between an HBV-producing cell line, HepG2.2.15, and its parental cell line, HepG2, to determine the effects of HBV replication on host cell-protein expression. Sixty-two spots were positively identified by MS/MS analysis. Cluster and metabolic/signaling pathway analysis divided the proteins into three groups: retinol metabolism pathway, calcium ion-binding proteins, and proteins associated with protein degradation pathways. This study provided novel insights into the mechanisms underlying HBV-host cell interactions and the development of HCC [11] . In another study, 2D-GE-MALDI-TOF-MS was applied to clinical HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. One hundred protein spots, corresponding to 80 distinct gene products, were identified. Among these 100 proteins, proliferating cell antigen and stathmin 1 were further corroborated by Western blotting. In an attempt to profile EBV-induced cellular proteome alterations, EBV transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were used as a model system to identify the proteins essential for the im- In the Y2H method, two plasmids including a bait-encoding protein fused to the C-terminus of a transcription factor BD (binding domain) and a prey-encoding protein fused to an AD (activation domain) are constructed. Subsequently, the plasmids are introduced into a suitable yeast strain, and if the two proteins physically interact with one another, the BD and AD are brought together to reconstitute an active transcription factor. This active transcription factor binds to upstream specific activation sequences in the reporter gene promoter to activate expression. By measuring the expression of a reporter gene, the interaction between the proteins can be examined. In the TAP immunoprecipitation method, a fusion tag comprising two sites, one protein A IgG-binding domain and one CBP tag, separated by a spacer containing the specific recognition site for the TEV protease, is expressed in the target cell. The purification steps for interacting proteins are summarized in the right picture. AD, activation domain; BD, DNA-binding domain; CBP, calmodulin-binding peptide; TAP, tandem affinity purification; TEV, tobacco etch virus. mortalization process. By surveying the differential protein expression profile between pre-and post-immortal cells, this study ultimately identified 20 proteins from 32 spots. Upregulated proteins included proliferating cell nuclear antigen, nucleoside diphosphate kinase-A, and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase. Downregulated proteins included ubiquitin ligase N and stathmin [49] . Coiras et al. [50] examined the impact of the HIV-I tat protein on Jurkat T cells using 2-D DIGE followed by MS analysis. This study noted downregulation of several cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin, β-tubulin, and annexin II, as well as gelsolin, cofilin, and the Rac/Rho-GDI complex. This expression pattern change could account for the survival of long-term reservoirs of HIV-infected CD4 + T cells responsible for continuous viral production.\n",
            " The recently established quantitative proteomic technology, SILAC, has shown great potential in protein expression profiling. SILAC involves a straightforward metabolic labeling method, where the cells are grown in medium containing amino acids with stable nonabundant isotopes (e.g., 15 N, 13 C and 2 D) and compared with the cells grown in medium containing stable abundant isotopes ( 14 N, 12 C and 1 H). Protein abundance is calculated as the ratios of the peak intensity of the fragment ions from the labeled versus the unlabeled peptides, thus constituting an ideal tool for protein expression analysis upon viral infection [51] . Mannova et al. [52] used 2DE followed by mass spectrometry or SILAC combined with one-dimensional electrophoresis separation and mass spectrometry to quantify the modification of the host lipid raft proteome upon HCV infection. While the 2DE and mass spectrometry strategy identified approximately 100 protein spots, the number of individual proteins characterized by the SILAC approach totaled 1036. Many of these proteins were involved in vesicular and protein trafficking and cell signaling. Using small interfering RNAs modulating small GTPases Cdc42 and RhoA, this study noticed an increase in HCV replication. On the other hand, decreased syntaxin 7 expression led to decreased replication of HCV. This proteomics study indicated that protein subcellular relocalization occurs in HCV-containing cells, which can directly influence HCV replication. Recently, Zhang et al. [53] developed a cell line expressing a SARS-CoV subgenomic replicon and used it to screen inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication. The protein profiles of the SARS-CoV replicon cells and parental BHK21 cells were compared by SILAC coupled with mass spectrometry to identify the host proteins essential for SARS-CoV RNA replication. Among the 1081 host proteins quantified, 74 had significantly altered levels of expression. Of these, BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), a multifunctional molecule proved to participate in cell survival, cellular stress response, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, was subjected to further functional studies. The results indicated that inhibition of BAG3 expression by RNA interference led to significant suppression of SARS-CoV replication, suggesting a critical role of BAG3 in SARS-CoV replication.\n",
            " The SILAC approach relies on pre-experimental labeling to analyze the expression level of proteins, and is limited to in vitro investigation. Conversely, chemical isotope labeling targets the proteins or peptides after lysis (post experimental labeling). Theoretically, this approach is applicable to both in vitro and in vivo samples. The amine -NH 2 , thiol-SH or -COOH reactive groups of proteins or peptides are isotopically labeled and the samples are mixed equally and analyzed. Widely used methods in this category are isotopecoded affinity tag (ICAT), which targets thiol groups, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), which targets all the amine groups in the peptides, and 18 O-labeling, which targets the carboxyl group of peptides during enzymatic hydrolysis [51] . For the ICAT approach, although affinity purification of cysteine-containing peptides significantly reduces the sample complexity, it also prevents the identification and quantitation of peptides containing cysteines and a trypsin-cleavable site. ICAT, 2DE, and multidimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC MS/MS) were used to identify the differential expression profile of proteins upon infection of Atlantic salmon with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus. The majority of changes in expression levels of proteins, such as natural killer cell enhancement factor (NKEF), procathepsin L, superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase, and interferon-induced viral resistance protein Mx (IFI-Mx) appeared to be associated with the infectious process [54] . In 2006, Go et al. [55] analyzed the proteome of Drosophila cells infected by flock house virus using the stable isotope labeling method ICAT. This study characterized 1500 cellular proteins from the host, including 150 upregulated and 66 downregulated proteins. Functional classification revealed that these differentially expressed proteins belonged to cellular replication, apoptotic, and metabolic pathways. A more recent study surveyed the global differential protein expression in Vero E6 cells upon SARS-CoV infection. Different proteomic strategies, comprising 2D-GE-ESI-MS/MS using Cy3-Cy5 labeling for detection of bands and ICAT-labeling coupled with 2D-LC-MS/MS, defined the alterations in viral protein expression and host cell protein expression levels. The 2DE method identified 63 proteins belonging to 48 unique gene products. By contrast, the ICAT approach identified 322 proteins, with 119 upregulated proteins and 48 downregulated proteins, implying a higher sensitivity of ICAT in detecting differentially expressed gene products compared with the traditional 2DE method [56] .\n",
            " Isobaric mass tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) allows simultaneous quantitation of protein extracts from host cells upon virus infection. Li et al. [19] utilized shotgun proteomics involving offline coupling of an LC system with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS as a complementary approach to investigate the WSSV proteome. Forty-five viral proteins were identified, of which 13 were reported for the first time and seven were found to have acetylated N termini. RT-PCR confirmed the mRNA expression of 13 newly identified viral proteins. The iTRAQ technique was further used to differentiate the envelope proteins and nucleocapsid proteins of WSSV. Twenty-three envelope proteins and six nucleocapsid proteins were successfully identified based on iTRAQ ratios, demonstrating that iTRAQ is an effective approach for high throughput viral protein determination. iTRAQ labeling coupled with LC-MS/MS was also used to investigate the proteomes of a grouper embryonic cell line (GEC) infected with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and uninfected GEC. Forty-nine viral proteins were recognized, among which 11 were reported for the first time. Furthermore, 743 host proteins were uncovered and categorized into 218 unique protein groups. Thus, iTRAQ analysis of SGIV infection in GEC provided a novel insight into viral and host gene products at the protein level [57] .\n",
            " Among the various stable isotopic labeling methods, the newly established 18 O-labeling is the most cost-effective, in that the labeling reagent is heavy water (D 2 O). However, the major limitation of this approach lies in the fact that the analysis of the low mass difference between peptides, typically 2-4 atomic mass units, requires a highly sensitive MS instrument [58] . In a recent report, 18 O-labeling was used to study host-virus interactions between HIV-1 and the HIV-infected CD4 + cell line CEMx174. The cellular proteome of CEMx174 cell line upon HIV-1 infection was assessed using stable isotope labeling, 18 O/ 16 O, and accurate mass and time (AMT) tagging. The 18 O/ 16 O ratio was subsequently quantified with a highly sensitive FTICR-MS instrument. 3255 unique host proteins were identified, of which 344 were upregulated and 343 were downregulated. Functional analysis unraveled changes in proteins from various functional categories, including nuclear transport, ubiquitination, cell cycle progression, and the citrate cycle. At least seven proteins (CASP3, DLD, KPNA3, KPNB1, RAN, TPR, and UBE1) were further validated by Western blotting [59] .\n",
            " Taken together, although there have been only a tiny number of large-scale screens of host-virus interactions (HCV, herpesviruses, and West Nile virus), the data seems encouraging. However, the majority of host-virus research has focused on small-scale investigations. The data available can only give us a limited view of the diverse biology of host-virus interactions. More data from a more diverse set of screens and techniques is necessary to achieve a com-plete picture of all host-virus interactions.\n",
            " The rapid advances in MS-based proteomics strategies have facilitated the global analysis of not only virion proteomes, but also the detection and identification of novel virionassociated viral and cellular proteins. The Y2H system, TAP-tagging method, in vitro pull-down assays, and immunoprecipitation techniques have detected seminal protein-protein interactions between viruses and their corresponding host cells. RNAi screening technology has further characterized the physiological significance of these interactions, which have been corroborated by mutations or other functional experiments. As for protein expression analysis, several isotope-labeling techniques have been able to complement the traditional 2DE coupled with mass spectrometry strategy to identify global alterations in cell protein levels during viral infection. However, the functions of most of those identified virion-associated proteins, as well as alterations in cellular proteomes or novel protein interactions, have yet to be characterized. Moreover, protein interaction screen results, using either the Y2H system or protein complex purification and mass spectrometry, are expected to increase exponentially in the future. This will require matching advances in computational biology techniques to model, visualize, and analyze the detailed interaction maps occurring during the viral infection processes. These viral proteomics technologies hold much promise for improving our understanding of virus-host interactions. Such an understanding will ultimately aid the diagnosis of specific infectious diseases, as well as help in the design of novel antiviral drugs and vaccines for various virus-human interactions and for targeted treatments.\n",

            "Title: R E V I E W Innate defences against viraemia\n",
            "Body Text: Innate nonspeci®c resistance mechanisms are important barriers to pathogens particularly in maintaining an initial critical balance at the onset of infections. They represent a conglomeration of mechanical barriers, cellular reactions and molecules with antimicrobial activity. Here we will consider the antiviral molecules which have been reported to occur in human serum, because viraemia is an important mode of viral spread to the target organs in the body. Normal human serum has been reported to possess inhibitory activities against particular viruses and individual groups of viruses. These antiviral activities reside in a variety of uncharacterised or partly characterised substances [1, 2] . Recently certain molecules in normal human serum have been described that are active against a broad spectrum of viruses [3, 4] . These molecules have been characterised for their antiviral activity, molecular structure and mechanism of antiviral action. In this review, we emphasise the properties of broadly active antiviral molecules in human serum and explore the possibility that they can be important as natural defence mechanisms.\n",
            " As noted above, the innate antiviral activities reside in a variety of uncharacterised or partly characterised substances, most of which are distinguishable from antibody, interferon and complement. Many of the antiviral substances have generally been reported to act against single viruses, such as coronavirus, Newcastle disease virus, variola virus, Sendai virus and vesicular stomatitis virus [5±9] . Some are active against individual virus families, including myxoviruses, togaviruses and retroviruses [10±12] . The mechanisms of action of these viral inhibitors, when known, vary. Some of them act by irreversible neutralisation of infectivity, as in the case with coronavirus and Sendai virus inhibitors [5, 8] . The myxo-and togavirus inhibitors appear to prevent haemagglutination but not infectivity [10, 11] . The inhibitor of vesicular stomatitis virus acts by penetration of the viral envelope and inactivation of viral RNA [9] . The retrovirus inhibitor works via complement mediated lysis of the virally infected cells [12] . Heparin, which may be used medically to prevent clotting, has narrow antiviral activity, but deserves to be mentioned because of its potent activity against HIV-1 [13±15].\n",
            " Only four broad-spectrum viral inhibitors have been reported in human sera. IFN and TNF occur in response to infections, in¯ammation and cancer [16±19]. The others are constitutive, i.e. UTIb and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and their antiviral activities are presented in Table 1 [3, 4, 20] . The antiviral activity was determined by a plaque reduction assay as described previously [21] . The assay was done in duplicate, using the continuous presence of 2-fold serial dilutions of the test substance in 96-well microtitre plates with con-¯u ent cell monolayer and challenged with 40 PFU of virus (MOI=0.03). One unit (U) of antiviral activity was de®ned as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the inhibitor showing 50% reduction of plaques compared with the virus control. A reference virus inhibitor standard was used in each assay as a positive control. The viruses used in these studies were originally from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, except Coxsackie virus B3, which was obtained from Dr Charles J. Gaunt, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX. Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cell, American Type Culture Collection, CCL81) were used for assaying the viruses except for vaccinia. For this virus CERs (chicken embryo reticulocytes) received from the laboratory of Dr Robert Shope, Yale University, CT at that time, were used [3, 4] . A broad antiviral activity may be an important feature of an antiviral defence. Table 1 shows that UTIb and HDL inhibited all of the viruses tested, which included DNA and enveloped and nonenveloped RNA viruses. However, UTIb was not active against HIV (unpublished ®ndings). The inhibitory activity of UTIb was usually greater than HDL against the same virus, so UTIb appears to account for most of the antiviral activity of human serum. The two preparations of HDL were comparable except that the preparation from Dr G. M. Ananthramiah, Department of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and The Arthrosclerosis Research Unit, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294-0012, USA, was inactive against poliovirus. This difference could be due to the extent of processing used in different methods of puri®cation.\n",
            " As determined enzymatically UTIb is a glycoprotein. It has a M r of approximately 60t10r10 3 based on HPLC size exclusion chromatography. Its antiviral activity is stable at pH 2±10 and at 80uC for up to 10 min. Mild oxidation by sodium periodate and glycolysis by a mixture of glycosidases destroys its antiviral activity. Proteinase digestion degrades the inhibitor into small components of M r <1000, which retain broad antiviral activity. This activity of the small components has increased heat stability (120uC for 15 min) but is still inactivated by glycosidases. Thus the antiviral activity appears to reside mainly in a separable oligosaccharide moiety of the glycoprotein, UTIb [3] .\n",
            " Human serum HDL is a lipoprotein of M r 300 000 and occurs in the serum in the range of 30 to 80 mg/dL. Its antiviral property seems to reside in its protein component apolipoprotein A-1. Apolipoprotein A-1 has been reported to inhibit HIV and HSV-1 [22, 23] . As shown in Table 1 HDL is broadly active against DNA and enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses.\n",
            " Brie¯y, the mode of inhibition during virus growth was determined by investigating whether the inhibition was the result of (1) direct reversible neutralisation of virions, (2) inhibition of virus attachment to cells, (3) inhibition of viral penetration of cells or (4) effects later in the virus multiplication cycle. The reversibility of inhibition of viral infectivity was determined by mixing the inhibitor preparation with the virus suspension and then incubating the mixture at 37uC for 2 h. After incubation, the mixture was diluted beyond the inhibitory level to determine the residual titre of infectious virus that was not irreversibly neutralised by the inhibitor. The results indicated that UTIb and HDL did not irreversibly inactivate either enveloped or non-enveloped viruses.\n",
            " The possibility of inhibition of virus attachment to target cells was examined by comparing the inhibitory titres at 4uC for 2 h (virus attachment only) with 37uC for 2 h (virus attachment and penetration). A virus challenge dose of 40 PFU was used to infect the con¯uent monolayer cells in a 96-well microtitre plate at the two temperatures. The cultures were then washed three times with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and overlaid with 0.5% methylcellulose in Hepes buffer (MC) [24] . Plaques were stained with crystal violet and read on day 2. The rationale for this experiment is that at 4uC the cell membrane is physiologically inert, and hence virus replication should not proceed beyond initial attachment to the target cell. Equal antiviral activity (titres) at 4uC and 37uC imply that the antiviral substance is active at 4uC, and, therefore, acts at the stage of virus attachment to target cells. Inhibitors acting at post-attachment stages result in signi®cantly higher titres at 37uC. As shown in Table 2 the titres of UTIb at 4uC and 37uC for all viruses used except HSV-1 were statistically indistinguishable. In the case of HSV-1, an inhibitory titre of 48 U/mL occurred at 37uC compared with 9 U/mL at 4uC, indicating that some of the inhibition of HSV-1 replication is at a step subsequent to adsorption.\n",
            " In comparison, in the case of HDL, Sindbis or mengo virus attachment was not inhibited at 4uC, indicating that HDL inhibited at a post-attachment step in virus replication. To study the possibility that the HDL prevents penetration of virus into cells, a modi®ed method previously described was followed [23] . To allow only virus attachment, the cells were precooled to 4uC for 1 h in a 96-well microtitre plate, infected with 40 PFU (MOI=0.03) of Sindbis or mengo virus, and after 1 h in the cold to allow virus to attach to cells, washed twice with cold HBSS to remove unabsorbed virus. The cells were warmed to 37uC to initiate virus penetration for 1 h in the presence of serial two-fold dilutions of inhibitor to allow any inhibitory effect to occur during the time of penetration. The cultures were then washed once with HBSS and refed Eagles minimum essential medium (EMEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). To each well 50 mL containing 100 U/mL of antibodies speci®c to the virus was added to neutralise any virus held extracellularly by the HDL. The cells were then incubated at 37uC for 0.5 h before washing and refeeding. Antibody controls showed the effectiveness of antibody neutralisation at 0.5 h. The cells were washed twice with HBSS, and then over layered with 0.5% MC and incubated until the plaques developed. The plaques were counted and the percent inhibition of plaques relative to control was calculated as an indicator of inhibition of virus events at the stage of virus penetration. The results in Table 3 show that cells infected in the presence of HDL consistently retained virus on their surface as evidenced by the effectiveness of neutralisation by antibody added 1 h after the start of incubation with HDL. Thus, in the presence of HDL, virus attachment occurred, but penetration did not occur.\n",
            " The time of inhibition of virus replication during its growth cycle was determined as described previously [24] . The inhibitor preparation was added at various times during a one-step growth cycle of the virus and virus yield was determined during the single cycle by harvesting virus at 8 h. Synchronised initiation of virus replication (designated 0 h) was obtained by infecting monolayers with virus in 96-well culture plates at 4uC for 2 h to allow attachment of virus. The cells were then washed three times with cold EMEM to remove unabsorbed virus and inhibitor and then refed with warm (37uC) inhibitor or EMEM containing 2% FBS. After incubation for completion of a single cycle of virus replication at 8 h the cultures were stored at x70uC. For virus yield, quadruplicate wells were pooled for virus plaque assay. The virus yield was calculated from the PFU endpoints. The results are shown in Figure 1 and indicate that inhibition of Sindbis virus occurred principally when HDL was added between 0 and 1 h during the growth cycle. This early inhibition indicates that the antiviral action of HDL occurred early in the virus growth cycle and is consistent with an inhibition of viral penetration as determined in the preceding section.\n",
            " The possible induction by the serum inhibitors of a durable antiviral state in cells (e.g. similar to IFN) by UTIb and HDL was determined. Serial dilutions of the inhibitors and cell monolayers were incubated overnight. The cells were washed \n",
            " The main broad-spectrum viral inhibitors in serum are UTIb and, to a lesser degree, HDL. Preincubation of virus with UTIb and HDL did not reduce infectivity, indicating that they do not bind irreversibly to virions or irreversibly neutralise their infectivity. Similarly preincubation of cells with HDL and UTIb, unlike IFN, did not induce an antiviral state in the cells. Inhibition experiments at 4uC and 37uC revealed that UTIb inhibits virus by preventing virus attachment. This same type of experiment showed that HDL, on the other hand, acts against most viruses at a post-attachment stage. Further investigations of mechanism of viral inhibition by HDL indicated that HDL inhibits the multiplication cycle at an early stage between 0 and 1 h of initiation, most likely by preventing penetration of cell surface by virus.\n",
            " In vivo studies of the protective role of these broad-spectrum serum inhibitors have not been done. There is, however, one report of in vivo protective effect of a broadly active, nonspeci®c virus inhibitor found in vertebrate nervous systems. Protection of inhibitor-treated mice was demonstrated against both an alphavirus and a picornavirus (Table 4 ). Based on this protection and other correlations, the authors suggested a natural defensive role for this broadly antiviral inhibitor that is present widely and in high concentration in tissues and extracellular¯uid of human nervous system [25] . Similar in vivo protection studies should be done with the serum inhibitors. A possible defensive role of the narrowly active serum inhibitors in natural resistance has been reviewed by Kriznova and Rathova [10] . The mechanisms of action of these inhibitors are competitive inhibition of virus attachment to cells and neutralisation of viral infectivity by a mechanism unlike classical antibody because complement is not needed for their activity. The various approaches undertaken to elucidate the possible role of these serum inhibitors in the natural resistance of the organism was grouped into three categories. In the ®rst category an effort was made to ®nd a correlation between the susceptibility of experimental animals to a particular virus, and the natural inhibitory activity of their sera [1,26±28] . The correlations showed that the experimental animals used were resistant to several strains of in¯uenza virus when innate serum inhibitors against these strains were present in their sera [27] .\n",
            " In the second category, efforts were made to measure the effect of suppression or deletion of serum inhibitors on the susceptibility of the experimental animals to virus infection. In several experiments it was shown that mice and hamsters fed ethionine had appreciably reduced virus inhibitory activity in serum against in¯uenza A 1 and Newcastle disease viruses than did untreated . These observations point to a relationship in vivo between the level of serum inhibitors and in¯uenza virus multiplication and thus support the notion that the narrowly active, nonspeci®c viral inhibitors can be a factor in innate resistance to speci®c viruses. The third category assessed the direct effect of administering the inhibitors at different times during viral infection. Experimental animals were administered an inhibitor preparation at different intervals either before or immediately after virus inoculation. Using gamma serum inhibitor it was shown that the multiplication of the inhibitor-sensitive strain of in¯uenza A 2 virus in mice lungs was inhibited. This effect was seen only when the inhibitor was administered before the virus had time to penetrate into susceptible cells. The inhibitor and the virus were administered intranasally [32±36]. Gamma inhibitor given intranasally 4±6 h post-infection or later was not protective while high doses of inhibitor given ip even at longer intervals after infection showed an appreciable protective effect [34] . While there is no satisfactory explanation for this ®nding, it appears that, overall, gamma inhibitor can function as a defence mechanism under some conditions.\n",
            " We have compared the properties and mechanisms of action of constitutive (UTIb and HDL) and inducible (IFN and TNF) inhibitors because of their importance as broadly active defences against viraemia. Table 5 compares the properties of these inhibitors and shows that constitutive virus inhibitors, UTIb and HDL, are clearly distinct from the inducible IFN and TNF defences.\n",
            " Innate antiviral substances present in human plasma have not been carefully explored as natural defences against viraemia and infection. This review indicates that plasma contains several naturally occurring nonspeci®c antiviral substances, some of which are broadly active against a wide range of DNA and enveloped and nonenveloped RNA viruses. The mechanism of action of the broadly active UTIb occurs during virus attachment and that of HDL during virus penetration. A limited study of the in vivo protective role of some of the antiviral substances indicates their importance against infection, particularly in early stages of infection before reactive host defences, like IFN and speci®c immunity, are induced. Further studies are needed in this area of virology.\n",

            "Title: pathogens A Systematic Review Analyzing the Prevalence and Circulation of Influenza Viruses in Swine Population Worldwide\n",
            "Body Text: Influenza viruses are the members of Orthomyxoviridae family and have a wide host range [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Due to unique physiology, swine are considered the \"mixing vessel\" for influenza viruses [7] . Four types of influenza viruses have been reported in swine i.e., influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), influenza C virus (ICV), and influenza D virus (IDV). The genomes of IAV and IBV have eight gene segments of single-stranded negative sense RNA while the genomes of ICV and IDV have seven gene segments [8] . Among the eight gene segments of IAV and IBV, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are most significant and crucial for the pathogenicity of these viruses which neuraminidase (NA) are most significant and crucial for the pathogenicity of these viruses which determine the antigenic properties. The HA gene regulates the attachment of virus particles to the host receptor while NA gene regulates the release of progeny virus into the host cell. Co-infection of swine with two or more IAV strains may trigger the reassortment [9] which in turn, could facilitate the emergence of new influenza virus strains [10] [11] [12] . Point mutations which occur due to an errorprone RNA polymerase that lacks the ability of proof-reading and corrections during replication may also complement the genetic diversity of the influenza viruses [13] . The mechanisms of reassortment and point mutations may give rise to \"antigenic shift\" and \"antigenic drift\" within HA and NA genes, respectively, facilitating the emergence of new subtypes and lineages of influenza viruses. As a result, total 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes of IAV [14] [15] [16] and two lineages (Victoria/B and Yamagata/B) of IBV have been reported so far in different hosts [17, 18] .\n",
            " The host range of IAV and IBV is determined by their specificity to sialic acid receptors. The HA proteins of IAV can bind to α-2,3 and α-2,6 sialic acid receptors present in avian and human trachea, respectively [19] [20] [21] . Interestingly, swine trachea has both, α-2,3 as well as α-2,6 sialic acid receptors, due to which swine can become infected with avian and human strains of influenza viruses [22] .\n",
            " The genomes of ICV and IDV have a gene segment termed as \"hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion\" (HEF) which carries out the functions similar to that of HA and NA genes of IAV and IBV. The HEF is responsible for attachment and release of ICV and IDV virus particles into the host cell [23] [24] [25] . The particles of both virus types ICV and IDV bind to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid receptors of the host [25] . Several studies have shown that human and avian origin influenza viruses can be transmitted to swine in natural settings and thus may evolve into new strains of reassorted influenza viruses [26, 27] .\n",
            " Historically, the first flu pandemic (Spanish flu) hit the human population in 1918 [28] and killed approximately 50 million people globally [29] . The 1918 influenza pandemic emerged as a result of reassortment in which human H1 virus acquired avian (poultry) N1 neuraminidase along with internal protein genes and evolved into what is now termed as \"classical H1N1\" virus [30] ( Figure  1 ). The second flu pandemic occurred in 1957 (Asian flu) and was traced to the H2N2 virus which killed approximately two million people [31] . The third flu pandemic hit the human population in 1968 (Hong Kong flu) with an H3N2 outbreak and killed approximately two million people [31, 32] . The second flu pandemic occurred in 1957 (Asian flu) and was traced to the H2N2 virus which killed approximately two million people [31] . The third flu pandemic hit the human population in 1968 (Hong Kong flu) with an H3N2 outbreak and killed approximately two million people [31, 32] . The most recent flu pandemic (Swine flu) originated in swine in Mexico during March-May 2009 [33] databases.

            " The first report of IAV in Cameroonian swine appeared when A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was documented during 2009-2010. The youngest infected swine was four-month old which suggested that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus can infect the young piglets [51] . Nine more swine herds in Cameroon were found infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 and H1N1 viruses during May-June 2011 [52] . A multiple-site study including free-roaming and penned swine along with domestic poultry and Columbiformes birds between December 2009 and August 2012 identified one IAV positive swine at each of the two study sites. The inter-species transmission of IAV was ruled out as all the birds were negative for the IAV [53] .\n",
            " The first evidence of the past IAV infection in Nigerian swine appeared in 2008 when H1N1 and H3N2 virus antibodies were detected in swine sampled at three different locations [54] . Shortly after that, in 2009, the first report of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus appeared in the Nigerian swine when one swine herd was found seropositive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Interestingly, eight other swine herds were found seropositive for the H1N1 and four herds were found positive for human-like H3N2 viruses. The seroprevalence of IAV further increased as 66 swine herds were detected positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and 53 herds were found seropositive for H1N1 virus in 2012 [52] . The active infection (viral RNA) of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was first reported in the Nigerian swine between July 2010-June 2012 when 18 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates were retrieved from the swine in Lagos. The zoonotic transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus to the exposed human workers was ruled out as all the human samples were negative for the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus [55] .\n",
            " Nineteen more A(H1N1)pdm09 and five human-origin H3N2 viruses were identified in the Nigerian swine during 2013-2015 [56] . Later one more report of the human strain of H3N2 virus appeared in swine during January-February 2014 [57] . A high seroprevalence of IAV in a commercial piggery was reported in Lagos. Total 197 human and 281 swine sera samples were screened which determined that 87% human and 67% swine sera had antibodies for IAV depicting the past exposure [58] but the active infection was absent given that all nasal swabs were negative for IAV infection [58] . Lately, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) strain H5N1 was detected in 22 swine samples between December 2015 and February 2016 during an ongoing H5N1 disease outbreak in Nigerian poultry [59] which indicated the inter-species transmission of H5N1 virus from poultry to swine [59] .\n",
            " A molecular study reported the negative prevalence of avian-like H5N1 and H5N2 viruses in Egyptian swine in May 2008 [60] but the serological investigation identified H5N1 virus antibodies in seven and H5N2 virus antibodies in four swine sera samples [60] which suggested a past exposure of these swine to the viruses. The active H5N1 infection in Egyptian swine was again ruled out in October 2013 as the viral RNA could not be detected in 36 swine samples but interestingly, the antibodies against avian-like H5N1, H9N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were detected in swine sera samples which suggested a past exposure [61] . Interestingly, 122 of the 157 swine nasal swab samples collected during 2014 and 2015 were found positive for IAV active infection using RT-PCR. As a result, HA subtyping identified 46 avian-origin H5N1, seven H9N2 and 69 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses [61] .\n",
            " The first report of IAV in swine in Kenya appeared in May 2010 when A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were detected in eight swine samples collected from the Asembo and Kibera counties and at a Nairobi based abattoir. The extended serological study further identified H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in swine during August 2011 to December 2012 [62] . The active IAV infection was reported in four household members Pathogens 2020, 9, 355 9 of 54 having acute respiratory illness while the backyard swine were negative for the IAV and IBV in Kiambu county during September 2013-August 2014. On the contrary, the serology identified the IAV antibodies in 230 swine sera samples suggesting a past exposure of IAV [63] . The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was again reported in five swine samples collected from a slaughterhouse in Kenya during September 2013-September 2014. Interestingly, all the 288 human subjects including the slaughterhouse workers or the traders and farmers who had visited the slaughterhouse were negative for IAV, hence ruled out the zoonotic transmission [ [66] and in Togo during October 2012-January 2014 [67] . The human strain of H3N2 virus was detected in swine in Ghana during January-February 2014 [57] . One more report documented IAV in swine in two districts of Uganda in 2015 [68] .\n",
            " Overall, influenza viruses have been reported in swine from eight African countries including Cameroon, Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, Reunion island, Togo, Ghana, and Uganda ( Figure 4A ). The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which originated in Mexican swine in 2009, has been reported in all except Ghana and Uganda. Interestingly, the HPAIV strain of H5N1 has been reported in swine in Nigeria and Egypt while HPAIV strain H5N2 and low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) strain H9N2 have also been reported in the Egyptian swine (Table 1) .\n",
            " China is considered the epicenter of influenza viruses [69] . The first seroprevalence of IAV in Chinese swine was documented during 1977-1982 when antibodies for 38 H1N1, 22 H3N2, 12 H4N6, 12 H5N3, and seven H9N2 viruses was detected in swine sera obtained from apparently healthy swine [70] . The first ever report of ICV in swine was documented from the apparently healthy swine in Beijing when 15 ICV isolates were retrieved during January-December 1981 [38] . Three isolates of reassortant H1N2 virus were identified after an influenza-like illness triggered abortions and mortalities in sows on a swine farm in November 2004 [71] . The same year, LPAIV strain H9N2 was isolated from the sick or dead swine in China which was the first ever isolate of H9N2 virus retrieved from a swine [72] .\n",
            " First human-origin H1N1 and four human-origin H3N2 virus isolates in Chinese swine were retrieved during 2005-2006 [73] . Further, two isolates of swine H3N2 viruses, four isolates of avian-origin HPAIV strain H5N1 and two isolates of H1N1 viruses were detected in swine nasal swab and lung tissue samples collected from swine in central provinces of China during 2004-2006 [74] . Surprisingly, two isolates of equine influenza virus H3N8 were also detected in swine during December 2005 and January 2006 [74] . Another report of avian-origin H9N2 virus in Chinese swine was documented during 2006-2007 when four H9N2 virus isolates with closely related nucleotide sequences were retrieved from swine [75] . Each of the two different investigations reported 19 H1N1, one H1N2 and nine H3N2 virus isolates from Chinese swine during 2006-2009 [76, 77] ; the H1N2 virus and all nine isolates of H3N2 viruses were either double or triple-reassortant viruses [76] .\n",
            " The first report of HPAIV strain H5N1 in swine was documented during October 2008-May 2009 when two H5N1 virus isolates were retrieved from apparently healthy swine [78] . The third report of avian-origin H9N2 virus in Chinese swine appeared when 144 apparently healthy swine across four provinces viz., Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang were found H9N2 positive over a four-year period during March 2008-March 2012. The frequent interactions of birds to the swine at the study sites was reported which was suspected to be the most likely source of infection [79] . Further, a novel strain of avian-origin H4N1 virus was isolated from a Chinese swine in 2009 [80] . Several classical and avian-like H1N1, Eurasian avian-like H1N1, triple-reassortant H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were reported in Chinese swine between 2009 and 2016 [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] . A triple-reassortant H1N1 virus having the internal genes of avian, human, and swine lineages of influenza viruses was reported from a two-month old piglet on a Guangdong based swine farm in January 2010 [92] . Three reassortant H3N2 virus isolates having internal genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were reported in swine between November 2010 and June 2011 [93] .\n",
            " A three-year old boy was diagnosed with European origin avian-like H1N1 virus on a family swine farm in a rural area of the Jiangsu province in December 2010 which speculated a zoonotic transmission from swine to the boy [94] . The first report of H10N5 avian-origin influenza virus in a domestic swine in Hubei province further extended the diversity of swine influenza viruses and provided another evidence of interspecies transmission of avian influenza virus to the swine under natural conditions [95] . Several other avian-origin H3N2, H4N8, H6N6, H7N9, H5N1, and H9N2 virus antibodies were detected in swine in China during April 2010-June 2014 [86, [96] [97] [98] .\n",
            " Another interspecies transmission of avian-like H1N1 virus in southern China was observed when 219 swine and 61 swine farm workers were identified to be infected with avian-like H1N1 swine influenza virus between March 2011 and March 2013 [99] . Further a zoonotic transmission of H9N2 virus was identified at a Shandong based swine farm during May 2013-April 2014 when H9N2 virus antibodies were detected in 84 swine and four farm workers. The wild birds visiting swine feeding sites at the swine farm were speculated to serve as the carrier for H9N2 virus [100] . Zoonotic transmission of H1N1 virus was reported on a swine farm in Shandong province between March 2015 and February 2016 among the swine exposed human workers having influenza-like illness. As a result, five of the 32 (15.6%) nasal swab samples were found IAV positive; a married couple exposed to swine were found infected with H1N1 virus [88] .\n",
            " The IAV infection was also documented in 44 wild boars in Jilin province of China between April 2015 and February 2016 [101] . The first report of the IDV prevalence in Chinese swine documented 21 IDV positive swine in the Guangdong province in 2016 [44] . The swine IDV sequences shared high similarity (99-100%) with IDV sequences reported earlier from the bovine species in China [102] which indicated the transmission of IDV from bovine to swine in China.\n",
            " Hong Kong is a special administrative region while Tibet is an autonomous administrative region under the control of People's Republic of China. The H1N1 and H3N2 virus isolates were successfully retrieved from apparently healthy swine in Hong Kong during July 1993-June 1994 [103] . Further, classical swine H1N1, H3N2 and avian-like H9N2 viruses were identified in Hong Kong based swine between March 1998-June 2000; two independent introductions of the avian-like H9N2 viruses were ascertained from avian species to the swine [27, 104, 105] .\n",
            " The first information of IAV seroprevalence in Tibetan swine appeared during April-December 2010 when antibodies against H1N1 and H3N2 viruses were detected in swine sera collected from Tibet [106] .\n",
            " The first report of H1N1 seroprevalence in swine in Bhutan appeared when H1N1 virus was detected in backyard as well as breeding swine during October 2011 and February 2012 [107] .\n",
            " The H1N1 virus was reported in swine over a five year-period between 2006-2010 while the A(H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2 viruses were identified only in 2010 [108] . Later three triple-assortant H3N2 viruses were isolated and sequenced from the backyard swine between May 2011 and July 2012 [109] .\n",
            " The antibodies against A/Hong Kong(H3N2) virus termed as \"A/Swine/Wadayama/5/69\" were first detected in Japanese swine in 1969 [110, 111] . The H3N2 virus seroprevalence in Japanese swine was further documented in Sendai City during 1977 to 1980 [112] ; the transmission between human and swine was also suggested [112] . The first active IAV infection was reported when two reassortant H1N2 virus isolates were retrieved from the Japanese swine having influenza-like disease in 1978. The isolated H1N2 virus was believed to be a recombinant of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses [113] . Further 340 swine were diagnosed with H1N1 antibodies in Toyama Prefecture between 1978-1982. A lower seroprevalence was observed during the summer months while the seroprevalence was relatively higher during the winter season [114] . Again, one more H1N2 virus was isolated and characterized from the sows in Ehime Prefecture in September 1980 [115] . Intriguingly, 18 H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 viruses were detected in swine imported from the United States, however, all the imported swine from the Europe were negative for the IAV infection. This was the first report of the IAV infection in the imported swine [116] .\n",
            " The ICV seroprevalence (19%) in Japanese swine was first reported in the Hyogo Prefecture during July 1981-June 1982 [117] but swine in Yamagata Prefecture were found seronegative for the ICV between August 1979 and March 1986 which suggested a localized transmission of ICV in swine within Hyogo Prefecture [118] .\n",
            " Several other reassortant H1N2 virus isolates were reported in Japanese swine after 1991 [119] . One novel reassortant H1N2 virus appeared to have emerged from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was reported in swine in Gunma Prefecture while two other H1N2 viruses appeared to have emerged from the Japanese H1N2 viruses with internal genes from A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. One more H1N2 virus was detected in swine which was closely related to the Japanese H1N2 virus [120] .\n",
            " The immunohistochemistry identified lesions in the lungs of the sick swine infected with reassortant H1N2 virus [121] . Additionally, several H1N1 and H3N2 viruses have also been reported in Japanese swine between 1990 and 2017 [122, 123] . Interestingly, six H1N1 virus isolates were identified with reassorted genes from A(H1N1)pdm09 virus while one H1N1 isolate appeared to have H1 gene from Japanese swine influenza virus with internal genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Further, one H3N2 virus isolate was determined to have genes of Japanese swine influenza and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses [124] . These results reflected the occurrence of the reassortment events between Japanese swine influenza and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.\n",
            " IAV seroprevalence has lately been reported in wild boars (Sus scrofa leucomystax) in Japan. Three wild boars in the Yamaguchi Prefecture were found seropositive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus while nine wild boars in Tochigi Prefecture were seropositive for the swine H1N1 virus. But, the active IAV infection could not be identified in these wild boars as all the nasal swab samples were negative for IAV and IBV [125] . In a more recent investigation, fifteen wild boars were found seropositive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Kagoshima Prefecture between November 2014-December 2017 while two of these fifteen wild boars had antibodies against H1N2 and H3N2 viruses as well [126] . This reflected a past exposure of the Japanese wild boars to the IAV strains.\n",
            " The first active IAV infection in the Korean swine was identified in December 1998 when three H3N2 virus isolates were recovered from the swine experiencing an acute influenza-like respiratory disease. The close relatedness of these Korean swine H3N2 isolates with human-origin H3N2 viruses reported from Korea between 1987-1999 suggested the events of reverse zoonosis [127] . One unique H7N2 virus isolate was detected in swine which had seven gene segments originated from Hong Kong avian-origin H7N2 virus isolated in 1978 and the NS gene originated from Hong Kong H5N3 virus isolated in 1977. Additionally, four typical swine influenza H1N1 viruses were identified in swine [128] . Several H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses were detected in symptomatic South Korean swine after 2000 [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] . The IAV localization in the swine lung tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemistry [130] . Total 35 avian-origin H5N2 viruses of Eurasian lineage were identified in swine in different South Korean provinces during 2004-2008 which suggested cross-species transmission of H5N2 virus [135] .\n",
            " Three H1N1 virus isolates closely related to US isolates of H1N1 were obtained from 45-day-old piglets in Korea in January 2005. The other swine farms in the proximity of this index farm were negative for the H1N1 virus [136] . Further, one H1N1, two H1N2, and one H3N2 subtypes of IAV identical to the American strains based on their HA and NA gene sequences were obtained from swine nasal swab, lung, and thoracic fluid samples during 2005-2006 which suggested that there was no probability of arising of these IAV strains in Korea through recombination [137] .\n",
            " Two novel isolates of swine H3N1 virus with high genomic similarity to each other were retrieved from two different swine farms in Korea during March-April 2006 which would be due to a common origin of these isolates. These viruses had human-like H3 gene while other gene segments originated from swine influenza viruses within Korea. High reactivity of the 52 swine sera samples to H3N1 virus antibodies suggested a previous exposure and probability of the swine to swine transmission of H3N1 virus [138] .\n",
            " The human to swine transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was reported in Chungbuk province where 42 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates were recovered from swine lung tissues [139] . The reassortment between A(H1N1)pdm09 and swine H1N2 viruses emerged into a novel reassortant H1N2 virus in swine [140] . A triple-reassortant H3N2 virus was identified in swine during December 2011-May 2012 which indicated the IAV reassortment was taking place in Korean swine [141] . A swine fever eradication campaign identified nine A(H1N1)pdm09, two classical H1N1 and one H1N2 viruses in wild boars which were hunted and killed in South Korea during 2012 [142] . More recently, a complete genome sequence of H1N1 virus was reported from a domestic swine in Korea in 2016 [143] .\n",
            " The occurrence of IAV in Thai swine was first reported during November-December 1978. Active H3N2 infection was detected in one swine while several other swine had H3N2 antibodies [144] . Two H1N1 virus isolates from Thai swine were first recovered in January 1988 [145] . Several studies reported H1N1, A(H1N1)pdm09, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses in swine exhibiting respiratory disease symptoms between 2000 to 2014. Intriguingly, one swine sample was found co-infected with four IAV subtypes including H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, and H3N2 viruses [146] [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] .\n",
            " The first evidence of H5N1 seroprevalence in Thai swine was documented in 2004 when eight H5N1 positive swine sera samples were identified [153] . Later ten H1N1 and two H3N2 virus isolates were retrieved from piglets aged between 4 to 12 weeks during 2008-2009 [154] . Interestingly, most of the virus isolates retrieved in this study were obtained from 4 to 8 week-old piglets which was in agreement of a previous report stating that swine influenza viruses can be successfully retrieved from piglets less than ten weeks of age [155] .\n",
            " A zoonotic transmission of IAV was reported at a Thai swine farm where all the swine were found positive for either H1N1 or H1N2 virus. Interestingly, two farm owners, 46 swine handlers, four veterinarians, five farm cleaners and two farm office workers also reported IAV seroprevalence. This study claimed that there was transmission of swine influenza viruses from swine to human however the possibility of human to swine transmission was ruled out [156] .\n",
            " After a respiratory disease outbreak in nursery piglets, 15 nasal swabs were found positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus between December 2009 and March 2010. Fifteen sera samples of the farm workers along with three sera from dogs and one serum obtained from a cat were negative for IAV, hence the interspecies transmission of IAV was ruled out [157] .\n",
            " The first report of active infection with reassortant H1N1 virus in Thai swine appeared in February 2010 but the follow up screenings conducted after two and three months, respectively confirmed the cessation of the active infection as the viral RNA was not detected anymore [158] .\n",
            " The reshuffling and reassortment of IAV internal genes were reported in Thai swine in February 2012. The HA and NA genes of H1N1 virus isolates clustered with the Eurasian swine-like IAV lineage while the H3N2 viruses diverged and formed a separate group. All the internal genes of H1N1 and H3N2 virus isolates appeared to be derived from A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses which confirmed the events of reassortments [159] .\n",
            " The events of reverse zoonoses were suggested after the detection of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus seroprevalence in Vietnamese swine during October 2009-March 2010 [160] . One more evidence of reverse zoonosis was identified during February-March 2010 after six triple-reassortant H3N2 viruses having a novel cluster of the Triple Reassortant Internal Gene (TRIG) cassette were isolated. The HA and NA genes of these reassortant H3N2 isolates originated from human H3N2 viruses reported between 2004-2006 while the other six internal genes had a high similarity with the Korean and American isolates [161] .\n",
            " Two more studies reported the H1N1, A(H1N1)pdm09, HIN2, and H3N2 virus isolates during February 2010-December 2013 from clinically healthy swine with no influenza disease symptoms [162, 163] . Additionally, the antibodies for A(H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2 viruses were detected in swine which suggested a past exposure of swine to these viruses [163] .\n",
            " A high seroprevalence of H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 viruses was detected in human and swine sera in Calcutta, India during 1982-1990 [164] . The first active infection of IAV in Indian swine appeared in 2009 when A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates were reported from a swine farm located in Uttar Pradesh. Interestingly, the retrieved A(H1N1)pdm09 virus sequences were similar to the North American and Korean viruses which might be either because of trade or long-distance transmission [165] .\n",
            " After an influenza outbreak on Lebanese poultry farms in 2005 the farmers fed the carcasses of the dead flocks to the swine. Intriguingly, a following investigation found that three swine were seropositive for the H9N2 virus while approximately one-third of the poultry farm workers were seropositive either for H1 or H9 viruses [166] . These results revealed the interspecies transmission of IAV among poultry, farm workers and swine.\n",
            " The seroprevalence of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in four to six-month-old Malaysian swine at 41 swine farms was reported during May-August 2005. Co-infections of H1N1 and H3N2 were detected in 29 swine samples [167] .\n",
            " The seroprevalence of H3N2 virus in swine samples obtained from the slaughterhouses in Laos was reported between May 2008 to January 2009 [168] .\n",
            " A full-length genome sequence of a reassortant H1N1 virus was reported from a Russian swine in 2016. The HA and NA genes of this virus isolate shared 90% identity with the H1N1 viruses that were reported from humans in the USA in the 1980s [169] .\n",
            " The human to swine transmission of IAV was speculated after IAV antibodies were detected in 147 Taiwanese swine during June 1969-May 1970. The results were further confirmed with virus isolation which retrieved 13 IAV isolates [170] . More recently, IBV of Victoria/B lineage was detected in swine nasal swab samples collected from apparently healthy swine at three swine farms in 2014 [171] .\n",
            " An active IAV infection in 52 swine within four provinces in Indonesia was identified during 2005-2009. Interestingly, 39 H5N1 virus isolates were successfully retrieved and sequenced [172] .\n",
            " The first report of influenza in Sri Lankan swine was documented during 2004-2005 after one human-like H3N2 virus was identified. Later, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates were identified in swine during 2009-2012. A spillover of these viruses from human to swine was speculated [173] .\n",
            " One recent investigation in Kazakhstan during 2017-2018 identified nine H1N1 and eight H3N2 viruses in human while seven H1N1 and four H3N2 viruses were identified in swine. Interestingly, 10 of the human samples were also positive for IBV infection while the swine samples were negative for IBV [174] .\n",
            " In summary, the influenza viruses have been reported in swine in 16 Asian countries including China, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Taiwan, India, Bhutan, Russia, Laos, Malaysia, Lebanon, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Sri Lanka ( Figure 4B ). Apart from the most common IAV strains of H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, several avian-origin H5N1, H5N3, H4N1, H4N6, H4N8, H6N6, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N5 influenza viruses were also reported in Chinese swine. Horse to swine transmission of equine influenza virus H3N8 was reported in China. Additionally, avian-origin H7N2, H5N2 viruses were identified in South Korean swine while H5N1 was reported in Indonesian swine. Interestingly, after the swine were fed upon dead poultry carcasses in Lebanon the H9N2 virus was detected in Lebanese swine. The IBV was reported in Asian swine only in Taiwan while strains of ICV were reported in swine in China and Japan while IDV was recently reported in Chinese swine (Table 1) .\n",
            " Swine influenza was first reported in Australian swine only in 2009 after a swine farm owner reported coughing symptoms among swine. Simultaneously, some of the human workers on the farm also developed influenza like symptoms and hence stayed out of the farm until recovery. Later, the farm owner also developed similar symptoms following which he was tested for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus which resulted positive. As a result, a representative number of swine showing coughing symptoms and loss in appetite were sampled for molecular diagnostics and serology which confirmed that 12 swine were positive for H1N1 virus [175] .\n",
            " Second report of IAV in Australian swine appeared on a Queensland farm in August 2009 when a veterinarian observed elevated temperature, coughing and loss of appetite in swine. Simultaneously, two of the staff members on the farm exhibited influenza-like symptoms and hence were sampled for diagnostic testing using nasal swabs. Interestingly, both the staff members and four of the swine were found positive for the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Sequencing identified that the HA gene of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus retrieved from a staff member was identical to the virus retrieved from the swine which suggested transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus between swine and human [176] .\n",
            " Third report of IAV in Australian swine appeared when a respiratory disease outbreak in swine and the farm workers occurred in Perth, Western Australia during 2012 which identified 43 IAV positive swine. Sanger sequencing of HA and NA genes identified six novel HIN2, three novel H3N2, one A(H1N1)pdm09 and two seasonal H3N2 viruses in swine. On the contrary, only one out of eight human workers were found positive for seasonal H3N2 virus. This study could not conclude the event of zoonotic transmission of IAV between swine and human workers at the farm [177] .\n",
            " The fourth report of IAV was documented when 14 IAV positive swine were identified at a commercial swine farm in Western Australia during July-September 2012 and later during September-November 2016. Additionally, 17 swine were determined to be IAV positive in southern Queensland. The complete genomes of 10 IAV isolates retrieved in Western Australia and Queensland were successfully sequenced which identified seven H1N2, two human-like H3N2 and one H1N1 virus [178] .\n",
            " Overall, four reports of IAV outbreaks in swine in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia were available ( Figure 4C ). The H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 subtypes have been reported from Australian swine with relatively low prevalence.\n",
            " The H1N1 virus was identified in swine lung tissues or trachea of two of the deceased sows after an influenza-like disease erupted at two swine farms in January 1979. Interestingly, it was also reported that the identical virus was detected in wild ducks in Germany [179] . Since it was already established that H1N1 from wild ducks can successfully infect swine if inoculated via intranasal route [179] hence this observation suggested the transmission of H1N1 from wild ducks to the swine [180] . A second investigation isolated three avian-like H1N1, two H1N2 and twelve human-like H3N2 viruses from eight commercial swine farms in March 1999 [181] .\n",
            " Denmark has been running a passive surveillance program for IAV detection in swine since 2011. The H1N2 virus having the H1 gene which evolved from H1N1 avian-like viruses and N2 gene which evolved from human H3N2 viruses was reported in swine during 2011-2013 [182] . This was an example of how IAV can evolve through reassortment and may emerge into a new IAV strain.\n",
            " The other investigation included swine sampling at different time intervals to assess the persistence of IAV shedding in Danish swine which detected one avian-like H1N1 and 107 reassortant H1N2 viruses. This study observed that most of the swine were shedding IAV right before achieving six weeks of age. Surprisingly, a piglet as young as just three days was found infected with IAV [183] . Two H3N2 isolates having H3 genes from seasonal human influenza along with internal genes that originated from A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and NA genes from contemporary N2 swine influenza viruses that have been in circulation in Denmark were retrieved from young piglets at two locations during 2011-2014 [184] . H3N2 virus was also detected from piglets having respiratory illness and from sows with reproductive problems in commercial piggeries in 2014 [184] .\n",
            " The H3N2 virus antibodies were first detected in English swine in 1973 which revealed the past exposure of swine to H3N2 virus [185] . Later, the antibodies for H1N1 and H3N2 viruses were detected in swine at a slaughterhouse in England during 1991-1992 [186] . Interestingly, this serological investigation also reported the antibodies for IBV in eight and for ICV in 198 swine [186] .\n",
            " A molecular investigation identified a novel H1N7 virus in swine in England which had six of its RNA segments closely related to those of human viruses while two RNA segments were identical to those of equine viruses which concluded that the H1N7 strain may have evolved due to reassortment between human H1 and equine H7N7 viruses [187, 188] .\n",
            " The first report of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in English swine appeared in September 2009 when histology and immunofluorescence assays followed by molecular diagnostics and sequencing confirmed four A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infected swine in the Northern Ireland [189] . After this, 17 more A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates were reported in swine in England during September 2009-October 2010 which revealed that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was in circulation in English swine during the 2009 flu pandemic [190] . The same year, four H1N2 virus isolates were reported in English swine which had six internal genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus along with HA and NA genes of H1N2 virus hence were identified as the novel reassortant H1N2 strains [191] . In a more recent study, two more IAV positive swine were identified in the United Kingdom in 2016 [192] .\n",
            " However the first report of seroprevalence of H1N1 virus in Finnish swine appeared in 2008 during an investigation which detected H1N1 virus antibodies in swine at seven swine farms which further increased to 24 swine farms in 2009 [193] but the first isolate of avian-like swine H1N1 virus (indicative of active infection) was detected from the lung tissues of a swine in February 2009. Later, the first A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Finnish swine was detected in November 2009 [193] . Three more swine were identified with IAV antibodies during May 2011-January 2014 which was due to a past exposure to IAV [194] .\n",
            " The H1N1 viruses in turkey and swine were identified after the swine influenza outbreak hit the turkey population in Brittany, France in February 1983 which suggested that IAV transmission happened from swine to turkey [195] . Later two strains of H1N2 virus were isolated from six swine exhibiting influenza-like illness in Brittany during 1987-1988 [196] . Another investigation reported H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses in swine herds experiencing respiratory disease in Brittany region [197] .\n",
            " A negative prevalence of IAV was reported in wild boars in Camargue during September 2009-November 2010 given that all the 315 nasal swabs obtained from either hunted or trapped wild boars along with all the sera samples were negative for IAV [198] .\n",
            " A more recent investigation reported the zoonotic transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus from swine to a farmer in January 2018. This farmer along with a veterinarian collected nasal swab samples from three pregnant sows exhibiting influenza-like illness on the swine farm and submitted to a local diagnostic laboratory for analysis which, as a result, were found IAV positive. Few days later, the farmer and the veterinarian both developed the influenza-like symptoms. The farmer was later diagnosed with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus [199] .\n",
            " Sixty-five IAV positive wild boars were identified across five German states during 1997-2006. Cloning and sequencing identified H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in these wild boars [200] . Later thirteen H1N1, three reassorted A(H1N1)pdm09 and four H1N2 viruses were detected in swine during 2009-2010. Interestingly, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates had high similarity with the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses reported earlier in humans within Germany which suggested a reverse zoonotic transmission of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus [201] .\n",
            " A nationwide sero-surveillance identified 12,585 swine with H1N1, 9,566 swine with human-like H1N2, 12,220 swine with human-like H3N2 and 11,086 swine with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus antibodies during June 2009-December 2012 which reflected a high seroprevalence of influenza viruses in German swine population [202] .\n",
            " Later 273 IAV positive swine exhibiting influenza-like illness were detected between January 2010-December 2013. Subtyping successfully distinguished 198 of 273 samples into H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. The H1N1 virus was the most widely occurring in German swine while A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had the lowest prevalence [203] .\n",
            " The H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were detected in swine sera samples collected from apparently healthy swine at 42 swine farms during 2002-2004 and from 46 swine farms during 2010-2012 [204] .\n",
            " The seropositivity of Italian swine to H3N2 virus was first reported during December 1976-November 1977 when 24 swine were detected with H3N2 antibodies [205] . The first report of H1N1 active infection in Italian swine appeared during an influenza disease outbreak between 1977 to 1986 which identified 63 H1N1 viruses [206] . Further, four H3N2 viruses were detected in swine nasal swabs originated from three swine farms and an abattoir during 1981-1982 [207] .\n",
            " Later 47 H1N1 and 37 H3N2 viruses were detected in swine during 1992-1995. Interestingly, four human sera samples were also positive for H1N1 and 77 samples were positive for H3N2 viruses which might be due to the transmission between human and swine [208] . Further IAV seroprevalence was detected in the age group of three-month to four-year old swine during 2002-2004 [209] .\n",
            " The first report of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Italian swine appeared after a respiratory disease outbreak in piggeries in Lombardia region of Northern Italy in November 2009. Piglets experienced diarrhea and weight loss while the sows experienced reduction in reproduction rate [210] . Two more A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates were reported in female swine in Sicily in December 2009 [211] while five isolates of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were identified in swine at three different locations during 2011-2012 [212] .\n",
            " A novel strain of reassorted H1N2 virus having 99-100% identity through six gene segments with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus along with HA and NA genes similar to H1N2 virus was reported in swine in Mantua Province [213] . Reassorted H1N2 viruses were again detected in 34 piglets during 2013-2014 [214] .\n",
            " Seroprevalence of Italian wild boars with one H1N1, ten H1N2, and one H3N2 viruses at two different locations was reported during 2012. On the contrary, active infection was found only in three wild boars whose nasal swabs were positive for the IAV [215] . One more investigation reported active infection of IAV in 12 wild boars while 78 wild boars had IAV antibodies during July-December 2012 [216] . Further molecular and serological investigations detected avian-like H1N1 viruses in Italian wild boars [216] .\n",
            " The first complete genome sequence of IDV in Italian swine was retrieved from a symptomatic sow in 2015 which was identified to be closely related to the IDV sequence reported in Oklahoma swine in 2011 [217] . Further IDV prevalence in Italian swine was reported when 14, three and four swine were found positive for IDV antibodies in Veneto, Emilia Romagna and Lombardia regions, respectively during June 2015-May 2016. As a result, swine clinical samples collected during 2013-2014 were investigated retrospectively for IDV prevalence but were reported negative. An extended serological investigation detected IDV antibodies in 364 swine sera samples collected during 2015. These findings suggested that IDV was in circulation in Italian swine population only after 2014 [45] .\n",
            " Isolation and characterization of 12 H3N2, nine H1N1 and one H1N2 viruses reported the prevalence of influenza viruses for the first time in Spanish swine herds experiencing the respiratory illness and pneumonia during November 2001-April 2004 [218] . More strains of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 viruses were isolated, sequenced and characterized in Spanish swine during 2006-2011 [219] [220] [221] . Interestingly, five H1N1, three H1N2, and four H3N2 virus isolates retrieved between January 2010 and August 2011 had significant similarities with other European isolates which was an evidence of continent-wide transmission of these swine influenza viruses [220] .\n",
            " A molecular investigation reported a negative prevalence of IDV in swine in Luxembourg during 2009 but later successfully detected three IDV positive swine during 2014-2015. Further, the serological investigation confirmed that swine in Luxembourg were free from IDV during 2012 but interestingly, IDV antibodies were detected in 17 swine samples collected during 2014-2015. These observations suggested that IDV was not in circulation in swine in Luxembourg during 2009-2012 but became prevalent at a low frequency later during 2014-2015 [46] which was almost the same time IDV was reported in Italian swine populations [45] .\n",
            " A serological investigation of swine in the Netherlands identified 601 H1N1, 584 H1N2, and 229 H3N2 virus antibodies in 29 swine herds during January-May 1999 [222] with no further evidence of IAV in swine in the country after that.\n",
            " After the 18 swine which were experiencing influenza-like illness were found infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus on a Norwegian swine farm in October 2009 the surveillance was expanded to the 39 nearby swine farms which determined that 23 of these farms were positive for the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Intriguingly, one human subject at the index farm who had influenza-like symptoms was also found positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. This study suggested that the symptoms first appeared in the human subject at the index farm and later the disease got transmitted to the swine. Hence the findings of this study suggested the reverse zoonosis of the influenza virus from human to pig [223] .\n",
            " Further molecular and serological investigations identified 48 more swine herds that were positive for IAV during September 2009-October 2010 [224] . A more comprehensive nation-wide surveillance in Norwegian swine identified 16 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus positive swine herds during 2009 which later increased to 190 swine herds in 2010 [225] . Later 194 more swine were found infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Norway between April and July 2011 and reported that the IAV infected swine took longer to weigh 100 kg body mass [226] .\n",
            " The first active IAV infection in swine in Poland was reported in 2010 when 21 oral fluid samples collected from three swine farms detected IAV [227] . Soon after, five avian-like H1N1 viruses were reported from the swine lung tissues during 2011-2013 [228] . Later a serological surveillance identified 1212 H1N1, 851 H1N2, 1012 H3N2, and 572 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus antibodies in swine during March 2011-February 2015 [229] . Surprisingly, 34 of these swine had antibodies against all four IAV subtypes i.e., H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses [229] suggesting the past co-infections.\n",
            " The human-like H3N2 virus was isolated from a swine in Czechoslovakia during 1969-1972 [230] ; however, no other reports ever appeared from the country in later years.\n",
            " Complete genome of an H1N1 virus was reported from a Hungarian swine having fever and conjunctivitis in May 2011 [231] . This was the only report of H1N1 virus in the swine in Hungary.\n",
            " A large-scale investigation across seven European countries reported a high seroprevalence (>62%) of IAV antibodies in swine populations of Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy while a relatively lower (<21.25%) seroprevalence was observed in swine populations of Czech Republic, Poland and Ireland during 2002-2003. Antibodies against H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses were reported in swine from the European countries under surveillance except Poland where swine had antibodies against only H1N1 virus [232] .\n",
            " A virological surveillance across five European countries including Belgium, United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain reported 169 IAV positive swine during 2006-2008. The H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses were detected in swine from Belgium, Italy, and Spain while the samples from United Kingdom and France were found infected with H1N1 and H1N2 viruses [233] .\n",
            " Briefly, the virological and/or serological prevalence of influenza viruses in European countries ( Figure 4D ) identified the strains of H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in swine populations of the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Germany, France, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, Spain, Poland, Greece, Hungary, Netherlands, Czech Republic, and Czechoslovakia while the swine in Luxembourg and Italy were found infected with IDV.\n",
            " Shortly after a respiratory disease outbreak in swine in Manitoba, an autopsy was done on a dead swine on March 1, 1967. The histopathology confirmed the bronchitis in the deceased swine and a strain of IAV designated as \"S/Manitoba/647/67\" was characterized using IAV antisera [234] . The first report of H1N1 virus in Canadian swine appeared in Quebec during 1980s-1990s when five genotypes of H1N1 virus were identified [235] . Since then several studies have reported H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 viruses in Canadian swine [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] [241] [242] [243] .\n",
            " Another study reported nine isolates of swine influenza viruses with an antigenic variant from the sick swine having proliferative pneumonia in Quebec, Canada during 1990-1991 [244] . In a retrospective diagnosis, only one formalin-fixed paraffin embedded swine lung tissue collected during 1991 was found IAV positive with immunohistochemistry. This investigation suggested that immunohistochemistry can be useful in retrospective diagnosis of the swine influenza virus [245] .\n",
            " The broncho-intestinal pneumonia in lung tissues of dead swine was reported on a swine farm which exhibited disease symptoms including coughing, weight loss, and labored breathing. Interestingly, before the onset of the disease symptoms, this farm conducted a routine serological surveillance of influenza virus which identified H1N1 virus in only one of the twelve swine samples [246] .\n",
            " Following this surveillance, a three-month old swine from the same farm was found positive for avian influenza virus H4N6. The complete genome of this H4N6 virus was reported in 1999. This was the first ever report of an avian-origin H4N6 virus in swine. The proximity of the swine farm to a natural lake where several wild bird species including waterfowls which were reported to visit frequently might be the reason behind the introduction of this avian influenza virus strain to the swine [246] . Later three avian-origin H3N3 influenza virus isolates were recovered from swine in eastern Ontario exhibiting weight loss and coughing during October 2001. On a nearby farm located approximately 30 kms away, another H3N3 virus isolate was recovered from the swine. There was no recorded movement of the swine between these two farms. Since these were avian-origin H3N3 viruses hence the role of birds in transmission cannot be ruled out. Later, on a third farm, where an influenza like disease had been affecting mainly the nursery piglets, an H1N1 virus was recovered in May 2002 [247] .\n",
            " Reassortant H1N1 and H1N2 viruses were detected in swine nasal swab or lung tissue samples obtained from three-week old piglets and sows exhibiting typical influenza-like symptoms in Ontario during 2003-2004 [248] . First triple-reassortant (avian/classical swine/human triple-reassortant) H3N2 viruses from four swine and one human nasal samples were identified in Ontario during 2005. The phylogenetic analysis determined that all the virus sequences were 100% identical to each other which apparently emerged from triple-reassortant H3N2 viruses reported in US based swine in 1988 [249] . One more report of triple-reassortant H3N2 (trH3N2) viruses appeared on the swine farms located in Saint-Hyacinthe, Assomption and Saint-Foy during early 2009. The trH3N2 viruses identified in this study were determined to be closely related to North American/Canadian trH3N2 viruses reported earlier [250] . Later A(H1N1)pdm09 and H1N1 viruses having internal genes of triple reassortant H3N2 virus were reported in swine in four provinces including Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Quebec during 2009 [251] .\n",
            " The first evidence of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Canadian swine appeared in 2009 after the human workers at a swine farm developed influenza-like illness. The investigation identified that two farm workers along with 56 swine were positive for the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus from human to swine was suggested [252] . The same year 17 more swine were detected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus after a respiratory disease outbreak hit the Alberta swine farms [253] .\n",
            " A reverse zoonotic transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus to swine from a human subject who visited Mexico and returned to the swine farm was reported in April 2009. As a result, ten swine having severe disease were sacrificed for necropsy which identified lesions in the bronchioles corresponding to the influenza virus disease. Virus isolation and sequencing identified the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Additionally, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was identified in two more human subjects who were exposed to the swine hence indicated the occurrence of zoonoses on the swine farm [254] .\n",
            " Later during summer 2009, ten more A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from five swine herds in Manitoba were reported. Virus shedding was observed up to 20 days post-infection after the appearance of the clinical symptoms in swine [255] . This observation was in agreement of a previous report which documented the experimental infection of swine in the laboratory and determined that virus shedding occurs until 11th day after appearance of the clinical symptoms [256] . Another investigation reported nine A(H1N1)pdm09 and four H3N2 viruses after an influenza-like disease outbreak on a Quebec based swine farm in December 2010 [257] .\n",
            " The effect of microclimatic conditions on the transmission dynamics of swine IAV in the barns was studied which observed that high relative humidity in the environment during summer months suppresses the aerosol transmission of the droplets which in turn decreases the transmission of IAV [240] . The high relative humidity in the environment would facilitate the generation of larger droplets which do not tend to shrink easily and hence are less likely to be aerosol transmitted to a longer distance as they fall on the ground quickly after their formation [240, 258] . As a result, a lower transmission of IAV is observed usually during the summer months. On the contrary, the IAV transmission increases during winter months when relative humidity is relatively lower [258] .\n",
            " The IAV was first isolated from the nasal discharge of a swine in the United States in 1931 [34] and from the human in 1933 [35] . The first report of human-origin IAV in swine appeared in the United States on 24 May 1937 after an unexpected result was observed when the serum sample of a sick swine obtained from a State Prison Farm located in New Jersey neutralized the antibodies of human influenza virus. A series of investigations made a strikingly new observation that swine had suffered from a human strain of influenza virus [259] .\n",
            " Serological investigations conducted during 1950s suggested that the weight loss and mortalities among swine were due to swine influenza viruses [260, 261] . Swine influenza viruses were isolated from febrile swine at nine occasions during 1965-1968 in Wisconsin and Nebraska [262] . Additionally, swine influenza antibodies were also detected in swine sera samples collected from six farms [262] . A virological surveillance conducted in Memphis, Tennessee and Madison, Wisconsin during May 1976 to June 1977 successfully isolated 478 influenza viruses from swine nasal swabs collected at abattoirs; approximately 300 of which were characterized to be swine H1N1 viruses. Additionally, the serological surveillance identified that 21% of the 9400 swine sera samples had swine H1N1 virus antibodies [263] . A small percentage (1.4%) of swine sera samples were found positive for the swine H3N2 viruses which was further confirmed by virus isolation [263] . Interestingly, this study identified inter-species transmission of swine influenza viruses between human and swine [263] .\n",
            " A novel swine-origin H1N1 virus termed as \"A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1)\" was detected at Fort Dix Army training camp in New Jersey in January 1976. The outbreak was localized and was limited to Fort Dix only. As a result, 230 soldiers were found infected with this novel virus; 13 of which had severe respiratory disease with one death due to viral pneumonia [264] [265] [266] . Since this novel swine-origin H1N1 virus quickly disappeared from Fort Dix hence the epidemiology and the origin of the disease could not be ascertained [264] .\n",
            " The H1N1 and H3N2 virus antibodies were detected in swine sera collected from an abattoir in North-West United States. Interestingly, a higher IAV seroprevalence was observed during the Fall and early winter months. Virus isolation and sequencing identified that the H1N1 viruses were closely related to the classical H1 swine influenza virus [267] . Classical swine-like H1N1 and triple-reassortant H3N2 viruses were identified in swine samples collected across 23 states in the USA during 1998-1999 [268] .\n",
            " The Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (MVDL) detected large number of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes of IAV in swine samples during 1998-2001 and again during 2007-2009. Interestingly, some of the samples were co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 viruses [269] [270] [271] . A second-generation reassortant H1N2 virus having genes from a reassortant H3N2 and classical H1 swine influenza viruses was obtained from the lung tissue samples of a dead sow at an Indiana swine farm in November 1999 [272] .\n",
            " A novel subtype of H3N1 virus termed as \"A/Swine/Minnesota/00395/2004 (H3N1)\" was identified during a severe respiratory disease outbreak on a swine farm in Minnesota in October 2004. Sequencing observed that the HA gene of this strain was closely related to swine influenza H3N2 virus while the NA gene was related to classical H1N1 virus which suggested that the novel H3N1 virus emerged due to reassortment between H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in the Midwest United States [273] . Further an H2N3 subtype of IAV which may have emerged as a result of a reassortment between avian and swine influenza viruses was identified on a commercial swine farm in Minnesota in April 2006 and again in September 2006 [274] .\n",
            " The first evidence of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in US swine appeared when four A(H1N1)pdm09 and one triple-reassortant H1N2 viruses were identified and characterized in the exhibition swine in the states of Minnesota and South Dakota in 2009 [275] . During last ten years, a large number of H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, A(H1N1)pdm09 along with reassortant IAV subtypes have been reported in the US swine populations [243, [276] [277] [278] [279] [280] [281] [282] [283] [284] [285] [286] [287] [288] [289] .\n",
            " The United States has a large feral swine population which is considered a reservoir of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses [290] . The swine-like H1N1, avian-like H1N1, swine-like H1N2, swine-like H3N2, human-like H3N2, A(H1N1)pdm09 along with avian-like H6N2 and H7N2 viruses were identified in feral swine samples collected across 35 states in the USA between October 2009-September 2013 [291] .\n",
            " Histological examination of the lung tissues obtained from two backyard piglets suffering from pneumonia and weight loss in Colorado in November 2010 suggested that the piglets were infected with swine influenza virus which were later confirmed to be infected with IAV subtype A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Since the piglets were raised at the house of a pharmacist hence a possible human to swine transmission was speculated given the possibility of an occupational exposure of the pharmacist to the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus at the pharmacy [292] .\n",
            " The first report of IBV infection in swine appeared when swine in the Midwest United States were found infected with IBV lineages of Yagamata/B and Victoria/B [37] . This was a new finding because initially IBV was thought to have a host range limited to human, pheasants, horses and seal [1] [2] [3] [4] .\n",
            " A novel strain of swine influenza virus was detected in Oklahoma swine exhibiting influenza-like symptoms in April 2011. The nasal swab samples taken from the swine were negative for the IAV infection. Hence the virus isolation was attempted in swine testicle cells; the cells in culture showed influenza-like cytopathic effects by third day. Electron microscopic observations revealed particles typical of a virus of Orthomyxoviridae family, but the RT-PCR was negative for the IBV and ICV. After ultracentrifugation was used for virus isolation, the genome of the virus was sequenced using Ion Torrent sequencing. The genome sequence analysis along with genetic and biochemical investigations revealed that the isolated virus was a novel Orthomyxovirus having 50% overall identity at amino acid level with human influenza C virus [43] . Since this novel virus was genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV therefore, later was proposed to be categorized as a new genus of Orthomyxoviridae family which was later accepted as influenza D virus (IDV) [5] .\n",
            " Later, two feral swine which were shot dead in a cotton field in Texas in June 2011 were found infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The significant identity of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolated from these two feral swine with human A(H1N1)pdm09 virus suggested a possible transmission between human and the feral swine [290] . Another study reported seroprevalence of H3N2 virus in one feral swine from Mississippi and in five feral swine from the state of California in 2005 but a negative seroprevalence was reported in the feral swine samples obtained from the states of Florida, Oklahoma and Missouri. Additionally, the seroprevalence of IAV was reported in feral swine from Texas where a total of 68 out of 472 feral swine sera were found positive for H3N2 and H1N1 viruses [293] .\n",
            " Another investigation detected H3N2 virus RNA in only one feral swine from a pool of samples collected across 31 states in the USA during 2011-2012 which indicated a negligible active influenza infection in US feral swine population. On the contrary, ELISA identified IAV antibodies in 182 feral swine samples while the serological subtyping identified H3N2 virus antibodies in 76 feral swine samples collected from 19 states which indicated a significant past exposure of US feral swine to the H3N2 virus [294] . Further, seroprevalence of IDV was reported in 49 feral swine samples collected from Oklahoma, Texas, Hawaii and North Carolina during October 2012-September 2013 which provided the first evidence of past IDV infections in US feral swine [295] .\n",
            " A study investigating virus shedding in nursery piglets found that all 81 piglets under investigation were shedding H3N2 virus starting seventh day of arrival into the barns until 29th day. Shedding was still observed in some piglets until 39th day [296] . Interestingly, 48 of these nursery piglets were also identified shedding H1N1 virus starting at the third day of arrival into the barns until 41st day over a 53-day observation period [296] . This was the new information which identified that young nursery piglets could get infected with IAV.\n",
            " The oral fluid samples collected from 25 neonatal piglets at four Oklahoma based swine farms during May-August 2014 [297] were found infected with different IAV subtypes including H1, N1, H3, and N2. This study supported the use of swine oral fluid samples in IAV diagnostics [285] . The swine oral fluid samples were also collected in North and South Carolina during June to August 2014 using the cotton rope hanging method [298] . In this method of sampling, swine are encouraged to chew the rope, as a result, saliva accumulates on the rope which is later squeezed to collect the sample aseptically. One of the benefits of this method of sampling is that each sample does not represent an individual swine but rather represents multiple swine that chewed the rope while hanging inside the pen [298] . Another benefit of this sampling method is that swine oral samples may contain contaminants like feed and feces but this method minimizes the chances of such contaminations in the sample [299] .\n",
            " Another investigation carried out metagenomic sequencing of swine nasal and rectal swabs obtained from apparently healthy swine which identified 11 IAV positive swine at three abattoirs and a buying station in USA in August 2015 [300] .\n",
            " In a striking observation, an avian-lineage H4N6 virus was isolated and sequenced from 7-8-month-old gilts on a Missouri based swine farm in December 2015 [301] . The investigators collected more samples at different time points for next few months at the same farm to assess the transmission of H4N6 virus among swine. No other samples were found positive for the H4N6 virus which suggested that the H4N6 virus did not transmit from swine-to-swine and therefore disappeared from the index farm. Interestingly, this extended study identified three H1N1 viruses infecting swine [301] .\n",
            " One large-scale study identified that 23 percent (2 947/12,814) of the swine samples were positive for the IAV in Mid-West United States between July 2011-March 2017, however, sequencing could identify only 173 H1 and H3 subtypes among positive samples [302] . A human to swine transmission of IAV was suggested when two human-like H3N2 virus isolates were identified from an Oklahoma based swine farm in 2017 which had high similarity with the human-like H3N2 viruses reported earlier from Baltimore [303] .\n",
            " Maya people represent ethnolinguistic groups in South and Central America. The practice of household swine keeping put the Maya people at high risk of contracting the swine influenza viruses. Thirty-one sera samples collected from the Maya people in Mexico were identified having antibodies against H1N1 and H3N2 viruses while 93 other sera had antibodies against the H3 subtype of IAV, representing a past exposure to these viruses [304] . However, this study did not include swine samples for investigation but since swine were household animals in their backyard hence the IAV seroprevalence of the Maya people could be because of a past transmission of these viruses from the backyard swine [304] .\n",
            " A retrospective study identified antibodies against swine-like H1N1, A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2, and human-like H1N1 viruses in backyard swine in Mexico between 2000 to 2009. This investigation retrospectively determined that the classical-swine H1N1 virus was most widely present in Mexican swine before the 2009 influenza pandemic [305] . Further, a significant number of swine experiencing respiratory illness had H1N1 or H3N2 virus antibodies in commercial piggeries in Sonora Province of Mexico during October 2008-March 2009. The molecular diagnostics and subtyping determined four H1 and two H3 viruses while 19 other IAV positive samples could not be subtyped given the low viral load [306] .\n",
            " During the influenza virus pandemic in Mexico in 2009, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was first identified in a single swine nasal swab. Additionally, H3N2, A(H1N1)pdm09 and IBV viruses were detected in four symptomatic humans [307] . The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolate retrieved from the swine was believed to be the first from the sister lineage of the pandemic influenza virus isolates reported in Mexico [307] .\n",
            " Further 59 IAV isolates were retrieved from Mexican swine having respiratory illness during 2010-2014. Intriguingly, this study identified 13 reassorted genotypes of IAV in Mexican swine [308] . This investigation also reported that IAV introduction into Mexican swine may have occurred through three different routes; human to swine transmission; reassortment between human-like H3N2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus; and through the long-distance movement of the swine from USA and Europe. A periodic introduction of IAV in Mexican swine occurred with the import of American and European swine to Mexico over two decades in 1980s and 1990s before the 2009 influenza pandemic [33] .\n",
            " Fifty-eight IAV whole genome sequences were retrieved from Mexican swine during 2010-2014. Genome sequence analysis identified classical H1N1, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Interestingly, the data obtained in this study suggested independent evolution of IAV in the Mexican swine population in different regions of the country. Phylogeny determined that Mexico City was the source of the 2009 influenza pandemic which erupted during March-May 2009 [33] . Later a reassortant H1N2 virus which had the genes from human and swine influenza viruses was isolated and sequenced from a swine in November 2014 [309] .\n",
            " The molecular diagnostics identified a total of 104 IAV positive commercial and backyard swine in Guatemala during 2010-2011 which resulted into three A(H1N1)pdm09 and one H3N2 virus isolates [310] .\n",
            " The first report of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in commercial piggeries in Cuba appeared in November 2010 when 24 swine were found positive for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus across five swine farms [311] . Further, five more IAV positive swine were detected in Pinar del Rio province of Western Cuba having respiratory illness and interstitial pneumonia. However only one IAV positive sample could be successfully subtyped as A(H1N1)pdm09 virus having reassorted internal genes, all except the NA gene [312] .\n",
            " In a more recent investigation, a high seroprevalence of IAV (114/309) was detected in swine in Trinidad and Tobago which later identified H3N2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in swine [313] .\n",
            " In summary, the H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were reported in North American swine population. Interestingly, the avian influenza virus strain H4N6 was detected in US based swine while H3N3 and H4N6 were identified in the Canadian swine and H5N2 was reported in the Mexican swine in 2018 ( Figure 4E ). Mexico City was identified to be the origin of 2009 influenza pandemic. It was also ascertained that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was present in Mexican swine well before 2009 pandemic erupted.\n",
            " After influenza virus outbreak hit a swine farm in Buenos Aires in November 2008, one of the five dead swine were diagnosed with viral pneumonia through immunohistochemistry. A full genome of H3N2 virus sharing 96-98% nucleotide sequence identity with H3N2 viruses reported in North America during 2000-2003 was recovered from the swine [314] .\n",
            " An H1N1 virus was reported from a swine after a swine farm manager along with his spouse experienced influenza-like symptoms few days before the outbreak erupted in the swine at a Buenos Aires based farm in June 2009. The influenza disease symptoms lasted for about a week in nursery piglets. Immunohistochemistry identified necrotizing bronchiolitis in four of the swine post-mortem samples while one sample had severe inflammation in the bronchiolar epithelia. The serological investigation detected IAV antibodies in most of the sera samples collected after 15 days of onset of clinical symptoms however the active infection was reduced to only six swine [315] .\n",
            " The third investigation carried out histopathology which identified lung lesions compatible to the influenza virus infection in nine swine necropsy samples at a Buenos Aires based swine farm in October 2009 and later in eight swine necropsy samples originated from a Santa Fe based farm in May 2010. The swine at Buenos Aires farm were found infected with H1N1 virus while the swine at the Santa Fe farm retrieved one H1N2 and three human-like reassortant A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates which had triple reassortant internal genes. This was the first report of human-like reassortant A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in swine in Argentina [316] . Later two more investigations using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, serology, and molecular analyses reported H1N2, H3N2, and reassortant H3N2 viruses with A(H1N1)pdm09 internal genes in swine in Argentina during 2011-2012 [317, 318] .\n",
            " Several H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, human-like H1N1, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been identified in Brazilian swine from the Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo provinces in Brazil during and after 2009 [319] [320] [321] [322] [323] [324] [325] . A technician who visited a Minas Gerais swine farm experiencing influenza outbreak developed similar respiratory disease symptoms. The nasal swab sample was obtained from the technician, as a result, one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was isolated which was closely related to the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses reported from the swine herd in the Minas Gerais which was recently visited by the technician. Hence it was concluded that a zoonotic transmission from swine to the technician occurred at the Minas Gerais swine farm [326] .\n",
            " An immunohistochemical investigation demonstrated microscopic lesions suggesting broncho-interstitial pneumonia in the lung tissues of four severely sick piglets at a swine farm located in Parana province in February 2011. The A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were isolated from two piglets. Additionally, a novel reassortant H1N2 virus was also recovered [327] . One more investigation identified that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was the most prevalent IAV subtype in sows. The co-infections of sows with A(H1N1)pdm09, H1N2, or H3N2 subtypes were also documented in Rio Grande do Sul province. These findings were noteworthy because the coinfections may trigger reassortments and thus may facilitate emergence of novel strains of IAV [328] . Later two more H1N2 viruses were isolated and characterized from swine in Rio Grande do Sul province during 2013. The sequences of both the isolates had high nucleotide similarity to each other in different genome segments in the range of 98.9% to 100% which suggested a common source of origin of both isolates [329] . \n",
            " The backyard productive systems (BPS) for raising swine, cattle, and poultry are popular in Chile. A molecular investigation reported a negative active IAV infection across 113 BPS units within ten counties in Chile during 2012-2014 but the serological investigation detected IAV antibodies in swine at two BPS units which suggested a past exposure of swine to the IAV [332] . Interestingly, the HA gene sequence of an H12 virus was obtained from a domestic Muscovy duck at one of the BPS which appeared to have originated from a wild bird. This suggested a spillover of the IAV from wild reservoir to the domestic poultry [332] .\n",
            " Another study reported the prevalence of H1N2 virus in swine reared at 40 different BPS having poultry and swine in El Yali wetland during 2013-2014 [333] . One more study identified four swine sera samples (4/64; 6.3%) that were found positive for IAV antibodies collected from different BPS in Central Chile. One pool of swine nasal swab samples (1/39; 2.6%) was also detected IAV positive with real-time RT-PCR. Interestingly, 7.9% chicken, 4.3% ducks and 11.1% geese samples collected from 329 BPS in Central Chile also had active IAV infections. The breeding practice of poultry and swine in the BPS was determined to be a major risk factor for IAV transmission [334] .\n",
            " Briefly, the IAV strains of H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been reported from the swine in Argentina and Brazil while A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was reported in swine in Colombia and Peru. Swine in Chile were found infected with H1N2 virus ( Figure 4F ).\n",
            " In summary, total 281 research articles were identified which reported several influenza viruses in swine populations globally. The highest number of studies were reported from Asia (n = 107), followed by North America (n = 76), Europe (n = 55), South America (n = 21), Africa (n = 18) and Australia (n = 4). The highest number of reports per country were documented in United States (n = 40) followed by China (n = 39) and Canada (n = 24). Until February 2020, influenza viruses have been reported from 53 countries worldwide. Four subtypes of IAV including H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were most frequently detected in swine populations ( Table 1) .\n",
            " Most of the large-scale studies used serological investigations including ELISA, hemagglutinin inhibition (HI), neuraminidase inhibition (NI), virus neutralization (VN), or microneutralization (MN) assays for the determination of the seroprevalence and subtyping of the influenza viruses in swine. Several investigations used virus isolation for the confirmation and subtyping of IAV. Most of the virological investigations used one-step real-time RT-PCR and/or reverse-transcription PCR for influenza virus detection and subtyping. Sanger sequencing or next-generation sequencing using MiSeq or Ion Torrent sequencing successfully generated the influenza virus sequences from the swine samples for epidemiological interpretations. Histological examinations including immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence were used to examine the swine lung or other internal organ tissue samples for the influenza virus diagnostics (Table 2) .\n",
            " As of February 2020, influenza viruses have been identified and reported in swine from 53 countries worldwide (Table 1 ; Figure 3 ). The influenza viruses have been detected in different sample types including swine sera, nasal, tracheal, oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal swabs as well as oral fluids collected from the live swine. Nasal and snout wipes, lung homogenates and fecal slurry samples were also used. Additionally, the lung as well as other internal organ tissues ( Table 2 ) obtained from either dead or sacrificed swine have also been used for the detection of IAV symptoms i.e., lesions in lungs, pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis etc.\n",
            " Various methods have been used for the detection of influenza viruses in swine samples depending on the sample type, sample numbers and objective of the study. Virus isolation methods, using either MDCK, Caco-2, HRT18, or swine testicle cells or the pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs, although considered the gold standard [335] [336] [337] have largely been taken over lately by the sequencing approaches which tend to provide a considerably faster identification of the IAV subtypes. The additional benefit of sequencing over virus isolation is that the sequences would be useful for analyzing the influenza virus outbreak clusters [338] , virus evolution or reassortment [339] using phylogenetic analyses in different gene segments. A recent study reported that next-generation sequencing can be useful in the influenza virus diagnosis and for the identification of the novel virulence markers and drug resistance [340] .\n",
            " Most of the studies have used real-time RT-PCR with matrix-gene specific oligonucleotide primers and TaqMan probe for IAV detection [308, 341, 342] . The conserved sequences of the matrix-gene specific primers can detect any IAV subtype in the swine samples [343] . Most of the studies used subtype-specific real-time RT-PCR for the IAV subtyping, however, few studies opted for the conventional approach of reverse-transcription PCR followed by Sanger sequencing for amplification of the HA and/or NA genes for retrieving the sequences for phylogenetic analyses to identify the subtypes. Although the real-time RT-PCR is a powerful and rapid tool for the subtyping of IAV strains, it is more expensive than reverse-transcription PCR. A few studies have reported reverse-transcription PCR based amplification of all the eight gene segments of IAV to generate the whole genome sequences [33, 91, 128, 231] but in most cases, the whole genome sequences were generated using MiSeq next-generation sequencing approach [150, 214, 325, 329] . A great advantage of this sequencing approach is that it can identify novel influenza viruses in the swine samples [80, 90, 301] .\n",
            " Most of the serological investigations used one or more methods for influenza virus detection and subtyping in the swine samples e.g., ELISA, HI, NI, MN, or VN assays. The serological methods are useful in large-scale surveillances for screening large number of samples in a limited time. However, the molecular detection assays are more reliable than the serological methods given the higher sensitivity, but the serological assays are rapid and affordable hence are preferred for large-scale surveillance studies. The molecular and serological investigations report either active infections (viral RNA) or past exposures (antibodies) in swine samples, respectively. The molecular detection approaches followed by sequencing are largely used for the research focusing on the influenza virus epidemiology [73, 78, 82, 87, 94, 128, 146, 150] . [5, 37, 43, 45, 46, 61, 74, 88, 137, 157, 171, 176, 188, 191, 199, 207, 215, [219] [220] [221] 241, 243, 248, 250, 263, 289, 290, 301, 306, 307, 326, 334] 2.

            " Rectal swab Nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, metagenomic sequencing IAV [300] Several studies used histological examinations e.g., immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence to identify the IAV symptoms in lung or other internal organs of either dead or severely sick swine sacrificed for the investigations [130, 189, 315, 318] . Immunohistochemistry provides a rapid and affordable diagnosis of the influenza virus disease using swine tissue samples [344] . One major benefit of immunohistochemistry is that it can be used in the retrospective analysis of the archived tissue samples [245] .\n",
            " A large number of investigations have reported sub-clinical influenza virus infections in asymptomatic (apparently healthy) swine [78, 103, 150, 161, 171, 278, 300] , indicating that influenza infections can go undetected while the swine may be shedding virus and hence may infect other swine and farm workers in contact [183] . Intriguingly, most of the swine samples processed in Australia, Europe, and North America were obtained from the symptomatic swine while most of the Chinese swine samples were collected from asymptomatic swine ( Figure 5 ).\n",
            " Symptomatic swine may exhibit mild or severe influenza like symptoms [59, 202, 252] , including fever, coughing, sneezing, pneumonia, bronchitis, reduced appetite, diarrhea, nasal and/or ocular discharge, conjunctivitis, weakness, anorexia, prostration, weight loss, abortion in sows, and mortality in some cases [89, 224, 231, 239, 248, 282, 318] . Most studies where the swine were severely infected reported reduced appetite and weight loss [129, 246, 247, 292] . Due to IAV infection, the swine takes longer to weigh 100 kg body mass [226] , hence the IAV disease burden affects the swine farmers economically.\n",
            " Varying rates of mortality of swine due to IAV infections were reported from around the world ranging from 0.5% to 30% [138, 206, 213, 218, 221, 273, 296, 327] . This wide difference in mortality rate could be due to novel virus strains emerged through reassortments within the swine [273, 315, 327] or inter-species transmission, e.g., avian to swine transmission, resulting into severe disease outbreaks [27, 80, 119, 133] . One example of the emergence of a novel influenza virus strain is the emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 strain due to reassortment between avian and swine IAV strains in swine which resulted into 2009 influenza pandemic [33] . Additionally, the emergence of IAV subtype H1N2 is another classic example of influenza virus reassortment which resulted into severe disease outbreaks in Japanese and Korean swine populations during 1990s and 2000s [27, 121, 140] .\n",
            " Strains of IAV can infect the swine of any age group; piglets as young as one week may become infected with IAV naturally. Interestingly, a study in Denmark observed a piglet as young as just three days was infected with IAV despite having maternally derived IAV antibodies [183] , suggesting that the infection might have occurred from the infected sow which was shedding the virus [183] . However, the symptoms of the influenza-like illness in swine may last only for one week but the virus shedding may still persist until 41 days after appearance of the influenza-like symptoms [183, 296] . This phenomenon may have serious implications in influenza virus spill over to the non-infected swine as well as to the exposed farm workers due to prolonged virus shedding. Three other studies observed virus shedding in swine and reported that the virus shedding may persist until the 11 day [256] , 20 day [255] , or 29 day [296] after onset of the clinical symptoms in swine. This variation in the duration of the virus shedding might be strain dependent, which needs to be further investigated.\n",
            " A higher rate of virus shedding and IAV prevalence was reported during the fall and early winter months than summer season because the high relative humidity present in the environment during summer decreases the transmission of influenza virus [267] . The high relative humidity in summer facilitates the generation of larger droplets which are less likely to be aerosol transmitted to a longer distance as they tend to fall on the ground quickly after their formation [240, 258] .\n",
            " Several cases of inter-species transmission were identified which documented transmission of IAV between human and swine or between birds and swine. The occurrence of the avian influenza virus strains in swine in China (H5N1, H9N2, H4N1, H4N6, H5N3, H10N5, H4N8, H6N6 , H7N9), United States (H4N6, H6N2, H7N2), Canada (H4N6, H3N3), South Korea (H7N2, H5N2), Nigeria (H5N1), and Egypt (H5N1, H5N2, H9N2 ) serve as the evidence of interspecies transmission of avian influenza viruses to swine. The first evidence of avian influenza virus active infection in swine appeared in 1999 in Canada when H4N6 virus was isolated from a swine. Later several other avian-origin IAV strains were detected and sequenced in swine in China, Canada, and South Korea ( Figure 6) .\n",
            " A large number of investigations have reported sub-clinical influenza virus infections in asymptomatic (apparently healthy) swine [78, 103, 150, 161, 171, 278, 300] , indicating that influenza infections can go undetected while the swine may be shedding virus and hence may infect other swine and farm workers in contact [183] . Intriguingly, most of the swine samples processed in Australia, Europe, and North America were obtained from the symptomatic swine whi Egypt is recognized as a \"hot spot\" for the influenza virus reassortment due to its geographical location [345] . The role of migratory wild birds in the introduction of avian influenza in Egypt has been already established [346, 347] , and the highly pathogenic strains of the IAV have previously been detected in migratory birds in Egypt [348] . Since migratory wild birds were reported to harbor in the vicinity of Cairo [60] therefore, the probability of the migratory bird-swine interaction in the regions remain high which very well explains the occurrence of highly and low pathogenic strains of avianorigin IAV in swine in Cairo, Egypt. Given the \"mixing vessel\" nature of the swine, the occurrence of avian-origin IAV strains in swine is alarming in terms of IAV reassortment and evolution which may trigger the emergence of novel IAV strains of pandemic potential in the future.\n",
            " Further, the multiple reports of double or triple reassortant IAV strains in swine are evidence that IAV co-infections may facilitate the antigenic diversity of the influenza viruses; and as a result, new HA and NA subtypes of IAV may be continually added to the existing 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes in the future. Intriguingly, the frequency of the occurrence of double or triple-reassortant IAV strains in swine has dramatically increased in the recent decades [76, 81, 87, 109, 161, 250, 268, 278] . One unique example of the reassortment and evolution of the pandemic strain of IAV in swine was the emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in swine in Mexico which evolved due to the reassortment between avian and swine IAV strains [33] .\n",
            " While an overwhelming majority of investigations reported IAV in the swine across the world ( Figure 7A) , there were only a few reports which documented either active infections or past exposures of the swine to the influenza virus types IBV [37, 171, 186, 277] (Figure 7B ), ICV [38, 117, 186] ( Figure 7C ) or IDV [5, [43] [44] [45] [46] 217] (Figure 7D) . A low prevalence of IBV was observed in swine given that only one study reported the IBV antibodies in swine samples in England during 1991-1992 [186] with no evidence of further spill over to other European countries. The active infection of IBV was later reported in US swine when two IBV isolates were obtained in 2009. A recent study from Taiwan reported three strains of the Victoria/B lineage of IBV in naturally infected swine in 2014 [171] , again Various studies have spotted wild birds visiting the swine farms or in the vicinity which suggested that wild birds may have served as the carriers for the introduction of the different avian-origin IAV subtypes to the swine populations [59, 80, 100, 246, 332] . The highest number of avian-origin IAV strains were reported in Chinese swine which shows frequent avian-swine interaction in China, a country that has historically been an epicenter for influenza virus disease [69] .\n",

A recent study from Taiwan reported three strains of the Victoria/B lineage of IBV in naturally infected swine in 2014 [171] , again there was no further report of dissemination to nearby Asian countries. The IBV infected swine were apparently healthy with no signs of influenza disease.\n",
            " Pathogens 2020, 9, x 32 of 54 there was no further report of dissemination to nearby Asian countries. The IBV infected swine were apparently healthy with no signs of influenza disease. The first report of ICV appeared in Chinese swine after the virus was isolated from apparently healthy swine in 1981 in a routine diagnostic procedure at an abattoir in Beijing [38] . Later ICV seroprevalence was reported in English and Japanese swine during 1980s-1990s [117, 186] with no further evidence of circulation anymore thereafter.\n",
            " The IDV was first detected and characterized in 2011 in Oklahoma based swine in the United States which appeared to have made a species jump from cattle to swine [5, 43] . Interestingly, a complete IDV genome was retrieved from a symptomatic sow in Italy in 2015 which was found closely related to the IDV genome reported in 2011 from Oklahoma, USA [217] . This might have happened due to the trade of the cattle or swine between Italy and the United States. A recent study from China identified IDV sequences which shared a high similarity (99%-100%) with the IDV sequences reported earlier from the cattle in China [102] which was another evidence of bovine to swine transmission of IDV. The IDV has been in circulation in swine in the current decade with reports emerging from swine in Italy, Luxembourg, China and the United States.\n",
            " In summary, IAV was first isolated from a swine in USA in 1930 [34, 349] and later antibodies for the human influenza viruses were reported in swine at the State Prison of New Jersey in 1937 [259] . More IAV outbreaks and cases in swine in North America were reported during 1981-2000; the frequency has now dramatically fallen in the last two decades (Figure 8 ). This might be due to The first report of ICV appeared in Chinese swine after the virus was isolated from apparently healthy swine in 1981 in a routine diagnostic procedure at an abattoir in Beijing [38] .

More IAV outbreaks and cases in swine in North America were reported during 1981-2000; the frequency has now dramatically fallen in the last two decades (Figure 8 ). This might be due to improved swine influenza surveillance and vaccination in North America in recent decades. The H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were reported from the commercial, backyard, exhibition, feral swine and wild boars in the United States.\n",
            " As of February 2020, the highest number of reports of influenza virus infections in swine in a country were documented in the United States (n = 40) followed by China (n = 39) and Canada (n = 24). The highest number of IAV positive swine samples were reported in the United States (36128/200384) followed by China (5031/90760). One of the factors behind the higher number of IAV cases in swine in the United States compared to China would be related to the disease symptoms. A majority of the North American swine samples that were screened for the IAV infections had either mild or severe symptoms of influenza-like illness which would have made it visually easier to identify IAV infected swine in the United States. On the contrary, a smaller number of Chinese swine exhibited influenza-like disease symptoms while a large proportion of the Chinese swine population appeared to have sub-clinical infections with no symptoms. This would have made it difficult for identifying the influenza virus infected swine during surveillances in China.\n",
            " The first report of IDV in 2011 in Oklahoma swine reflected the antigenic diversity and evolution of influenza viruses in the US swine. However, the recent influenza virus disease prevalence in North American swine appeared to have declined, nevertheless, given the large swine population of the continent, the surveillance should continue to track the influenza virus diversity and evolution.\n",
            " The first serological evidence of IAV in European swine was documented from the Czechoslovakia during 1969-1972, but the first H1N1 virus in European swine was isolated in Belgium in 1979 which was apparently transmitted from wild ducks in Germany to the swine in Belgium. Since then several H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been detected in commercial and backyard swine as well as in wild boars within Europe. The incidence of IAV in European swine has increased several folds in the past two decades with a relatively high number of IAV positive swine samples (19644/49814). Most of the IAV positive European swine were reported having influenza-like symptoms at the time of sampling. Germany reported the highest number of IAV positive swine in Europe where the pork industry is considered the third largest globally after China and the United States.\n",
            " Importantly, the IDV was more recently identified in the European swine, first in Italy in 2015, and later a retrospective study identified IDV infection in swine samples collected in Luxembourg during 2014-2015 which indicated that the circulation of IDV in European swine took place only after 2014. The evidence has suggested the bovine to swine transmission of IDV. This observation is interesting because until recently more emphasis has been given to the avian-swine interaction and the bovine-swine interactions have been neglected from the influenza virus spill over perspective.\n",
            " The first occurrence of IAV in Asian swine can be traced back to 1969, but the IAV prevalence has increased multi-fold in the recent two decades. The IAV subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 have become endemic in swine in several Asian countries. The highly pathogenic avian-origin IAV strains of H5N1 and H7N9 have been reported from Chinese swine while H5N1 has been documented in swine in Viet Nam and Indonesia. The highly pathogenic strains of H5N2 have been reported in South Korean swine. Several LPAIV strains including H4N1, H4N6, H4N8, H6N6, H9N2, and H10N5 have also been documented in Chinese swine. The studies suggested a frequent interaction between wild birds and swine in China which appeared to have transmitted avian-origin IAV strains in the Chinese swine. Occurrence of equine influenza virus H3N8 in Chinese swine further expanded the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses. H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were reported from the commercial, backyard, exhibition, feral swine and wild boars in the United States. As of February 2020, the highest number of reports of influenza virus infections in swine in a country were documented in the United States (n = 40) followed by China (n = 39) and Canada (n = 24). The highest number of IAV positive swine samples were reported in the United States Despite an avian to human transmission of certain avian influenza virus strains including H5N1 virus, only a limited human to human transmission of avian influenza viruses was established in the past [350, 351] . With the passage of these avian-origin IAV strains in a mammalian host like swine, a high probability remains of these avian influenza virus strains to adapt and gain the ability of the human to human transmission, if happens, the consequences would be devastating for the public health.\n",
            " Australian swine were free from influenza virus until the year 2009 when a New South Wales swine farm reported an influenza-like outbreak in the swine. The zoonotic transmission of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was reported to the farm workers and the farm owner. Until now, there have only been four IAV reports in Australian swine which reflects a low prevalence of IAV in Australian swine. New Zealand is yet to officially report the influenza virus prevalence in swine and remains free from the disease.\n",
            " A retrospective study identified that the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was present in Mexican swine as early as 2000, well before the influenza pandemic occurred during March-May 2009. A high genetic diversity of IAV in Mexican swine due to live swine imports from North America and Europe during 1980s laid the foundation of the emergence of zoonotic strain of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Mexican swine [33] . The highest number of IAV positive swine in Central America were reported from Mexico followed by Guatemala. Interestingly, a report of the highly pathogenic H5N2 virus in Mexican swine in 2018 further triggers the alarm in the context of a potential novel IAV reassortment. Outbreaks of IAV in the South American swine populations occurred during the last two decades, with the highest prevalence reported in the Brazilian swine. A considerable proportion of cases showed sub-clinical infections with no symptoms which might have made it more difficult to detect the infected swine.\n",
            " The reports of IAV active infections or the seroprevalence appeared in the African swine only during last two decades. Until February 2020, IAV have been detected in swine in Cameroon, Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, Reunion Island, Uganda, Togo, and Ghana. However, South Africa has a considerable swine population [352] , but currently there is no published report on the prevalence of active IAV or other influenza virus infections in the South African swine. This might be because of the lack of an active surveillance for the detection of the influenza virus disease in the swine in South Africa.\n",
            " The reports of reassortant, double-reassortant and triple-reassortant influenza viruses in Asian, North American and European swine strengthens the concept of swine being the \"mixing vessel\" in terms of influenza virus reassortment and evolution. The multiple reports of avian-origin IAV strains including highly pathogenic H5N1, H5N2 and H7N9 in swine are alarming given the fact that the avian-origin strains may adapt in swine to facilitate the emergence of a reassortant pandemic strain. The highest number of influenza virus studies in swine population have been reported from the United States (n = 40) followed by China (n = 39). Also, the United States reported the highest numbers of IAV cases in swine. Due to widespread active surveillance, the United States has significantly brought down the influenza virus disease in swine in the last two decades. Conversely, the IAV disease burden has increased multi-fold in Chinese swine in the last two decades. Additionally, the occurrence of several high-and low-pathogenic avian-origin IAV strains in the Chinese swine population may put the country at greater risk of an influenza pandemic for the future. Given the \"mixing vessel\" nature of swine physiology, the occurrence of several avian-origin IAV strains and multiple reports of double-reassortant and triple-reassortant IAV subtypes in Chinese swine are alarming because reassortments in swine may facilitate the emergence of a new IAV strain of pandemic potential.\n",
            " In the background of the current Corona virus pandemic (COVID-19) which originated in China, the presence of avian-origin IAV strains in Chinese swine must be considered a serious threat for the future and hence must be dealt accordingly. An active nationwide swine surveillance similar to that of North America which as a result, has brought down the current prevalence of influenza virus in the North American swine, should be in place in the rest of the world to safeguard the public health and the economics of the swine farming. A better and active worldwide swine influenza surveillance would be useful for upgrading the current diagnostic protocols and vaccines to prevent future influenza virus outbreaks.\n"

            "Body Text: Dormancy, such as hibernation in mammals [1, 2] , diapause of insects and zooplankton [3] , as well as the soil seed banks [4, 5] , is a widespread and efficient adaptive strategy for populations under environmental fluctuation. Various types of dormancy are also a common form of stress response in bacteria including sporulation of Gram-positive bacteria [6] [7] [8] . The evolutionary stability of dormancy has been investigated under varying environments [3, 9, 10] , as well as under the environment with minimal abiotic fluctuations [3] . However, the dormant form of an organism is much more costly compared with the active form in the course of evolution, due to its inability to breed and the large energy consumption during resting egg production as is the case for many invertebrates, such as zooplankton [11, 12] .\n",
            " Hence, dormancy has become a topic of major interest in evolutionary biology: why does dormancy persist and remain a competitive evolutionary strategy? Previous studies have shown the advantage of predator dormancy when two types of predators compete for a single resource [13, 14] . This phenomenon was first experimentally discovered by [15] and subsequently analyzed by [16] . They found that large-amplitude fluctuations can be avoided by predator dormancy in the predator-prey dynamic population model, explaining the paradox of enrichment [17] [18] [19] . However, the effect of prey dormancy has not been studied: how will dormancy affect the prey, and can prey dormancy also suppress largeamplitude fluctuation?\n",
            " In order to identify the factors that determine whether prey remains active or goes into dormancy, it is necessary to quantify the competition among prey. Under the high density of predators, the conditions are harsh for prey because they have to avoid being foraged by numerous predators. Under these conditions, the ability to enter dormancy will be beneficial to the prey allowing it to reduce its consumption and breeding, as well as the probability of being discovered. In contrast, the prey will remain active to promote population growth under a low density of predators. Furthermore, dormancy is beneficial for prey (actually, for any organism) under large-amplitude environmental fluctuation, especially under harsh environmental conditions, but not in a safe, stable environment. Recently, it has been shown that environmentally destructive populations can survive by switching between \"nomadic\" and \"colonial\" forms [20] [21] [22] . Predator dormancy also allows the predator to survive in the large-amplitude fluctuation [14] . In these models, one form grows rapidly but depletes the environment (which includes prey in the case of predator and host in the case of a parasite), whereas the other one does not affect the environment but decays. Each of these strategies individually results in extinction, but combined, they can ensure the survival of the population. Therefore, these models exhibit Parrondo's paradox, an abstraction of the phenomenon of flashing Brownian ratchets [23] [24] [25] , where a winning outcome can be achieved by alternating between two losing strategies [26] [27] [28] [29] .\n",
            " Inspired by the previous analyses of the predator-prey model, we propose a population dynamic model to investigate the competition between two forms of prey with different settings under predation. The two forms of dormitive prey y 1 and y 2 are both losing strategies compared with the perennially active (PA) prey p with superior traits. Indeed, the active form of the dormitive prey y 1 has a lower growth rate than the PA prey, spending energy on dormant offspring rather than foraging, and thus loses; the dormant form y 2 is also a losing strategy due to its low growth rate and inability to grow on its own. In the game-theoretic perspective, these two strategies cannot individually compete with the PA prey. However, alternating between these two losing strategies allows the dormitive prey to gain an advantage in the competition. This result recapitulates the phenomenon of Parrondo's paradox. An additional unexpected finding is that the dormitive prey, which generally would be assumed to be more effective under harsh environmental conditions, in this model, has a higher fitness in richer environments. This outcome is determined by the high density of predators and the large-amplitude fluctuations.\n",
            " The competition between different forms of prey and the effect of dormancy\n",
            " We develop a population dynamic model to explore the competition between the two types of prey under predation (Eqs. 1, 2, and 3). The differences between the two types of prey are that (1) the PA prey p has a higher growth rate r p and (2) the dormitive prey has two forms (active form y 1 and dormant form y 2 ) which are determined by dormancy switching function μ(z) and dormancy termination rate α. In general, the prey with a higher growth rate will dominate and survive for a long time in the environment under predation. Hence, the density of the predator z is one of the vital parameters for the competition of prey. Especially, the predator density determines the dormancy switching in our model such that there is more dormant form under a higher predator density but more active form under a lower density of predators. Here, we assume that the density of the dormant form of the dormitive prey does not contribute to the density-dependent growth, and the mortality rate is a constant for the predator. In gametheoretic terms, the active form y 1 and dormant form y 2 of the dormitive prey are both losing strategies compared with the PA prey p because (1) the active form has a lower growth rate and spends extra energy to produce dormant offspring and (2) the dormant form also has a lower growth rate and cannot support population growth on its own. However, will the dormitive prey with a lower growth rate but capable of entering dormancy under harsh environmental conditions overtake the PA prey and win the competition in the environment? The detailed descriptions, the initial values, and the units of parameters and functions used in our model, which were obtained from published real-world data [11, 14, [30] [31] [32] , are given in Table 1 .\n",
            " In the first competition scenario, we assume that the active form or the dormant form of the dormitive prey competes with the PA prey individually (Fig. 1A, B) , under different initial population densities, dormancy termination rates α, and dormancy switching functions μ(z). In this case, y 2 equals 0 ( Fig. 1A) , and y 1 equals 0 ( Fig. 1B) individually. In this competition, the active form of the dormitive prey is disadvantaged compared with the PA prey and eventually goes extinct (t = 40) due to its low growth rate (Fig. 1A) , whereas the dormant form of the dormitive prey becomes extinct already in the first wave because it cannot sustain population growth on its own (Fig. 1B) . Thus, both forms are losing strategies for the dormitive prey, so that the PA prey outcompetes y under all conditions. In this competition, the interaction between the PA prey and the predator follows the Rosenzweig-MacArthur criterion [33] .\n",
            " In the next competition scenario, we assume that the dormitive prey can switch between the active and dormant forms (Fig. 1C ) due to the setting of μ(z). In this case, the PA prey is dominant at the beginning (t ∈ [0, 320]) thanks to its high growth rate r p . However, the PA prey cannot support the high density of predators. At high density, the predator will forage for a large number of the PA prey, causing its extinction, because it has no recourse to an evasive strategy (dormancy). Thus, it begins to decline after t = 200 and becomes extinct at t = 380. Then, the dormitive prey overtakes the PA prey and gradually evolves towards a steady state of coexistence with the predator. There are more active forms at lower density of the predator and more dormant forms under higher density of predators because of the setting of μ(z). The density of the active form is similar to the density of the PA prey, which is determined by the carrying capacity K. In order to examine the dynamics of different populations more closely, a cycle of the dynamic process (t ∈ [400, 450]) is enlarged (Fig. 1D) . The peaks of different populations do not occur at the same time. Specifically, the peak time of y 2 occurs between the peak times of y 1 and z. In addition, the growth rate of the dormant form of the dormitive prey around t = 420 is higher than the rate during t ∈ [410, 418], which is determined by the growth term r y ð1− pþy 1 K Þð 1−μðzÞÞy 1 . During t ∈ [410, 418], the growth of the dor- Table 1 The descriptions, values, and units of parameters and functions used in the model (from recent real-world data [11, 14, [30] [31] [32] mant form is mainly due to the increasing density of the active form of the dormitive prey, causing the increase of ð 1− pþy 1 K Þy 1 , under the logistic growth model. However, after t = 418, the density of the active form begins to drop and the density of the predator begins to increase, and therefore, the growth rate of the dormant form is higher than before because of the rapid increase in 1 − μ(z) (Eq. 3). After t = 420, the growth rate is slower than the foraging rate, so the dormant form of the dormitive prey declines and the predator reaches its peak.\n",
            " Impact of the carrying capacity on the outcome of the competition As the carrying capacity K increases, there will be more prey, causing a higher density of predators. However, our previous results show that the PA prey cannot support the high density of the predator and thus becomes extinct. Hence, the impact of the carrying capacity on the competition between the two types of prey should be studied. Compared with K = 11 (Fig. 1C) , the dormitive prey will take advantage earlier at K = 13 ( Fig. 2A) . The PA prey cannot reach its peak (near carrying capacity) under these conditions and will begin to decline at a point where it still has an apparent potential to rise. This is the case because the current density of prey already results in high predator density such that the prey cannot reach the environmental capacity due to the high rate of predation. However, the predator grows faster than before thanks to the availability of adequate resources, so the PA prey will become extinct quickly because of the lack of an evasive strategy. The first time when the peak density of the active form of the dormitive prey is higher than the peak density of the PA prey is called the reversal time T w . The reversal time T w is 195.1 in this case ( Fig. 2A) , that is, reversal occurs earlier than it does at K = 11. When K continues to rise to 20 (Fig. 2B) , the reversal time further shortens, to T w = 89.2. In addition, the peak density of the active form of the dormitive prey is also higher than for the previous conditions and comes close to the carrying capacity. In contrast, when K decreases to 9 (Fig. 2C) , the PA prey is at an advantage because the density of the predator is lower than it is at larger K. This allows the PA prey to grow in the environment and avoid extinction. The peak density of the PA prey is also close to K = 9, the same as discussed before. At a high predator density, the PA prey will be extensively foraged and will eventually go extinct. In contrast, the dormitive prey can enter dormancy to survive at a high density of the predator, which is a competitive survival strategy. Hence, the dormant form is advantageous to the prey under population fluctuation in the apparent competition [34] . The reversal time T w changes rapidly when the carrying capacity K is low but stays nearly constant at high K (Fig. 2D) .\n",
            " We further explored the parameter space of the model to determine how the dormitive prey gains advantage under different conditions. The outcomes were evaluated by the highest density of each competitor during t ∈ [2800, 3000] (stable competition). Due to the impracticality of all-vs-all parameter comparison, the parameters were analyzed in pairs as follows. Table 1 unless stated otherwise. The initial population density is [2, 2, 0, 1]. A Carrying capacity K equals 13. B Carrying capacity K equals 20, causing higher density of each population and shorter reversal time T w compared to the case that K equals 13. C Carrying capacity K equals 9, the PA prey wins the competition. D The relationship between the reversal time T w and carrying capacity K. Fig. 3 The parameter space of population traits that determines which type of prey can achieve a higher abundance, recapitulating the phenomenon of Parrondo's paradox. The parameter values are from Table 1 unless stated otherwise. A, B Joint impact of carrying capacity K, dormancy termination rate α, and predator death rate d z on prey density when two types of prey are under predation. C, D Joint impact of parameters in the dormancy switching function μ(z) on prey density when two types of prey are under predation, including the lower bound χ, range φ, switching threshold η, and width σ. E, F The relationships between the predator and two types of prey, including the growth efficiencies k q and foraging efficiencies c q , are compared The carrying capacity K was first compared with the dormancy termination rate α (Fig. 3A) . When K is low, the PA prey reaches a higher abundance than the active form of the dormitive prey, no matter how α changes. This is because there are not enough predators to consume resources (prey) under low K, thus avoiding the extinction of the PA prey. However, as K increases, a large number of predators will forage for the PA prey, leading to its extinction. In this case, the active form of the dormitive prey gains advantage under medium values of α, because both the high and low α only allow a single form of dormitive prey to exist, which are losing strategies compared with the PA prey (Fig. 1A, B) . The carrying capacity K is then compared with the predator death rate d z (Fig. 3B) . With the increase of K, the density of both types of prey will increase, the same as the result in Fig. 3A . At low K, only small values of d z allow the active form of the dormitive prey to win because only the dormitive prey can survive under the high density of predators in this case. There will be more prey in the environment with higher K, leading to many predators; thus, the PA prey can only win under higher values of d z (fewer predators) as shown above. Hence, there is only a narrow range of d z for the PA prey to dominate in the environment under high K, but a wide range of d z under low K.\n",
            " Four parameters in the dormancy switching function μ(z) were then compared because of the importance of switching for the dormitive prey. The lower bound χ and range φ determine how many preys remain active and how many go dormant (Fig. 3C) . The values of χ and φ obey the condition 0 ≤ χ ≤ χ + φ ≤ 1, which means that the value of the dormancy switching function should be between 0 and 1. We find that the active form of the dormitive prey can only gain advantage when χ is relatively low (χ ≤ 0.6) and χ + φ is close to 1. χ cannot be too large because the prey needs a certain amount of active form to provide the growth capacity in all cases; otherwise, the dormitive prey will go extinct. The reason why χ + φ ≈ 1 is to ensure full reproduction under safe conditions, so that the dormitive prey can survive under environmental fluctuations. In the comparison of switching threshold η and width σ in μ(z) (Fig. 3D) , the dormitive prey can reach a higher abundance than the PA prey with low σ because of the sharp switching. The sharp switching between the active and dormant form results in a strong fitness to the environment, allowing the disadvantaged prey to win in the competition.\n",
            " The relationships between the predator and two types of prey are further studied. The comparison between the predator growth efficiencies from the active form k p ; k y 1 and the efficiency from the dormant form k y 2 (Fig. 3E) shows that k y 2 does not affect the result of the competition. Higher k p and k y 1 will cause more predators in the environment, resulting in the winning outcome of the active form of the dormitive prey (similar results in Fig. 3B) . We assume the foraging efficiencies c y 2 ≤c p and c y 2 ≤ c y 1 in Fig. 3F because the dormant form is less likely to be found and thus avoids predation. There will be more predators under higher c p and c y 1 , and thus, it can be concluded that the dormitive prey will win in this case (same reason as in Fig. 3B ).\n",
            " Analysis of the present model shows that the dormitive prey can outcompete the PA prey with superior traits by switching between the active and dormant forms. The counterintuitive results obtained here are that (1) the dormitive prey with lower growth rate and extra energy loss can overtake the PA prey and win the competition and (2) prey dormancy is advantageous in rich environments (high carrying capacity), whereas intuitively, it could be expected to gain advantage in poor environments. These surprising outcomes of the competition can be explained through Parrondo's paradox: alternation of two losing strategies can result in a winning strategy. In this model, both the active form and the dormant form of the dormitive prey are individually disadvantaged in the competition against the PA prey because (1) the active form of the dormitive prey has a lower growth rate and spends extra energy to produce dormant offspring, and (2) the dormant form also has a lower growth rate and cannot support population growth on its own (Fig. 1A, B) . However, a winning outcome for the dormitive prey can be achieved by alternating between the active form and the dormant form (Fig.  1C ). This result can be explained by Parrondo's paradox [35] [36] [37] . Parrondo's paradox also might be applicable to other biological competitions. For example, bacteriophages can switch between active reproduction (hostdestroying lytic phase) and dormancy (lysogenic phase) depending on the state of the external environment [38] , and the dormancy of phages (lysogeny) can be considered an adaptation to host population oscillations.\n",
            " Under a high carrying capacity, a high density of prey is reached by logistic growth [39] , thereby supporting a high density of predators. However, the high density of predators will lead to the extinction of the PA prey because the latter has no recourse to dormancy as an evasive strategy ( Fig. 2A, B) . Hence, the dormitive prey has higher fitness under higher carrying capacity (higher density of predators). Furthermore, the higher the carrying capacity, the sooner (smaller value of the reversal time T w ) the dormitive prey will gain advantage and overtake (Fig. 2D ) because predators will grow faster and forage more PA prey. In contrast, the PA prey will gain advantage under the low peak density of predators (Fig.  2C ) because it can support the predator population at this low density. Therefore, the density of predators (determined by the carrying capacity in our model) is the key factor that determines the outcome of the competition between the two types of prey [34, 40] . This allows us to interpret the second counterintuitive result: prey dormancy is advantageous in richer environments. The resource-rich environment not only increases the density of the prey, but also causes the large-amplitude population (predator-prey) cycles and high density of predators due to the prey oversupply, followed by over-predation [15, 17] . The dormant form of prey can survive under the high density of predators in the population cycles to come back subsequently, whereas the PA prey goes extinct in the cycles. Furthermore, no matter which prey has the advantage in the competition, the peak density of prey is higher in a richer environment, approaching the carrying capacity and causing large amplitude cycles, which is beneficial to the dormitive prey.\n",
            " The large-amplitude population cycles have been explored in diverse real-world cases, such as the relationship between Daphnia and plankton [15, 41] , Arctic lemmings and weasels [42] , parasites and mountain hares [43] , and intraspecific competition of Antarctic krill [44] . These results show the effect of over-predation and potential applications of Parrondo's paradox [45, 46] . The large-amplitude fluctuations are usually accompanied by the extinction of populations [16, 17] , but dormancy allows the prey to survive the fluctuation, with a subsequent comeback. Thus, our key finding is that the dormitive prey can gain advantage and overtake in the competition under large-amplitude fluctuations. Indeed, prey dormancy has been observed in a variety of predator-prey systems including bacteria (Myxococcus as predator and Bacillus as prey) [47] [48] [49] ; arthropods-spider mites [50, 51] ; and small rodents-dormice [52, 53] .\n",
            " An obvious limitation of this work is that, because of the wide variation of the parameters of predator and prey populations, the dynamics derived from the real-world data [11, 14, [30] [31] [32] might substantially differ from those predicted by the model. Nevertheless, we explored in detail the impact of multiple parameter combinations on the competition outcome. In particular, this analysis shows that the parameter values that cause a higher density of predators, such as lower death rate, higher predator growth efficiencies, and higher foraging efficiencies, will lead to the extinction of the PA prey. In addition, the range of dormancy termination rates ensuring the winning outcome for the dormitive prey is determined by the carrying capacity, which can also affect the density of predators. The parameters in the threshold-induced dormancy function also need to be in a suitable range for the dormitive prey to win the competition.\n",
            " The analysis of the present model indicates that the counterintuitive winning outcome for the dormitive prey is underlain by the game-theoretic Parrondo's paradox. In the large-amplitude fluctuation, dormancy can help the dormitive prey to outcompete the PA prey with superior traits and even cause the extinction of the PA prey. Parrondo's paradox is likely to be widely applicable to other biological competitions with large-amplitude fluctuations.\n",
            " In the dynamic population model, we introduce an additional prey population (y) to the existing predator-prey model, adapted from the Lotka-Volterra-derived model of Rosenzweig and MacArthur [33, 54, 55] . In detail, two prey populations (p, y) are both preyed on by the predator population (z). p is the density of PA prey, and y = y 1 + y 2 is the density of dormitive prey, with y 1 and y 2 corresponding to the active and dormant subpopulations, respectively. Here, we assume that (1) the dormant form of the dormitive prey is sterile, (2) the dormant form does not contribute to density-dependent growth regulation, and (3) density-dependence applies to growth but not to mortality. The differential equations of this proposed model are:\n",
            " Þy 1 −αy 2 − f y 2 y 2 ð Þz;\n",
            " z ¼ k p f p p ð Þz þ k y 1 f y 1 y 1 ð Þz þ k y 2 f y 2 y 2 ð Þz−d z z:\n",
            " Two types of prey follow the logistic growth model [56] with the environment carrying capacity K and different maximum growth rates (r p , r y ), as well as the predation from the predator at rates f p (p), f y 1 ðy 1 Þ , and f y 2 ðy 2 Þ (Eq. 2). The active form is also supplemented by the dormant form at the termination rate α, and only a fraction of energy, μ(z), is used for the active descendant of the dormitive prey. Therefore, the remaining fraction, 1 − μ(z), is used for the dormant progeny. The predator grows in proportion to the growth efficiencies (k p , k y 1 , k y 2 ) and predation rates (f p (p), f y (y 1 ), f y 2 ðy 2 Þ), while dying at rate d z . Recent published real-world data [11, 14, [30] [31] [32] shown in Table 1 are used to validate our proposed dynamic model. These data have been applied to describe the traits of prey and predator in the competition from the zooplankton modeling literature. Numerical simulations were implemented by the ode23 function in MATLAB that is an implementation of an explicit Runge-Kutta (2,3) pair of Bogacki and Shampine [57] . The accuracy of the simulation is ensured by the strict tolerance level in the repeated experiment, which makes the final coefficient not change significantly and less than 1%. In the simulation, the relative error tolerance and absolute error tolerance are both 10 −8 .\n",

            "Body Text: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) belongs to the genus Phlebovirus and family Bunyaviridae. RVFV is composed of a tripartite singlestranded RNA genome with large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments [1, 2, 3, 4] . RVFV particles have icosahedral symmetry and are 90-110 nm in diameter [4] . The envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer that is embedded with the Gn and Gc glycoproteins. These glycoproteins, which are the most exposed components of the virus during infection, play a crucial role in the entry of the virus into the host cell.\n",
            " RVFV is a highly pathogenic arthropod-borne virus that is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, particularly after heavy rainfall. Although it can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, RVFV primarily affects livestock and humans [2] . Animals are infected through mosquito bites and other arthropod vectors. Humans are typically affected when they come in close contact with infected bodily fluids or tissues, but transmission via mosquito bites, as well as aerosolization may also occur. However, humans are dead-end hosts [1, 5] .\n",
            " Since being first identified in 1930 in the Rift Valley of Kenya, outbreaks have led to high mortality rates as well as significant economic loss [3] . RVFV has remained endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, causing major outbreaks throughout the continent over the last century [6] . In 1976, 200,000 individuals were infected and 600 fatal cases were reported in Egypt [5] . Most likely due to international livestock trade, it has since crossed the Arabian Peninsula into Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Over 30 mosquito species, mostly Aedes and Culex are vectors for RVFV [5] . Of particular concern is that the Aedes species is widely distributed in the EU countries and many of those countries (Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and France) have high-risk vector habitat areas that may serve as emergent sites. Moreover, in the Unites States, this species has been found in 23 states [7] . Since RVFV is capable of utilizing a wide range of mosquito vectors, the virus has the potential to spread further into non-endemic areas [5, 8] .\n",
            " Mortality rates are dependent on species and age. In livestock, mortality rates are as high as 30%. Mortality rates can reach as high as 95% in newborns and the young, while abortion rates are as high as 100% [5] . Symptoms in humans are usually mild and include febrile illness resembling the flu, with a small percentage developing serious clinical manifestations such as retinal lesions, meningoencephalitis, hepatitis, severe hemorrhagic fever, coma and death. In recent years an increase in mortality amongst humans from 2% to 45% has been reported, suggesting evolving mechanisms of virulence and mutations [3] .\n",
            " Due to its transmission via aerosolization, high pathogenicity, and classification as a Group III (bioterrorism potential) Category A emerging infectious disease by the NIAID, work with RVFV requires BSL-3 containment. It is highly suggested that laboratory staff working with RVFV be vaccinated. Therefore, diagnosis of RVFV is restricted to a small number of laboratories. This limitation has led to some delay in diagnostics associated with virus isolation and identification techniques that may pose a problem for healthcare authorities in the event of an RVFV epidemic. There is a crucial need for rapid detection and identification of the virus [3, 5] .\n",
            " NanoTrap particles are a novel technology that can address all the critical analytical challenges for pathogen identification and measurement. They are homogenous hydrogel particles of about 800 nanometers in size that have a shell made of polymers of Nisopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and co-monomers such as acrylic acid (AAc) and allylamine (AA) with cross links of N,N9methylenebisacrylamide (BIS). This shell can be modified to alter permeability or porosity by increasing or decreasing the percentage of BIS [9, 10] . Charge-based affinity baits are incorporated into the NanoTrap particles by copolymerization and covalent binding to the shell [10] . The NanoTrap particles are temperature-and pH-sensitive, decreasing in size with increased temperature and low pH. The molecular sieving properties of the particles depend on several aspects. The degree of cross-linking within the particles provides inclusion and exclusion of high abundance large molecules (e.g. albumin). Affinity baits further facilitate the capture and concentration of the target protein, and prevent it from exiting the particle. They may be of negative or positive charge, therefore attracting analytes of opposite charge. This was seen in an early experiment performed by Luchini et al. where the incubation of particles containing anionic affinity baits captured myoglobin, a protein with a positive charge [9] . Some NanoTrap particles are composed of NIPAm shells, and a few of these shelled NanoTrap particles are also coated with vinyl sulfonic acid (VSA) [11] . NanoTrap particles are able to perform three functions in one step: molecular size sieving, target analyte affinity sequestration, and complete protection of captured analytes from degradation. Furthermore, NanoTrap particles help to bridge the gap between detection and the limits of sensitivity. Mass spectrometry (specifically liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry) is a favored technique for the discovery of candidate biomarkers in biological fluids. However, this technique only accepts a small input volume and complex solutions often lead to decreased sensitivity. The NanoTrap particles concentrate protein analytes in small volumes to effectively amplify the sensitivity of mass spectrometry. In addition, their promiscuity allows for multiple analytes to be harvested from a single sample [9] . Experiments conducted by Luchini et al. demonstrated the capture and enrichment of small molecules spiked in complex solutions such as whole blood and serum [9, 10] . A 2011 study by Douglas et al. on the detection of Lyme disease demonstrated that NanoTrap particles can improve sensitivity more than 100-fold (over existing methods) as well as lead to 100 percent capture and 100 percent elution yield of low abundance antigens in biofluids. Lyme disease antigens at low abundance were detected in both urine samples as well as from a single infected tick [12] .\n",
            " The current library of commercially available NanoTrap particles has been designed to specifically harvest proteins, peptides, metabolites and small molecules. We hypothesized that NanoTrap particles would be able to capture whole virus through the interaction of the NanoTrap particle with the positively charged residues on the surface of RVFV. Our study demonstrates that NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing whole virus, and can be assayed with both qRT-PCR and plaque assays. Importantly, serial dilution studies and studies in serum indicate that NanoTrap particles increase detection sensitivity at lower viral titers. Furthermore, the virus can be inactivated with either heat or detergent, while the virus captured can still be detected with qRT-PCR. Importantly, the NanoTrap particles protect purified viral RNA as well as stabilize the infectivity of RVFV. The studies described here expand upon the NanoTrap particles repertoire to characterize the capture of viruses.\n",

We were not only able to capture and detect RVFV at very low titers from both media and serum, but we were also able to inactivate the virus, which allows for its safe transport to BSL-2 laboratories. While there are other commercially available beads that can also capture virus, NanoTrap particles are the only beads that can protect the viral RNA from enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that whole virus detection with NanoTrap particles is not limited to only RVFV, but that NanoTrap particles can be used to detect other viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV).\n",
            " (DMEM+++). The J1.1 cell line, which are Jurkat E6.1 suspension cells chronically infected with the LA1 strain of HIV-1, were grown in medium containing advanced RPMI-1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine. All cell lines were cultured in a humidified environment containing 5% CO 2 at 37uC.\n",
            " The experiments used a live attenuated vaccine derived from the RVFV ZH548 strain, known as MP-12, which had been isolated in 1977 from a patient with uncomplicated RVFV. The virus was generated by 12 serial passages in MRC5 cells, inducing 25 nucleotide changes across the viral genome [13] . Both RVFV ZH548 and MP12 strains were anonymized. MP12 was propagated by infecting Vero cells at 80-90% confluency at an MOI of 0.1 in DMEM+++. Cell culture medium was collected from the cells when ,75% cytopathic effect was observed (typically 72 hours post-infection (hpi)). Cell culture medium was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet the cellular debris. Cell free-viral supernatants were then filtered using a 0.22 mM filter and viral titer determined by plaque assays. Screening experiments for Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) used the live attenuated vaccine TC-83, which had been derived from the Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain by 83 serial passages in fetal guinea pig hearts. This induced changes at 12 nucleotide positions across the viral genome [14] . The viral supernatant of chronically infected J1.1 cells was used in the HIV-1 screening experiments. The LAV strain of HIV-1 had previously been used to infected Jurkat E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 to 0.01 for 2 hours at 27uC and cultured for two weeks. The cells that survived the cytopathic effects of virus infection were cloned and the supernatant from growth-positive wells were screened for Reverse Transcriptase (RT) activity [15] . The J1.1 cells express viral RNA and proteins at low levels.\n",
            " Six commercially available beads -DEAE-Sephadex (Sigma-Aldrich), Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen), Sephacryl S-200 beads (GE Healthcare), Biorex 70 Resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories), SP Sephadex C-25 (GE Healthcare), and Bio-gel HTP Hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad Laboratories) were used to compare their capture to NT53. Each bead was washed four times with water and a 33% percent slurry with water was prepared.\n",
            " According to a protocol standardized by Ceres Nanoscience, 100 microliters (mL) of sample was incubated with 75 mL of NanoTrap particles for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed with 100 mL of RNase-and DNase-free water four times. The pellet was then resuspended in the appropriate buffer. For lysis of MP12 with NP-40, 1% NP-40 was added to 100 ml of MP12 and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. A standard NanoTrap particle incubation was performed followed by a qRT-PCR assay. For the RNase treatment, purified MP12 RNA was treated with RNase A and incubated for one hour at 37uC.\n",
            " Vero cells were plated in 6 well plates at 1.0E+06 cells/ml in order to achieve 100% confluency. After NanoTrap particle incubation and subsequent washes, the pellet was resuspended in 100 mL of supplemented DMEM and serial dilutions performed. Four hundred mL of the serial dilution was added to each well in duplicate and incubated for 1 hour. Three hundred milliliters (mL) of a primary overlay known as the CV mixture containing equal parts 0.6% agarose in distilled water and media containing 2X EMEM, 5% FBS, 1% Minimum Essential Amino Acids, 1% Sodium Pyruvate, and 1% Glutamax was added directly to each well. The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in water after 72 hpi. The cells were stained with 1% Crystal Violet in 20% ethanol and water. After two hours, the crystal violet stain was washed off and the plaques formed were counted to determine the plaque forming units per milliliter (pfu/ml).\n",
            " After NanoTrap particle incubation and subsequent washes, the pellet was resuspended in 180 mL of lysis/binding solution (Life Technologies) containing guanidinium thiocyanate and incubated on ice for thirty minutes. The samples were spun at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate and RNA extraction was performed with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions. In order to determine the number of viral genomic copies produced, qRT-PCR with viral specific primers was performed using RNA UltraSense One-\n",
            " Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Life Technologies). The experiment was performed according to a standardized protocol using fifteen mL of master mix containing enzyme mix, 5X reaction mix, 50 mM magnesium sulfate (excluded for VEEV qRT PCR), ROX reference dye, 10 mM TaqMan fluorogenic probe, 10 mM forward primer (AAAGGAACAATG-GACTCTGGTCA), and 10 uM reverse primer (CACTTCT-TACTACCATGTCCTCCAAT) added to five mL of extracted RNA. The samples were heated at 50uC for 15 minutes, 95uC for 2 minutes, and at 95uC and 60uC for 40 cycles.\n",
            " RVFV was spiked into 100% bovine, sheep, and donkey serum (purchased from Innovative Research) at 1.0E+05 pfu/ml. One mL of spiked serum was used in a standard NanoTrap particle incubation with NT53.\n",
            " After a standard NanoTrap incubation was performed with NT53 and RVFV, the samples were incubated at room temperature with 0.1, 0.5, or 1% NP-40 for 1 hour or heated at 57uC for 0.5, 1, or 2 hours. The samples were then analyzed by plaque assays and qRT PCR.\n",
            " A standard NanoTrap particle incubation with one mL of HIV-1 supernatant from infected J1.1 cells and NanoTrap particles was performed. An RNA extraction was performed (as described above). A master mix was then prepared with the following components for a 25 mL reaction: SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq Mix -0.5 mL, 2X Reaction Mix with ROX -12.5 mL, and 0.5 mL of Forward and Reverse Primer Mix (LTR forward primer CGAGCTTGCTACAAGGGACT and LTR reverse primer GAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAG) at 10 mM. Five mL of sample, 6.5 mL of water, and 13.5 mL of master mix were aliquoted out into PCR tubes. The PCR was conducted with the following cycles: 15 min at 50uC (cDNA synthesis), 2 min at 95uC (prime reaction), and 35 cycles at 30 seconds at 95uC (denature), 30 seconds at 51uC (annealing), 30 seconds at 72uC (extend), 72uC for 10 min, and a hold at 4uC. A DNA gel was prepared using 1% agarose powder in 1X TAE buffer with the addition of ethidium bromide for a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The gel was visualized on an ultraviolet transilluminator and the volume of each band was quantified.\n",
            " NanoTrap particles can capture whole virus NanoTrap particles have previously been shown to capture proteins. We hypothesized that the RVFV glycoproteins would be Figure 1 . RVFV capture by NanoTrap particles. A) Seven different types of NanoTrap particles were incubated with viral supernatants containing RVFV (1E+7 pfu/ml) for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed 4 times with water. Viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR assays. B) Percent detected virus was calculated compared to a sample processed without NanoTrap particle incubation. C) Viral supernatants were incubated with NT46, NT53, and NT69 for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed 4 times with water. Serial dilutions followed by plaque assays were performed to determine if full virus was bound by the particles. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g001 capable of interacting with the NanoTrap particles, facilitating capture in a fashion similar to the way in which protein biomarkers interacted with the NanoTrap particles. To test this hypothesis, seven different NanoTrap particles were tested with RVFV. Four NanoTrap particles possessed shells (NT53, NT55, NT69, and NT71) whereas three did not (NT45, NT46, and NT75) ( Table 1) . We incubated culture supernatants from RVFVinfected Veros with each NanoTrap particle. All seven NanoTrap particles successfully captured virus, averaging 6.8E+07 genomic copies per reaction. Specifically, NT46, NT53, and NT69 captured higher genomic copies than the other NanoTrap particles, with each capturing approximately 1.0E+08 genomic copies per reaction ( Figure 1A ). This corresponds to 78-83% capture ( Figure 1B) of a sample containing a high titer of virus.\n",
            " In order to determine if the amplification observed in the qRT-PCR assay was due to the NanoTrap particle capturing intact viral particles or association of viral RNA (presumably due to lysed virus) with the particles, plaque assays were performed. If the particles captured viral RNA or lysed virus, no plaques should be observed. Plaque assays were performed on the three best candidates from the qRT-PCR screening. Captured viruses were not eluted off of the NanoTrap particles, but rather the samples were diluted and added directly to the Vero cells during the plaque assay procedure. We hypothesized that the viral glycoproteins would have a greater affinity for the cellular receptor than the NanoTrap particles and thus would enter the cells. NT53, which contains a cibacron blue bait with a shell, captured infectious RVFV virion six-and four-fold more than NT46 or NT69, respectively ( Figure 1C ). These plaques were not due to cell death induced by the NanoTrap particles themselves, as NanoTrap particles alone did not produce plaques. Therefore NT53 was chosen for all future experiments with RVFV.\n",
            " Experiments were performed to determine potential elution methods that would release the virus without affecting the viral particle integrity. It had previously been found that sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations between 0.5M and 2M could effectively elute various analytes from cibacron blue dyes by disrupting electrostatic interactions between cibacron blue dyes (the bait molecule found within NT53; [16] ). We hypothesized that incubating the RVFV-bound NanoTrap particles on ice would allow the particles to swell and, with the aid of vortexing, the virus would disassociate from the NanoTrap particles. Therefore, we tested a NaCl based elution method coupled with an ice-swelling method. Plaque assays were performed to determine the amount of virus eluted from the NanoTrap particles and the amount that remained bound to the particles after a high salt elution. After NT53 incubation with RVFV, the pellets were resuspended in 2.0 M NaCl in DMEM and placed on ice for 30 minutes with vortexing every ten minutes. Both the eluates and pellets were analyzed by plaque assay ( Figure S1 ). The results showed that 5.5% of RVFV was detected after elution with 2.0M NaCl. The addition of NaCl coupled with incubation on ice only slightly released RVFV virions, demonstrating the virus' strong affinity for the NanoTrap particles. However, as seen in Figure 1B , RVFV-bound NanoTrap pellets directly added to Vero cells during the plaque assays procedure were capable of producing plaques. Based on these results, we opted not to elute RVFV from the NanoTrap particles, but rather to add the RVFV bound to the NanoTrap particles directly during the plaque assay procedure.\n",
            " We next wanted to determine the limit of detection of RVFV in plaque assays with NT53. NT53 was incubated with RVFV at decreasing titers, from 2.5E+6 to 2.5E+1 pfu/ml, and plaque assays performed (Figure 2A) . Captured virus was detected down to 2.5E+1 pfu/ml for RVFV. These results show that NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing whole virus even at low viral titers.\n",
            " We next determined the percentage of RVFV captured by NT53 in comparison to the total input amount. RVFV at 1.0E+6 and 1.0E+3 pfu/ml were added to NT53. At 1.0E+6 pfu/ml, 99.35% of the virus was bound to the NanoTrap particles whereas at 1.0E+03 pfu/ml, ,100% of the virus appeared bound to the NanoTrap particles ( Figure 2B ). The results confirm that the NanoTrap particles are efficient at capturing RVFV, especially at a lower titer. Interestingly, the results also suggest that a small volume of RVFV can be captured with NanoTrap particles and then recultured to grow more virus.\n",
            " RVFV detection is more sensitive with NanoTrap particle incubation\n",
            " In clinical instances of infection, the viral titers in circulation during very early stages after exposure are expected to be low and therefore, hard to detect [17] . We wanted to determine if viral enrichment by the NanoTrap particles (NT53) would enhance detection of RVFV when compared to detection in the absence of enrichment afforded by the NanoTrap. We specifically wanted to see the enrichment potential at lower viral titers when detection would be most difficult. For these assays, we chose to utilize qRT-PCR based detection due to its increased sensitivity over plaque assays. To this end, we spiked RVFV into cell culture media that contained 10% FBS at various concentrations from 1.0E+5 to Figure 2 . Characterization of RVFV NanoTrap particle capture. A) Viral supernatants were serially diluted (2.5E+6 to 2.5E+1 pfu/ml) and incubated with NT53 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The pellets were washed 4 times with water and then particles were tested in plaque assays to determine if full virus was bound by the particles. B) Viral supernatants at 1.0E+6 and 1.0E+3 pfu/ml were incubated with NT53 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sample was spun at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes and the unbound viral supernatant was saved separately. NT53 was washed 4 times with water and then particles were tested in plaque assays to determine how much virus were bound verses unbound by the particles. The percentage of bound virus at 1.0E+6 and 1.0E+3 pfu/ml was graphed. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g002\n",
            " 1.0E+1 pfu/ml. NT53 was then added to 1 ml of the spiked media. Viral capture with and without NanoTrap particles gave similar yields at higher viral titers ( Figure 3A) . However, at lower viral titers, there was a significant increase in viral capture with the use of the NanoTrap particles compared to samples without NanoTrap particle capture. There was greater than a 100-fold increase of viral detection with the use of NT53 at 1.0E+1 pfu/ml.\n",
            " We next wanted to determine if we could capture and enrich virus from a clinically relevant matrix. RVFV was spiked into 100% bovine, donkey, and sheep sera at 1.0E+05 pfu/ml. Incubation of RVFV spiked sera with NT53 resulted in enrichment by 13-, 3-, and 52-fold for bovine, sheep, and donkey sera, respectively ( Figure 3B ). These results demonstrate that NT53 not only captures but also enriches virus found in complicated matrices such as animal sera. The complex analytes (e.g. albumin) found in the sera are likely excluded by the NanoTrap particles and do not interfere with whole virus capture. However, we speculate that since the serum from each of the three animals contains different analytes, there may be interfering proteins that would lead to the observed enrichment differences.\n",
            " NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing inactivated RVFV Viral inactivation is crucial for its transport from the field or a BSL-3 facility to a BSL-2 environment for downstream analysis. However, after inactivation the virus may be susceptible to degradation. Therefore, we wanted to determine if RVFV would remain bound to the NanoTrap particles in an inactivation scenario. After NanoTrap particle incubation with RVFV and subsequent washes, NP-40 detergent was used to inactivate the virus (Figure 4 ). Plaque assays were performed to confirm viral inactivation. Plaque assays demonstrated that 0.1% NP-40 did not fully inactivate the virus incubated with or without NT53 ( Figure 4A ). Higher concentrations of NP-40 (0.5% and 1%) fully inactivated RVFV in the presence or absence of NT53. While the plaque assays confirmed inactivity of RVFV, qRT-PCR data demonstrated that RVFV was still captured following NP-40 addition ( Figures 4B). In the presence of NP-40 the levels of capture with NT53 were decreased as compared to the controls. This is likely due to the interference of the NanoTrap particle binding to RVFV due to the presence of detergent.\n",
            " We next tested the ability of NT53 to function in another commonly employed viral inactivation procedure. The samples were heat inactivated at 57uC for three different time pointsthirty minutes, one hour, and two hours -and plaque assays were performed to confirm viral inactivation. At thirty minutes approximately 1.0E+4 and 1.0E+2 pfu/ml of RVFV with and without NT53, respectively, were still detectable. Interestingly, RVFV was more resistant to heat inactivation in the presence of NT53, suggesting the NanoTrap particles may have a slight protective effect on the virus. However, complete inactivation was achieved at one hour ( Figure 4C ). While the plaque assays confirmed inactivation of RVFV, qRT-PCR data demonstrated the ability of NT53 to detect RVFV nucleic acids after heat inactivation ( Figure 4D ). These data demonstrate that it is possible to fully inactivate the virus before applying downstream assays such as qRT-PCR. Furthermore, these two experiments demonstrate the ability to inactivate a sample and transport it as a noninfectious sample, while still retaining capture.\n",
            " NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing and protecting viral RNA As we observed viral capture in the presence of NP-40, we hypothesized that the virus was being lysed and the released viral RNA recaptured with the NanoTrap particles. If the NanoTrap particles were not providing protection of the viral RNA, there will be no possibility for any downstream assays using inactivated material, which is a critical step in diagnostics. To test this hypothesis, we first lysed the virus with 1% NP-40 and followed by adding NT53 to the lysed material. Results in Figure 5A indicate that NT53 was able to capture the lysed virus. However, there was a 100-fold decrease in lysed virus with the addition of NT53 compared to the control (no NT53) with and without NP-40.\n",
            " These results mirrored what was observed in Figure 4B , where NT53 was capable of capturing virus to a lesser extent in the presence of NP-40. These results demonstrated that RVFV could be initially inactivated by traditional inactivation methods and then captured with NanoTrap particles. By incubating with the NanoTrap particles, the viral RNA will be protected and hence, can be used for downstream RNA detection.\n",
            " In order to directly show that NT53 was able to capture and protect viral RNA, we performed a NanoTrap experiment with purified viral RNA. We first incubated NanoTrap particles with purified RNA, and performed qRT-PCR assays. Results in Figure 3 . RVFV enrichment with NT53 incubation. A) RVFV was spiked into cell culture media (DMEM+++) at various concentrations from 1.0E+5 to 1.0E+1 pfu/ml. NT53 was added to 1 ml of media and captured according to standardize protocols. The pellet was washed 4 times with water, followed by processing with Ambion's MagMax 96well Viral RNA extraction kit. RVFV-spiked media without NT53 were processed in parallel. Viral RNA was quantitated by qRT-PCR with viral specific primers. B) RVFV was spiked into 100% bovine, sheep, and donkey serum at 1.0E+5 pfu/ml. NT53 were added to 1 ml of serum and captured according to a standardize protocol. The pellet was washed 4 times, followed by processing with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit. Serum without NT53 was processed in parallel. Viral RNA was quantitated by qRT-PCR. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g003 Figure 5B demonstrate that NT53 is capable of capturing purified viral RNA, albeit with less affinity than whole virus capture. NT53 was able to capture 0.01% of the input viral RNA. While we screened the NanoTrap particles for whole virus capture, we did not screen the NanoTrap particles for RVFV viral RNA capture. There is likely a NanoTrap particle that captures viral RNA with greater efficiency than NT53.\n",
            " As previous studies have shown that proteins captured by NanoTrap particles were protected from trypsin degradation, we next aimed to determine if NanoTrap particle capture could protect viral RNA from RNase degradation [9, 10] . Samples with and without NT53 were treated with RNase A at 140 or 1400 Units/ml and incubated for one hour at 37uC. Interestingly, the RNA incubated with NT53 was protected from RNase A degradation, whereas the RNA controls were subject to complete RNase A degradation ( Figure 5B ). At 140 Units/ml of RNase A, the captured RNA was detected at the same level as the RNaseuntreated sample. Even at a substantially higher RNase concentration (1400 Units/ml), 1% of the viral RNA input was still detected. Our results demonstrate that the NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing and protecting viral RNA from enzymatic degradation.\n",
            " In some situations, it may be important to retain the infectivity of the captured virus to enable the virus to be propagated for further characterization. Therefore, we evaluated the ability of the NanoTrap particles to capture and preserve the infectivity of RVFV following capture. RVFV was spiked into bovine serum and incubated with or without NT53 at 25uC for 48 or 72 h. In the absence of NT53, the infectivity of RVFV was decreased by ,3 logs ( Figure 5C ). In contrast, samples incubated with NT53 displayed only ,1.5 log decrease by 48 h. Although ,3.5 log decrease was observed with NT53 at 72 h, this still resulted in increased virus detected as compared to the control samples due to the enrichment afforded by NT53. The infectivity of RVFV was also assessed for samples that were incubated at 37uC, which would likely result in a more rapid decline in viral infectivity and thus 24, 48, and 72 h time points were examined. As suspected, a ,4 log decrease was observed in samples incubated at 37uC for 24 h without NT53. In contrast, samples captured by NT53 only displayed ,2 log decrease as compared to the control NT53 sample. At extended time points a further decrease in infectivity was observed with and without NT53, but in all cases a higher amount of infectious virus could be rescued from samples . Viral inactivation following NT53 capture. Panels A and B: NT53 was incubated with viral supernatants containing RVFV at 2.7E+8 pfu/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then incubated at room temperature with 0.1, 0.5 or 1% NP-40 for 1 hour (NP-40). Control samples were not treated with NP-40 nor captured with NT53. Samples treated with NP-40 without NT53 were processed in parallel (black bars). Viral inactivation was assayed by plaque assays (A) and viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR (B). Panels C and D: NT53 was incubated with viral supernatants containing RVFV at 2.7E+8 pfu/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then incubated at 57uC for 30 minutes, one hour, or two hours. Control samples were not heat treated nor captured with NT53. Samples heat-treated without NT53 were processed in parallel (black bars). Viral inactivation was assayed by plaque assays (C) and viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR (D Comparison of capture efficacy of NanoTrap particles and commercially available beads for RVFV capture NanoTrap particles have unique properties not demonstrated in other beads that are used for protein purification and albumin exclusion such as dye baits that make them an ideal candidate in virus capture. Therefore, we wanted to directly compare the ability of other beads to capture RVFV with NT53's RVFV capture capability. The capture of RVFV was tested with NT53 and six commercially available beads used in various assays. DEAE-Sephadex beads are used in ion exchange chromatography for purifying and isolating proteins; Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin are used for isolating nucleic acids and antibodies; Sephacryl S-200 beads are used to purify protein and macromolecules; Biorex 70 Resin beads are used for purification and fractionation of peptides, proteins, and other cationic molecules; SP Sephadex C-25 beads are used in chromatography to separate and purify protein, polypeptides, and other charged molecules; and Bio-gel HTP Hydroxyapatite beads are used in chromatography to separate and purify proteins, nucleic acids, viruses, and other macromolecules. These calcium phosphate beads work by the cationic interaction of the Ca 2+ functional groups with the carboxylate residues located on the protein surface and the anionic interaction of the PO 4 22 functional groups with the basic protein residues. RVFV was incubated with each of these beads and plaque assays were performed to determine whole virus capture. Bio-gel HTP Hydroxyapatite (HTP) captured RVFV the most efficiently, averaging 1.0E+7 pfu/ml, while NT53 performed the second best averaging 2.5E+6 pfu/ml ( Figure 6A ). The other four beads captured RVFV around or below 1.0E+5 pfu/ml.\n",
            " As we have demonstrated that NT53 not only captures intact RVFV, but can also capture and protect viral RNA from RNase A degradation, we tested the ability of HTP to act in a similar capacity. NT53 was able to fully protect the viral RNA against RNase A degradation and genomic copies for NT53 with and without NT53 treatment were similar. However, HTP beads were Figure 5 . NT53 protects viral RNA from degradation and preserves viral infectivity. A) RVFV was lysed with 1% NP-40 for 30 minutes at room temperature and then incubated with NT53 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR. Samples without NT53 and samples without NP-40 were processed in parallel. B) NT53 was incubated with purified RNA at 2.0E+8 genomic copies for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following water washes, the samples were resuspended in water and treated with 140 or 1400 Units/ml of RNase A. Samples with no RNase A treatment were processed in parallel. The viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR. Samples without NT53 were processed in parallel (black bars). C) RVFV (1.4+E7 pfu/ml) was spiked into 1 ml of bovine serum, NT53 added, and samples incubated at 25uC (for 48 or 72 hr) or 37uC (for 24, 48, or 72 h). Samples without NT53 were processed in parallel. Samples were assayed for viral infectivity by plaque assay. Control samples are samples that were processed immediately for plaque assays with no incubation period. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g005 unable to provide protection against RNase degradation, and no viral RNA was detected ( Figure 6B) . A control experiment with RNA alone demonstrated that our RNase treatment was effective. We next compared the ability of NT53 and HTP to capture RVFV during an inactivation scenario. For these experiments NT53 or HTP were added to the samples followed by viral inactivation through treatment with 1% NP-40 or heating at 57uC. The amount of virus captured was quantitated by qRT-PCR ( Figure 6C ). As was observed in previous experiments, viral inactivation with either NP-40 or heat treatment resulted in some loss of RVFV binding to the NanoTrap (1.2 and 0.8 log, respectively). However, HTP RVFV capture was more dramatically affected, resulting in a 2.5 log decrease with the NP-40 treated samples and a 2.7 log decrease in the heat inactivated samples. Collectively, our experiments demonstrate that while HTP is capable of capturing whole virus, it cannot protect viral RNA against RNase degradation and it displays a reduced ability to capture RVFV during an inactivation scenario. In contrast, NT53 is capable of capturing and protecting RVFV as well as capturing RVFV in samples that have been inactivated by heat or detergent treatment.\n",
            " We next asked the question if NanoTrap particles were capable of capturing other viruses. For this, we selected VEEV and HIV-1. VEEV, which at approximately 70 nm in diameter is a smaller virus than RVFV, which is approximately 100 nm in diameter. VEEV viral supernatants were incubated with various NanoTrap particles shown in Table 1 and capture was measured by qRT-PCR. Our data indicated that all six NanoTrap particles successfully captured VEEV, averaging 9.9E+06 genomic copies per reaction ( Figure 7A) , with a slight preference observed with NT45, NT46, and NT55 capturing 1.3E+07, 1.1E+07, and 1.1E+07 genomic copies per reaction, respectively. NanoTrap particles capture was also tested using HIV-1. HIV-1 supernatants from infected J1.1 cells were incubated with NanoTrap particles. RNA extraction was performed, cDNA was synthesized, and RT-PCR was performed. A semi-quantitative analysis shown in Figure 7B , demonstrated that all seven NanoTrap particles were able to capture HIV-1 with NT46 and NT53 demonstrating the best capture ( Figure 7B ). These results indicate that NanoTrap particles are capable of capturing multiple viruses. (7) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sample was washed 4 times with water and then particles were tested in plaque assays to determine how much virus was bound by the particles. B) NT53 or HTP was incubated with purified RNA at 1.0E+7 genomic copies for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following water washes, the samples were resuspended in water and treated with 380 Units/ml of RNase A. Samples with no RNase A treatment were processed in parallel. The viral RNA was extracted from isolated particles and quantitated by qRT-PCR (black bars). Samples without NT53 were processed in parallel (gray bars). C) NT53 and HTP beads were incubated with viral supernatants containing RVFV at 1.7E+8 pfu/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then inactivated by incubation at 57uC for one hour or incubating in the presence of 1% NP-40 at room temperature for 1 hour. A ''no bead'' control processed in parallel was included for each condition. Viral RNA was extracted from the particles and quantitated by qRT-PCR. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g006 Viral infections in nature do not occur in isolation and are often accompanied by other co-infections (bacterial and/or viral); therefore we sought to determine if the NanoTrap particles could capture RVFV in a ''mixed'' infection setting. To this end, bovine serum was spiked with RVFV only or with both RVFV and HIV, followed by NT53 viral capture and quantification as measured by qRT-PCR. Results indicated that NT53 was capable of capturing and enriching RVFV from samples that contained only RVFV or both RVFV and HIV ( Figure 7C ). Seven-fold enrichment was observed in samples containing RVFV only and 5-fold enrichment from samples containing both RVFV and HIV. These data provide evidence that the NanoTrap particles could be used with clinical samples.\n",
            " Therefore, in conclusion, the results demonstrate that Nano-Trap particles can capture and enrich RVFV from both cell culture media and clinically relevant matrices. The captured virus can then be inactivated and viral RNA protected from enzymatic degradation. The bound RVFV can be eluted off the NanoTrap particles, and used in downstream assays such as plaque assays and qRT-PCR. Furthermore, NanoTrap capture can be extended to other viruses as well, including VEEV and HIV.\n",
            " Rift Valley Fever Virus is a zoonotic virus that primarily affects livestock but has the potential to cause severe disease in humans.\n",
            " RVFV has led to outbreaks in Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula with the potential to spread to the United States and Europe. Changes in climate, travel, and trade have made RVFV an emerging disease that can have deadly economic and social consequences. Furthermore, RVFV is of biodefense interest due to its potential spread via aerosolization. There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines, so there is a reliance on sensitive and specific diagnostics early on in infection.\n",
            " The current state of RVFV diagnostics includes virus isolation, nucleic acid techniques, and antibody detection. Current RT-PCR-based assays require a critical amount of the virus circulating in the system. This can lead to misdiagnosis, especially falsenegative results, of the disease early on in infection. In contrast, our results demonstrate the ability of NanoTrap particles to enrich for RVFV from both cell culture supernatants as well as more complex matrices such as animal serum. The capability of NanoTrap particles to enrich virus is crucial early on in infection during which the virus can go undetected using other diagnostic methods. In our serum sample studies we noted different levels of enrichment depending on the source of the serum. For example, NanoTrap particles incubated in donkey serum resulted in a 52fold increase in RVFV detection sensitivity, whereas incubation in sheep serum only displayed a 3-fold increase. The presence of other analytes found in serum may be competing for capture with NanoTrap particles, which likely will differ between species as well Figure 7 . Capture of other viruses with NanoTrap particles. A) Six different types of NanoTrap particles were incubated with viral supernatants containing VEEV for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed 4 times with water. Viral RNA was extracted and quantitated by qRT-PCR assays. B) Seven different types of NanoTrap particles were incubated with 1 ml J1.1 supernatant for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed 4 times with water. The pellets were diluted in 100 ul water and RNA extracted. A cDNA synthesis using 150 ng of each sample was performed and followed by PCR using 10 ul cDNA. A DNA gel was run to determine viral capture. A sample with no reverse transcriptase added and a sample with just water were used as negative controls. The volume of each band was quantified and graphed. C) Bovine serum was spiked with RVFV (1.0E+6 pfu/ml) only or both RVFV (1.0E+6 pfu/ml) and HIV (100 ml of J.1. supernatants). Samples were incubated with NT53 for 30 minutes, viral RNA extracted and quantitated by qRT-PCR. Samples without NT53 were processed in parallel (black bars). doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g007 as between individual animals. Importantly we have also demonstrated the ability to capture RVFV in samples that also contained HIV. This is an important area of investigation, as clinical samples will likely contain multiple pathogens, providing further competition for NanoTrap binding. We hope to extend our spiked serum sample studies to experiments with serum samples taken from animals exposed to RVFV and human clinical samples. These studies will allow further optimization of the NanoTrap particle collection. In our current study we used very stringent wash conditions to ensure that the virus captured was tightly bound to the NanoTrap particles. In clinical samples, it may be necessary to decrease the number of wash steps to ensure that the maximum amount of virus is being captured from more complex samples. Alternatively, different wash buffers (altering salt and detergent concentrations) could be utilized to allow more selective binding of analytes. Due to the complex nature of clinical samples, it may also be necessary to increase the amount of NanoTrap particles added to prevent saturation. Nonetheless, our studies provide an important first step in the application of NanoTrap particles as a sample preparation and enrichment process to improve diagnostics from serum samples.\n",
            " One important advantage of utilizing NanoTrap particles is their ability to protect analytes from degradation. Previous studies have indicated that protein captured by NanoTrap particles are protected from trypsin degradation [9, 10] . In these experiments PDGF was incubated with an excess of trypsin. Following incubation the majority of the trypsin was found outside of the NanoTrap particles. However, even though some of the trypsin entered the particles, PDGF was completely protected from degradation. In the current study we extend these findings to demonstrate that viral RNA was protected from degradation in the presence of RNase A. Sample preservation is critical for stabilization of sample integrity both during field collection and during transported to diagnostic facilities. Bio-gel HTP Hydroxyapitite, while able to capture RVFV was unable to protect viral RNA from degradation, further demonstrating the advantage of using NanoTrap particles over other commercially available chromatography beads.\n",
            " Another critical aspect of the NanoTrap particles is the ability to collect viral samples and inactivate them to render them noninfectious, while still retaining the ability to detect the analyte of interest. This was demonstrated by captured of RVFV by NT53 followed by inactivation of RVFV with NP-40 (determined by plaque assays). Following inactivation, viral genetic material was still detected with qRT PCR and to a higher level than that observed with HTP beads. This is of particular importance in the transport of RVFV from a BSL-3 environment or field sample collection setting to a BSL-2 laboratory for diagnostic testing. Given that BSL-3 laboratories are both difficult to access and work in a BSL-3 environment is time-consuming and expensive, the inactivation method will allow for fewer lapses in time between obtaining the samples and the determining the results. In addition, as the NanoTrap particles allow the capture of the whole virus, the samples can then be analyzed with a variety of downstream analysis methods such as ELISA for the nucleoprotein of RVFV, western blotting, plaque assays, and qRT-PCR.\n",
            " The exact mechanism of NanoTrap binding to RVFV is unclear at this point. We hypothesize the NanoTrap particle capture is occurring through interactions with RVFV's glycoproteins, Gn and Gc. Gn and Gc are the only viral proteins available for capture by virtue of being exposed on the outside of the virion. The fact that the binding observed with HTP beads slightly exceeded NT53 in binding RVFV may provide insight into the mechanism of binding. HTP is known to bind primarily through electrostatic interactions and similarly, Cibacron blue, the affinity bait component of NT53 binds through electrostatic, hydrophobic or a combination of surface and electrostatic interactions. Based on these results, we expect that electrostatic interactions may provide the dominant mode of NT53 binding to RVFV. Due to the size of the virus (90-100 nm) as compared to the size of the NanoTrap particles (800 nm), it is unclear if the viruses are entering inside the core of the NanoTrap particle or binding to the outside of the NanoTrap particles. We have observed preferentially binding of RVFV with NanoTrap particles containing Cibracon blue baits, suggesting that the bait plays at least a partial role in the binding. Even if RVFV binding is partially or primarily found on the surface of the NanoTrap particles, the particles provide a unique advantage over other commercially available beads, which is sequestration of analytes within the NanoTrap particles. This is important as many enzymes (proteases, RNase,etc.) found in serum can rapidly digest protein and RNA. However, the NanoTrap particles can bind to small molecular weight proteins (such as trypsin) rendering them inactive [9] , thereby providing protection for other proteins and/or viruses captured by the NanoTrap particles.\n",
            " NanoTrap particles can be engineered with increased pore sizes to facilitate capture of RVFV inside the NanoTrap particles. This approach has the added advantage of ensuring capture within the particles themselves, which would be predicted to further increase the stability of the virus as well as increase the viral binding capacity of the NanoTrap particles. One potential disadvantage of larger pores sizes would be the loss of some of the sieve sieving capabilities of the particles. The size sieving is important for more complex samples (whole blood, sera, etc.), which would benefit from the ability of the NanoTrap particles to enrich for certain analytes (i.e. viruses) while excluding high abundant proteins such as BSA, which may interfere with downstream assays or mask lower abundant molecules such as low levels of viruses. However, it may be possible to obtain a balance of larger pores with efficient size sieving if the appropriate level of cross-linking could be achieved. This is an active area of research and warrants further investigation.\n",
            " Our results demonstrated that NanoTrap particle capture was not limited to RVFV, but could be extended to other viruses including VEEV and HIV. All three of these viruses are enveloped RNA viruses. Future studies will focus on the capture and enrichment of different viral classes, including DNA viruses and non-enveloped viruses. That capture of a wide range of viruses is especially important when multiple viruses cause the same type of disease and/or the symptoms of infection are very general. For example, respiratory infections can be attributed to multiple pathogens, including Influenza A and B viruses, Coronaviruses, and Adenoviruses. For this type of application, the promiscuity of the NanoTrap particles is particularly important, as it will allow the capture and enrichment of multiple viruses from the same sample. Therefore, we believe that increasing sensitivity for respiratory viral infections is an important diagnostic issue that the NanoTrap particles could address.\n",
            " In conclusion, our results have demonstrated that NanoTrap particles are able to capture and enrich whole virus. While other commercially available beads can also capture virus, only Nano-Trap particles are capable of protecting the integrity of the virus after inactivation with detergent or exposure to RNase A. However, further research is needed to determine the exact mechanism by which the NanoTrap particles capture and protect the virus. Figure S1 Elution with NaCl as demonstrated by plaque assays. RVFV supernatants were incubated with NT53 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sample was spun at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. NT53 was washed 4 times with water and then particles were eluted with DMEM+2M NaCl and incubated on ice for 30 minutes with vortexing every 10 minutes. The particles were tested in plaque assays to determine how much virus was eluted off of the particles. (TIF)\n",

            "Body Text: Non-enveloped viruses, such as coxsackieviruses, rotavirus, or poliovirus, can survive for extended periods on surfaces (9, 10) , while enveloped viruses, including H1N1 and human coronaviruses, remain infectious on surfaces after several days (6) . The persistence of dried viruses is affected by various environmental conditions and factors such as heat, moisture, pH, and the type of surface (12, 15) . Furthermore, the compositions of media may also influence the persistence of viruses. The impact of drying on viral persistence has been evaluated in previous studies using viruses typically prepared in standardized media, including a cell culture medium supplemented or not with fetal calf serum (FCS) (4, 19) . However, these media are not representative of clinical situations because viruses have been detected in protein-rich media, such as serum, and protein-poor media, including water (11, 17) .\n",
            " In the present study, the persistence of two enveloped viruses, influenza virus type A (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and two non-enveloped viruses, minute mouse virus (MVM) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), was investigated. These viruses are relevant models for assessing viral persistence. MVM is a member of the Parvoviridae family, which is known to be resistant to desiccation (9) , and the other viruses have been implicated in nosocomial infections (5) . Furthermore, infectious titers higher than 10 6 TCID 50 mL −1 can be obtained for each virus in vitro.\n",
            " In addition, components of virus-containing media may affect viral persistence. Therefore, the influence of concentrations of common media components (fetal bovine serum [FCS] , bovine serum albumin [BSA] and sodium chloride [NaCl]) on the persistence of CVB4 was also investigated.\n",
            " CVB4 E2 is a strain provided by Ji-Won Yoon (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) (8, 13) . HSV-1 (ATCC VR-260), CVB4, MVM (ATCC VR-1346), and H1N1 A/PR/8/34 (ATCC VR-1469) were propagated on Vero (ATCC CCL-81) cells, Hep-2 (ATCC CCL-23) cells, A9 (EACC N° 85011426) cells, and MDCK (NBL2) (ATCC CCL-34) cells, respectively. Infected A9 cells cultured in supplemented DMEM and supplemented MEM (Invitrogen, France) were used to culture Vero and Hep-2 cells. MEM and DMEM media were supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% L-glutamine at 37°C and incubated in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Infected MDCK cells were cultured in MEM at 35°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. When cell lysis reached at least 75%, the inoculated flasks were scratched, freeze-thawed three times, and centrifuged at 2,000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was aseptically aliquoted and stored in a −80°C freezer. The viral titer was determined by limiting a dilution assay to 50% of the tissue culture infection dose by the method of Spearman-Kärber method and expressed as log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (7) .\n",
            " CVB4E2-positive strand RNA was quantitated by two-step quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (15) . Briefly, total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, California). Total RNA was retro-transcribed to cDNA using the Affinityscript QPCR cDNA synthesis kit and a specific reverse primer at 42°C for 15 min. Positive strand-specific RT was quantitated by the brilliant II QPCR kit (Agilent Technologies Stratagene) under universal cycle conditions (10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 60°C) on a Mx3000p (Stratagene). Primers were located within the enterovirus 5'-nontranslated region, which was highly conserved among enterovirus serotypes: CVB4 forward (5'-CCCTGAAT GGGGCTAATC) and CVB4 reverse (5'-ATTGTCACCATA AGCAGCCA). The sequence of the CVB4 probe was 5'-VIC-AACCGACTACTTTGGGTGTCCGTGTTT-TAMRA (Applied Biosystems). Negative controls were performed by RT-PCR without the reverse transcriptase enzyme or without DNA. Primers and probe pairs were designed with PrimerExpress software, and data were analyzed with Sequence Detector version 1.6.3 (both from Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts). Results were expressed as the cycle threshold (Ct)\n",
            " Fifty microliters (10 µL for iterative drying) of the virus inocula were applied to the middle of each petri dish lid (35-mm diameter [Falcon]), and dried under the air flow of a class II biological safety cabinet at room temperature. The air flow speed was 0.4 m s −1 and the relative humidity was measured using a relative humidity meter (Temperature and Humidity Data logger, IHM). Medium (1 mL) was added to recover dried virus inocula. The infectious titers of harvested fluids were then determined and the results expressed as described above.\n",
            " Statistical analyses of the results were performed by the Mann-Whitney U test using Graphpad Prism version 5.00 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, USA) when appropriate. Differences were considered to be significant when P <0.05.\n",
            " Fifty microliters of clarified culture supernatant fluids from cells infected with CVB4, MVM, H1N1, or HSV-1 were applied to petri dish lid surfaces and then dried under the airflow of a class II biological safety cabinet at room temperature (20 ± 2°C). The dried inocula were recovered and titrations were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section.\n",
            " Samples were considered dried when liquid was no longer observed on the lids, which occurred within 2 h. The mean values of the infectious titers of droplets containing HSV-1, H1N1, and CVB4 were reduced by 2.33 log 10 ; 1.1 log 10 ; 1.5 log 10 , respectively, 2 h after the inoculation (Fig. 1 ). Infectious viruses were not detected in dried HSV 1 and H1N1 inocula recovered 3 and 5 d after inoculation. In contrast, the viral titers in dried CVB4 inocula recovered 2 h to 5 d post inoculation were unchanged (4.39 +/− 0.38 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 , n=4). The viral titer of MVM in dried inocula recovered one week post inoculation was unchanged and similar to the titers measured in drops applied to the lids (5.87 +/− 0.20 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 n=4). No infectious particle was detected in dried CVB4 inocula 6 weeks after inoculation, whereas a significant amount of infectious particles was recovered from dried MVM inocula (0.5 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 [detection limit] vs 4.00 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 , respectively, P <0.02).\n",
            " Reductions in the infectious titers in recovered inocula when drops were dried on petri dish lids raised several issues. The efficiency of recovering viral particles in these conditions was questioned. The infectious titer of CVB4 was determined to address this issue, and RNA was also extracted to measure the amount of viral RNA by RT real-time PCR in order to estimate the level of viral particles. The amounts of viral RNA in recovered inocula dried for 2 h at room temperature and in fresh inocula were similar, as displayed by the pattern of Ct values obtained by RT real-time PCR (mean values were 24.36 vs. 23.86, respectively, P=0.56), whereas the infectious titer values were markedly different (2.17 log 10 reduction P=0.028) (Fig. 2) . Taken together, these results demonstrated that viral particles dried on petri dish lids were readily recovered.\n",
            " Thus, after drying on a plastic surface, the non-enveloped viruses, CVB4 and MVM, remained infectious for a longer period of time than the enveloped viruses, H1N1 and HSV-1.\n",
            " The patterns of resistance of MVM, CVB4, H1N1, and HSV-1 were examined. Ten microliters of each clarified supernatant fluid containing MVM, CVB4, H1N1, and HSV-1 was dried as described above. Repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension were carried out: 10 µL of sterile distilled water was added to a dried spot to start a new cycle of drying. Thereafter, dried inocula were recovered using 1 mL of culture medium and the viral titers were determined. Fifty microliters of each culture supernatant fluid containing H1N1, CVB4, HSV-1, or MVM was applied to Petri dish lids in quadruplicate. They were dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet at room temperature from 2 h to 6 weeks. Thereafter, dried inocula were recovered using 1 mL of titer media and the infectious titers were determined and expressed as log 10 . The results are the mean ± SD of four independent experiments. The dashed line represents the detection limit of the test. Each drying cycle resulted in a gradual reduction in the viral titers of H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 of approximately −0.4, −1.1, and −1.8 log 10 TCID 50 10 µL −1 per cycle, respectively (Fig. 3) . No reduction in the viral titer was detected for MVM after each cycle of drying. Furthermore, a reduction in viral titers was not observed in clarified supernatant fluids containing viruses kept at room temperature for the duration of the experiment (data not shown).\n",
            " These results showed that iterative drying resulted in reductions in the viral titers of H1N1, CVB4, and HSV-1, whereas those of MVM remained unchanged.\n",

Fifty microliters of these viral suspensions were applied to petri dish lids and dried, and viral titers in the recovered dried spots 2 h after the inoculation were determined.\n",
            " When the CVB4 suspension was spiked in medium containing a low concentration of FCS (<0.05%) or BSA (<0.01 mg mL −1 ) (Fig. 4) , the viral titers in the recovered dried spots were higher at 2.66 and 3.08 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 , respectively. In contrast, the viral titers in the suspension containing 1.25% of FCS and more than 0.39 mg mL −1 of BSA were below the detection limit of the test <0.5 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 . The viral titers in the suspension containing more than 1.25% FCS increased steadily and reached 1.17 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 at 100% FCS (P=0.019 vs the detection limit of the test).\n",

In contrast, the viral titers in media containing between 0.1 and 2 mg mL −1 NaCl decreased from 3.08 to 2.58 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (P=0.04). In media containing more than 2 mg mL −1 NaCl, the viral titers increased steadily and reached 4.16 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 at 300 mg mL −1 NaCl (P=0.028 vs. viral titers at 2 mg mL −1 NaCl).\n",
            " The efficiency of recovering CVB4 when drops were dried in protein-rich media was analyzed. Viral titers were determined and RNA was extracted to measure the amount of viral RNA by RT real-time PCR. Experiments were performed with CVB4 spiked (1% vol/vol final dilution) in FBS (100%) or water containing 50 mg mL −1 BSA. In both protein-rich media, the amounts of viral RNA in recovered inocula dried for 2 h at room temperature and in undried inocula were similar, as displayed by the pattern of Ct values obtained by RT real-time PCR, whereas the infectious titer values were markedly different (Fig. 5) . Taken together, these results demonstrated that viral particles contained in a protein-rich medium dried on petri dish lids were readily recovered.\n",
            " Several considerations in the present study are noteworthy. The persistence of H1N1, HSV-1, MVM, and CVB4 was investigated and, for the first time, the effects of NaCl, FCS and BSA concentrations on CVB4 persistence were determined. Moreover, the effects of repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension on the persistence of H1N1, HSV-1, MVM and CVB4 were investigated. We selected petri dish lids for two reasons: they are hydrophobic, which prevents spreading of the droplet, and are non-porous, thereby improving virus viability (2) . The efficiency of viral recovery from petri dish lids was confirmed in experiments combining the measurement of infectious titers and estimation of the levels of viral particles through the amount of viral RNA measured by RT real-time PCR.\n",
            " Inactivation under the biosafety cabinet was achieved at different times based on the type of virus being tested. Inactivation curves for H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 encompassed two phases. The first phase lasted 2 h and corres-ponded to rapid decreases in the viral titer of −2.33, −1.1, and −1.5 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 for HSV-1, H1N1, and CVB4, respectively, but not MVM. In the second phase, the viral titers of each virus slowly decreased. Scheuplein and al. reported that the first phase was characterized by water loss due to the evaporation of free water from the surface (14) , which exposes viruses to a liquid-air interface, leading to virus inactivation (18) . Repeated drying followed by resuspension in water was carried out for the first time in the present study. Infectious titers of H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 decreased gradually at each cycle, whereas no significant change was observed in the MVM infectious titer. Within these cycles, each resuspension modified particle positions and allowed for the new exposure of viral particles to the liquid-air interface, which may explain the continuous reductions observed in viral titers with each cycle (14) . CVB4, which persisted for 5 weeks under the biosafety cabinet, was fully inactivated by 4 cycles of iterative drying, while H1N1 persisted for 5 d and remained infectious after 8 cycles. This difference can be explained by rehydration during the resuspension process, which markedly inactivated non-lipid viruses, as reported previously for poliovirus (3) . However, MVM, a non-enveloped virus, was not affected by iterative drying.\n",
            " Enveloped viruses were more sensitive than non-enveloped viruses in the second phase of viral persistence, which started when liquid was no longer observed on the lids; H1N1 and HSV-1 were inactivated in 5 d and 3 d, whereas CVB4 was inactivated in 6 weeks and MVM continued to be infectious. Drying was slower in this phase, which can be explained by the slow process of water loss due to the diffusion and elimination of bound water, as demonstrated previously (14) . It remains to be determined whether the process is still slower in the case of MVM, as reflected by the persistence of this virus in our experiments.\n",
            " A discrepancy was noted between our results and previous findings and was explained by several differences regarding media, surfaces, virus strains and temperature. Bean et al. inactivated H1N1 at a higher temperature (28.3°C vs. 20°C) (2) and Abad et al. inactivated poliovirus, an enterovirus resuspended in PBS, on a latex surface in less than 20 d (1) whereas CVB4 was inactivated in 6 weeks in our experiments.\n",
            " The results of our study show that the initial concentrations of BSA, FCS, and NaCl played a role in the pattern of viabil- , and 50 µL of these suspensions were applied to petri dish lids in quadruplicate. Inocula on lids were dried for 2 h at room temperature, and, thereafter, recovered with 1 mL of culture media. The infectious titers were determined and expressed as log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (■). RNA was extracted and the levels of viral RNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and expressed as C t (□). The results are the mean + SD of four independent experiments. The dashed line represents the detection limit.\n",
            " ity of CVB4 exposed to drying. The infectious titers of CVB4 after drying were higher when the virus was in pure water than in water containing BSA or FCS. These results demonstrated that the resistance of CVB4 to drying was hampered in the presence of BSA or FCS. The survival curves of CVB4 resuspended in 0 to 0.29 mg mL −1 BSA in 0 and 1.25% FCS were similar, which is consistent with the corresponding concentration of BSA in FCS under these conditions (0 and 0.30 mg mL −1 ). Taken together, these results suggest that the lower resistance of CVB4 in the presence of 0 to 1.25% FCS in our experiments depended on albumin. In contrast, with an initial concentration of more than 1.25% FCS, the impact of drying on CVB4 viability was reduced. A previous study reported that higher concentrations of proteins protected viruses against drying (16) ; however, CVB4 exposed to drying was fully inactivated in the presence of high concentrations of BSA (more than 0.39 mg mL −1 ) in the present study. The mechanism underlying the protective effect provided by high concentrations of FCS against drying remains to be determined. At an initial concentration of more than 10 mg L −1 , NaCl protected CVB4 from desiccation. This can be explained by a slow rehydration process during sample recovery, which protected the viral capsid, as previously suggested (3). In contrast, the viability of CVB4 was the lowest at a concentration of 9 mg mL −1 NaCl, which is the average concentration in blood.\n",
            " We herein showed that viruses persisted for days or even weeks on dry hydrophobic surfaces. The pattern of resistance of viruses toward drying, as illustrated in the model of CVB4, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral populations, as suggested by the results of iterative drying. Moreover, media compositions and component concentrations clearly played a role when virus suspensions were exposed to drying. The results of our study suggest that a subsequent increase in solute concentrations in droplets modulated the viability of viruses toward drying. Since the compositions of media play a role in the viability of viruses exposed to drying, the persistence of viruses in natural media (clinical or environmental), instead of defined media, need to be investigated. Further studies will be directed towards this line of investigation in our laboratory.\n",

            " The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 1 to 14 days, with a mean of 5 to 6 days. The first studies indicated that the viral load persisted up to 8 days after the onset of symptoms in mild cases and peaked in day 11 in more severe cases 4, 5 . However, upon the resolution of clinical symptoms the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory samples remains unclear, making the establishment of patient discharge and the ending isolation criteria difficult 2,4,6 .\n",

COVID-19 outbreak had a major impact on the management of clinical virology laboratories and caused a reduced availability of laboratory consumables and reagents limiting the testing capacity. The need to repeat tests to detect viral RNA poses an additional challenge. Therefore, to achieve a rational use of human and laboratory resources it is important to establish the adequate time to determine viral clearance.\n",

Therefore, we analyzed the production of specific IgM and IgG antibodies. \n",

            " The results evidenced that most patients from either group tested positive for more than two weeks. In fact, 69.8% of the patients that tested negative twice needed more than 20 days to achieve the first negative test. Moreover, 34% of patients that kept RT-PCR tests positive at the end of our study, tested positive for 40 days. These results may indicate that in a situation of lack of testing resources, patients might be re-tested only after the 20th day from the first positive test and beyond.\n",
            " Surprisingly, mild illness patients discharged home took longer to become negative than inpatients. Our results are in accordance with the results from Lan et al. 10 but in disagreement with several studies pointing that delayed viral clearance is associated with severe illness 1, 5, 11 .\n",
            " In previous studies the correlation between virus persistence and severe disease was based on the detection of viral RNA in non-survivors until death 8, [11] [12] [13] . It is important to emphasize that RT-PCR does not evaluate the infectious capacity of the detected RNA. In fact, no live virus was isolated from sample cultures obtained 8 days after the onset of symptoms 5, 14 . Therefore, the persistence of viral RNA may not be associated with disease severity but may indicate that the immune response is unable to promote the virus RNA clearance.\n",
            " To evaluate the host immune response, we determined SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG in the same day of viral RNA detection. In accordance with previous studies, patients maintain RT-PCR tests positive even after seroconversion 5, 14 .\n",

            " probably associated with the disease severity. In accordance with other studies, moderate/severe illness patients appear to have higher antibody titers than those with milder disease. Although increased titers of specific antibody may induce the expression of pro-inflammatory factors they also contribute to the inactivation and clearance of virus 12,15-17 . Our study evidenced that patients discharged home were younger, had mild disease, presented low IgG titer and maintained viral RNA for a longer period of time. On the other hand, patients in the inpatient group were older, moderately to severely ill, presented a higher titer of IgG and had a better capability to achieve viral RNA clearance.\n",
            " Since mild illness is associated with a low viral load 4, 18, 19 , we hypothesize that the exposition of patients discharged home to SARS-CoV-2 did not elicit an effective immune response, explaining the milder disease and the need of more time to viral RNA clearance.\n",
            " The lack of information regarding persistence of virus RNA and infectivity, disease severity and immune response, supports the current guidance of viral clearance confirmation prior to patient transference out of dedicated COVID-19 wards and of ending isolation in mild illness patients.\n",
            " In conclusion, our study highlights that viral RNA may persist for a long period of time in respiratory samples; mild illness patients present a weak immune response; viral RNA may remain even after the rise of IgG titer; and persistence of viral RNA is not necessarily associated with severe disease but may result from a weaker immune response instead. Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation, (minimum -maximum). There was a significant difference between the mean number of days to achieve the first negative test in the inpatients and in the patients discharged home, P=0.027. The inpatients were older than the patients discharged home, P<0.001. \n",

            "Body Text: The oCVD reactor is an enclosed sealed chamber that maintains conditions to allow for vapor phase polymerization of PEDOT, monomers are stored in a glass holding chamber that is then heated via a thermal heating jacket to the vaporization temperature of the monomer. The monomer is then introduced via a valve system that controls the rate of vapor introduction into the chamber. The oxidizing agent is stored in a crucible in the main chamber that is heated to the agent's sublimation temperature during the deposition process. Substrates are held in an upsidedown holder that contains a heater and a rotational motor. Chamber vacuum pressure is monitored using low and high vacuum gauges. Synthesis of PEDOT thin films was done through the reaction of commercially available liquid EDOT and powdered iron (III) chloride (FeCl3). Deposition pressures of 2×10 -3 Torr were achieved through the use of a combined roughing and turbo pumping system. EDOT monomer was introduced into the chamber using a needle valve after being heated to 130 °C to vaporize. FeCl3 oxidizing agent was introduced after the powder was sublimated from a crucible via slow controlled heating to 180 °C at a ramping rate of approximately 10 °C per minute. Once both the vaporized monomer and oxidizing agent were introduced into the chamber the heated substrates were uncovered through the use of a shutter system and were kept at a rotation speed of 5 rpm throughout deposition to result in uniform and homogeneous PEDOT films. The deposition temperature effect on the conductivity of oCVD PEDOT was investigated by growing the polymer film on a glass substrate. The use of glass substrates instead of the fabrics is to objectively measure the conductivity of oCVD PEDOT films on typical substrates (i.e., flat non-conductive substrates) and also to exclude the thermal degradation of the fabrics during the oCVD process. The relation between temperature (T) and conductivity (σ) was plotted as a log(σ)\n",
            " vs. log(T) as shown in Fig. S2 . The log(σ) linearly increased with increasing the temperature.\n",
            " Above the certain critical point (100 °C), the slope became slightly gentle but still steadily increased with the temperature. Fig. S3 , the peak at around 1520 cm -1 , representing C=C stretching mode, tends to intensify with increasing substrate temperature. It is well known that the areal intensity of the C=C stretch peak is regarded as a valuable indicator to compare conjugation lengths as well as doping levels of PEDOT; the stronger peak is attributed to the longer conjugation length (30) (31) (32) . Therefore, our FTIR results prove that a high-temperature surrounding facilitates the chain growth during the oCVD vapor-phase polymerization. Notably, the peak was intensified by raising the substrate temperature from 323 K to 343 K, whereas a lack of change was observed at higher temperatures. Thus, we can conclude that the conjugation and doping level of oCVD PEDOT is a strong function of the deposition temperature, and reaches a maximum level of conjugation and doping at a certain temperature, which is ~343 K. The temperature-dependent 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600\n",
            " Normalized Intensity (a.u.)\n",
            " doping level is supported by our previous reports (30, 32) that experimentally verified the high carrier concentrations in oCVD PEDOT through Hall effect measurements, of which the carrier density increases with increasing substrate temperature and the density reaches the theoretical maximum carrier density (~2×10 21 cm -3 ) at a substrate temperature of 70 °C or higher. Therefore, the conductivity trend conversion in Fig. S2 is likely attributed to the dependency of the doping level on the substrate temperature. The crystallinity of polymer films is another significant factor dominating the charge transport property of PEDOT. We previously reported that resulting oCVD PEDOT films are in the nanocrystalline state (30) . Herein, to investigate the crystalline grain size depending on the deposition temperature, the surface topological information of the PEDOT was analyzed using atomic force microscope (AFM), as shown in Fig. S4 . The film roughness was gradually increased from 1.44 to 4.69 nm by raising the deposition temperature from 50 to 130 °C, implying that the size of the grain-like structures of the film could be enlarged under a high-temperature condition.\n",
            " The larger grain size obtained at higher substrate temperatures may enhance the charge carrier transport, which contributes to the increase in conductivity of oCVD PEDOT with substrate temperature. In addition to the enhanced conjugation and doping level in oCVD PEDOT with increasing substrate temperature (Fig. S3) , the correlation between the grain size and the substrate temperate supports the conductivity results where higher substrate temperatures result in higher conductivity of oCVD PEDOT (30, 31) . To identify the origin of the sharp current drops in more detail, the sensor was tested with and without covering a polyester (PE) fabric on the PEDOT face, and the results were added to and non-pressured state, decreased more than five times using the PE cap.\n",
            " It is well known that glass is positively charged when contacted with other materials due to a typical triboelectric effect (33) . The initial glass/PEDOT contact accompanies positive and negative charge generation on the glass and PEDOT, respectively. The generated transitory charge creates a triboelectric voltage across the PEDOT/glass interface, resulting in a signal interference representing the current drop. In general, the triboelectric phenomenon takes place in a short moment (< 10 ms) and rapidly reaches an equilibrium state. Therefore, as shown in Fig. S8 , the sensing response (current variation, recorded at the equilibrium state) was not significantly disturbed by the triboelectric effect. In the same manner, when we employ the sensor to monitor a blood pressure pattern from the wrist or neck, the triboelectric effect only occurs at the initial moment of touching the sensor on the body and disappears within several milliseconds; thus, a current change caused by blood pressure could be solely extracted. To analyze the sustainability of our PEDOT fabric sensor against standard use as well as abrasion, the current change was measured against cycles of general use and intentional rubbing.\n",
            " In Fig. S9A , the change in current from initial measurements (∆I/I0) was measured across 200 cycles of standard use, where the sensor was pressed against the skin, then the current was measured after removal to see if the repeated contact had any degrading effect on the resistance of the PEDOT film deposited on the fabrics. In Fig. S9B , the ∆I/I0 was again measured across 200 cycles of abrasion against human skin. In this experiment, the sensor was rubbed against human skin unidirectional for approximately 25mm. After removal from skin, current was measured with a voltage of 0.1V across each sensor, then reported at five cycle increments. Fig. S9A and B\n",
            " demonstrate that oCVD PEDOT deposited on fabric have good sustainability against both standard use and abrasion, where the ability to transfer current through the film was maintained and no signs of degradation due to repeated use or abrasion occurred. The outermost non-woven facet among the three layers in a disposable mask was mainly covered by the oCVD PEDOT, while a discontinuous (hence highly resistive) PEDOT film was formulated on the middle fabric (Fig. S10A ). In addition, the deposition of PEDOT was not observed in the innermost fabric due to the masking effect of the upper layers. Therefore, it is expected that the majority of current flows in the outer fabric. As such, we only utilized that outermost layer for investigating the working mechanism. Herein, we develop a mathematical protocol to correct a baseline shift and estimate an accurate respiratory rate in real-time. As shown in the raw data (Fig. S11A) , the currents representing inhalation and exhalation states were fluctuated due to inconsistent tidal volume for each breath, and noise from the minute movement of the subject. To correct the undesired shifts, the results were differentiated with the time domain (Fig. S11B ). This process serves as a role to correct the baseline to be zero so that a current deviation caused by breath is selectively extracted. The next step is the Fourier transformation to convert the time-scale data to a frequency domain.\n",
            " Randomly released electrical noise or other possible errors derived by a human motion could be ignored in a specific frequency range of 0-1 Hz which contains respiratory pattern information (Fig. S11C) . Therefore, as a consequence of the overall data processing series, precise respiratory rates were successfully estimated (16.2 and 40.2 min-1 for before and after running, respectively) as shown in Fig. S11C . It should be noted that the mathematical data processing renders quantitative analysis for respiratory rate even if uncontrollable variables from the environmental or human-dependent conditions affect the signal, thus ensuring reproducible data extraction. The thickness of the PEDOT film was measured through the common technique of measuring thickness of a reference sample (PEDOT on Silicon substrate) using an ellipsometer, that was deposited concomitantly. This technique is a well-documented method to examine thin film thickness information on substrates where direct measurement is difficult, but where a reference thickness sample on silicon can be measured with either an ellipsometer or profilometer (55, 56) . Therefore, the thickness of the PEDOT film on fabric in the study is mentioned as the nominal thickness, as the true thickness measurement was measured on the silicon sample. To verify this technique, we have conducted additional measurements where cross-sectional images of PEDOT films deposited on fabric were measured via SEM and compared to ellipsometer measured reference samples deposited concomitantly with the fabric samples. The silicon reference sample measured with the ellipsometer reported a thickness 237 nm. SEM crosssectional images of PEDOT films deposited on nylon fabric were obtained utilizing a Thermo Fischer Scientific Teneo. From the SEM images (Fig. S12) , thickness information was measured along with multiple film locations, where the average film thickness was approximately 230 nm, showing less than 5% error between the SEM cross-sectional image and ellipsometer measurements of the silicon reference sample deposited concomitantly. This shows the validity of the reference sample technique in measuring sample thicknesses where direct thickness measuring is difficult.\n",

Remarkably, the UVB (290-320 nm) proportion of total solar UV-flux received by skin can 60 be well below 2% depending on the solar angle, which determines the atmospheric light path length 61 and thereby the degree of ozone-filtering and preferential Rayleigh scattering of short wavelength 62 UV light [9] . 63 Z253081).

To this end, we 297 infected Calu-3 target cells with sUV or mock-treated virus as outlined before, followed by 298 comparative gene expression profiling at the end of the experiment.

            " CoV-2-induced expression changes (antagonized by viral pre-exposure to sUV) as shown in the 300 Volcano plot depiction [displaying statistical significance (P value) versus magnitude of change 301 (fold change)] (Fig. 5) . SARS-CoV-2 infection caused a pronounced upregulation of stress 302 response gene expression including genes encoding key regulators of inflammatory signaling 303 including IL1A, IL1B, IL6 , TNF, CCL3, CXCL10, CSF2, and NFKBIA, oxidative stress defense 304 such as SOD2, and heat shock response such as HSPA6 (Fig. 5) . In contrast, after infection with 305 sUV-exposed virus, most of these infection-associated expression changes were either attenuated 306 or completely obliterated, an observation consistent with pronounced suppression of SARS-CoV-307 2 infectivity as a consequence of sUV-exposure. Remarkably, these expression changes closely 308 mirrored those observed in response to HCoV-NL63 infection that occurred with or without viral 309 exposure to sUV (Fig. 3) . 310 311 >Figure 5< 312 313 Likewise, we observed a striking similarity between the gene expression changes elicited by 314\n",

Remarkably, dose levels used throughout this pilot study are representative of terrestrial ground 340 level exposure suggesting environmental relevance, and significant coronavirus inactivation was 341 detectable even at low exposure levels expected to be beneath the cutaneous sunburn-inducing 342 threshold (Figs. 1, 2, 4) [2,6,8 ]. In this context, it is remarkable that recent research has already 343 indicated that ground level solar UV displays significant virucidal effects targeting coronaviruses 344 including SARS-CoV-2 [2,6,11,13]. However, the complexity of human exposure levels to solar 345 UV as a function of solar zenith angle, seasonality, spectral distribution, and latitude remain to be 346 addressed before any firm conclusions relevant to human populations can be drawn. Specifically, 347 the anti-viral activity of specific spectral components of sUV remains to be determined since the 348 light source employed in our prototype studies emitted full spectrum simulated solar UV, and the 349 action spectrum of virus inactivation by solar UV remains largely undefined. For example, it is 350 possible that the UVA portion of ground level sUV significantly contributes to the coronavirus- \n",

            "Body Text: In late 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a new acute infection of the respiratory tract [1] . COVID-19 propagation has grown exponentially worldwide and the WHO declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 [2] . Fast, accurate testing is necessary in the fight to slow down and reduce the high spread and impact of the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Better control of COVID-19 seems to be dependent on the identification of infected individuals as fast as possible, enabling their isolation and follow-up (and quarantine) of the people with whom they were in contact [3] .\n",
            " To date, different methods for COVID-19 detection are available, often clustered depending on the detected material: nucleic acid, antigen (viral protein), or host antibodies [4] . The most rapid tests are based on the detection of protein antigens or host antibodies, which are highly suitable for point-of-care diagnostics. However, the main problem with these tests is their low sensitivity and, in the case of antibody tests, the fact that they detect advanced or late stages of the disease; so these tests are not useful for early detection [4] . Hence the cornerstone for early diagnosis of COVID-19 involves the detection of viral RNA with sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) [4] . The most widely used NAAT for SARS-CoV-2 amplification is RT-qPCR. However, its implementation requires qualified personnel and technically complex laboratory instruments (such as PCR-related thermocyclers), it takes time (hours or days) and it would be difficult to use in a point-of-care setting [5, 6] . For these reasons, the development of new and rapid testing strategies is of the utmost importance to counteract this pandemic.\n",
            " Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an isothermal NAAT that can detect the presence of viral RNA in biological samples by amplification of selected regions of its genetic material. The reaction has high specificity and sensitivity, associated with exponential amplification of a set of six different target sequences simultaneously [7] . Furthermore, LAMP is an attractive option to be used as a point-of-care test for SAR-CoV-2 detection [5] , as it can be performed in an easily handled, portable thermocycler which is easily manageable by non-expert users. Several studies have demonstrated its usefulness in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Using fluorescent labeling in the RNA amplification, LAMP may enable the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at a very low concentration (from one SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy) [16] and in a short time [6, 9, 13, 17] . Moreover, this methodology is compatible with simple visual colorimetric detection procedures and with relatively unpurified samples [9, 16, 18, 19] . Published data show that the usual time required for SARS-CoV-2 detection is around 20-30 min, which needs to be added to the viral RNA extraction time [9, 16, 18] . Only sparse studies have achieved a reduction of the required time, although results can be obtained in around 10 min by using colorimetric LAMP [19] or combining different sets of primers [9] .\n",
            " Here, we tested the use of a newly designed set of six primers of the ORF1ab sequence, as well as their combination with a previously published set of primers of the N sequence, to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA with an optimized colorimetric LAMP protocol. Data show that the protocol is able to detect a useful range of viral RNA copy numbers (250-10,000) in a short time (16-22 min, depending on the required sensitivity), making it easily applicable in a point-of-care setting for different samples, including saliva.\n",
            " For all determinations Twist Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control 2 (MN908947.3) was used (Twist Bioscience, CA, USA).\n",
            " One saliva sample was collected, after at least 1 h without drink and food, in nuclease-free water (VWR, Llinars del Vallès, Spain) and proteinase K (Roche, Barcelona, Spain) solution. The sample was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then for 5 min at 95 • C in order to inactivate the proteinase K.\n",
            " LAMP primers were designed and prioritized on the ORF1ab sequence, using LAMP Primer Explorer v5, following the manual indications [20] . N primer set, from the nucleocapsid protein sequence, was obtained from the work of Zhang et al. [9] . Primer sets include an outer forward primer (F3), outer backward primer (B3), forward inner primer (FIP), backward inner primer (BIP), loop forward primer (LF) and loop backward primer (LB). LAMP primers for N and Orf1ab coding regions, described in Table 1 , were purchased from Sigma Genosys (Haverhill, UK).\n",
            " LAMP reactions were performed using WarmStart R Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs Ltd, Hitchin, UK). \n",
            " In order to determine the sensitivity of the two sets of primers, alone or in combination, with an improved LAMP protocol, different LAMP reactions were performed using the Twist SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control. In a first step, different enhancer compounds of the LAMP reaction were tested (Gly, GHC, BSA, MgCl 2 and dNTPs). In a second step, GHC was used as an enhancer compound (having revealed the best improvement), and the sensitivities of N primers, ORF1ab primers and the combination of both primer sets were tested. The sensitivity was calculated considering all detected positive wells versus all true positives plus the false negative wells, multiplied by 100. Finally, in order to test the feasibility of applying the LAMP procedure to saliva samples, LAMP reactions using 1 × 10 4 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA control were executed, adding 5.5 μl of pretreated saliva sample.\n",
            " All LAMP reactions were prepared in an enclosed room using designated pipettes and filter tips in order to prevent contamination. LAMP reactions were executed in a total volume of 25 μl. Each reaction was performed with 12.5 μl of WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix. This Master Mix is an optimized formulation of Bst 2.0 WarmStart DNA Polymerase and WarmStart RTx, in a solution containing a visible pH indicator (phenol red) for rapid and easy LAMP detection [21] . The reaction also contained 1 μl primer mix (1.5 μl was also tested), which was made with: 40μM of FIP and BIP primers, 5 μM of F3 and B3 primers and 10 μM of LB and LF primers; different amounts of fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; 5 μl of GHC (final concentration 40 mM); and the final volume was made up to 25 μl with nuclease-free water. Other enhancer compounds were also tested, but not included in the final protocol. Reactions were set up on ice, then incubated at a constant temperature of 65 • C (63 • C was also tested) for up to 30 min (14-30 min were visually tested) in an Applied Biosystems 2720 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Madrid, Spain). To end the reaction, a rapid cooling step was performed by immersing the tubes in iced water. When storing in a freezer, the colors remain stable. At the final reaction time point, the absorbance at 440 (yellow) and 560 (red) nm was determined.\n",
            " Rapid diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infection is the most effective method to reduce the spread of COVID-19 [3] . Particularly, NAAT tests have a relevant interest due to their sensitivity, and because they are able to detect the infection at the first stages of its evolution [4] . The LAMP technique is a prominent solution to combine NAAT with fast test detection [5] . In the present study, we evaluated the performance and usefulness of a set of primers for the ORF1ab sequence, as well as their combination with a previously published set of primers of the N sequence [9] to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our data showed that the ORF1ab primers provided rapid, visual virus detection in only 16 min. In addition, a simultaneous reaction with both ORF1ab and N primer sets increased detection sensitivity, particularly when a low number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences were present. Moreover, the results showed that application of the LAMP technique with these two sets of primers under the conditions tested is able to detect synthetic viral RNA spiked in saliva samples.\n",
            " Firstly, in order to optimize the LAMP protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection (using 5 × 10 3 copies of RNA), compounds commonly used to enhance sensitivity of the LAMP technique were tested with the ORF1ab primer set: 0.87 μM Gly [22] , 40mM GHC [9] , 0.24μM BSA [22] and the addition of different concentrations of MgCl 2 (0.2 and 1 mM) and dNTPs (0.5, 1 and 1.5 mM) [23] . A consistent effect of GHC improving \n",
            " ORF1ab the reaction speed was observed (Supplementary Figure 1) . A minor impact of Gly, MgCl 2 and dNTPs concentration was also observed. BSA alone or in combination with GHC did not produce a significant improvement in detection time (Supplementary Figure 1 ). In addition, the LAMP reaction temperature (65 and 63 • C) and concentration of primer sets (1 and 1.5 μl of primer mix) were tested, and the results indicated that the LAMP reaction at 65 • C and with 1 μl of the primer mix constituted the best option (Supplementary Figure 2) . Thus 40mM GHC, 1 μl of the primer mix and a LAMP reaction at a constant temperature of 65 • C was used subsequently. The next step was assessing the performance of the primer sets at different viral loads. The results showed that the ORF1ab primer set enabled the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in just 16 min, irrespective of the presence of the N set. Detection sensitivity at 16 min was 100% for 1 × 10 4 RNA copies of SARS-CoV-2, and 86% for 5 × 10 3 RNA copies using the ORF1ab or the mix of ORF1ab and N primer sets ( Figure 1A) . However, sensitivity diminished at lower RNA concentrations, with ORF1ab primers allowing for detection of only 29 or 14% of replicates (seven replicates) containing 1000 and 500 RNA copies, respectively ( Figure 1A) . A LAMP reaction of 22 min resulted in increased sensitivity using any set of primers, but particularly with the mix and at very low RNA copy number ( Figure 1B) . In fact, 100% of replicates were detected either using individual sets of primers or their combination (seven replicates) when 5 × 10 3 RNA copies of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 or higher were present ( Figure 1B) . Interestingly, the combination of both primer sets in the same well managed to detect 250 RNA copies of SARS-CoV-2, although with a sensitivity of 43% ( Figure 1B) . It is noteworthy that virus-free samples (nontemplate control [NTC] wells) remained unchanged in color (red) throughout the 22 min of LAMP reaction ( Figure 1C ). This is of particular interest because a longer LAMP reaction (30 min) turned orange in some wells incubated with ORF1ab primers (either alone or in combination with N primers), which could mask visual detection at this time point ( Figure 2D ). Thus the final recommended incubation time was up to 22 min, because at 30 min the test could give false positives.\n",
            " To circumvent incorrect readings at 30 min, visual detection could be complemented with absorbance determination by spectroscopy. This would also address the issue of personal variation in the ability to distinguish colors between borderline positive samples, and could be easily implemented in a point-of-care device with a filter or a more complex readout. The ratio at 440/560 nm reflects the relation between the yellow (positive) and orange-pink (negative). Then the sample value could be corrected by the NTC absorbance ratio. In this sense, we have considered as positive the samples that gave a ratio higher than the NTC (≥1. 5 primer sets, and ≥1.3 for the N primer set). In this case, the limits of detection and sensitivity for ORF1ab and the mix of both primer sets at 30 min, determined by their absorbance ratios, were similar to the results visually detected at 22 min (Figure 2A-C) . Therefore this work shows that SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is feasible with the application of a LAMP assay and that this method allows for visual identification of positive samples. We propose to perform the assay using the combination of the two sets of primers tested, enabling the determination of a sample, in duplicate in the same test tube, by visual identification. Using the present protocol, the ORF1ab primers would provide rapid detection (in 16 min) followed by the reaction of the N primers (up to 22 min). Additionally, the use of both primer sets together and in the same test tube is able to provide increased sensitivity, particularly at very low RNA concentrations.\n",
            " Although the WHO has recommended nasopharyngeal specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection, their obtainment requires trained healthcare workers and the procedure is relatively invasive for subjects [24] . Saliva samples could represent very suitable biological material for COVID-19 diagnosis [25] . Thus we preliminarily tested the feasibility of applying the LAMP procedure, to obtain this first information with these sets of primers, to saliva samples spiked with SARS-Cov-2 RNA. In principle, saliva samples could contain some inhibitors that could make it difficult to detect the virus and this would require RNA isolation before any NAAT. Here we assessed whether the saliva components of a healthy volunteer influenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by LAMP. Our results showed that although visual detection of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (1 × 10 4 copies) was delayed in the tubes containing saliva, RNA could be detected, albeit at a longer time than in non-saliva test tubes, regardless of the primer set used. As previously shown, 100% of replicates for ORF1ab acquired the yellow/orange color after 16 min of LAMP reaction, whereas in the replicates with saliva, the change of color appeared after 22 min (Figure 3 ). In the same way, for the N primer set, 100% of replicates were visually positive at 22 min of LAMP reaction, but only 80% of replicates with saliva were positive after 30 min ( Figure 3) . Therefore, the results show that SARS-CoV-2 detection is possible from a saliva specimen without performing RNA isolation and increasing the reaction time of the current protocol. The increased time required to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be associated with the presence of proteins, particularly RNases, present in saliva samples [26] and remaining after the treatment with proteinase K or the thermal protocol required for proteinase K inactivation, which could cause RNA degradation [27] .\n",
            " At the final point of the LAMP reaction, the ratio of absorbance at 440/560 nm of positive wells was lower in the replicates with saliva than in the replicates without saliva (for ORF1ab primer set, 1.50 ± 0.02 vs 1.74 ± 0.02 and for N primer set, 1.34 ± 0.04 vs 1.59 ± 0.06; saliva and non-saliva samples, respectively). Moreover, saliva did not alter the NTC wells, which showed an absorbance ratio \n",
            " Our results demonstrate that the LAMP technique applied to the tested set of ORF1ab primers is able to detect a relatively low number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA within only 16 min of reaction and allows for visual diagnosis of the presence of COVID-19 active infection. Beyond that, the combination of this primer set with a predefined primer set of the SARS-CoV-2 N region [9] in the same reaction tube does not produce interference and increases detection sensitivity, particularly with a lower number of viral RNA copies. Moreover, it is of interest that the combination of both primer sets would reduce the cost and handling of testing samples in duplicate and represent a double check for detection of the disease; even if one of these primer sets does not generate color, the other can generate color and reveal a positive sample. Therefore the use of primer sets designed from two different viral target regions (ORF1ab and N) seems to be a good strategy to generate a new and highly sensitive rapid detection test by the user-friendly LAMP technique. In addition, preliminary results suggest the utility of these primer sets directly with saliva samples, which can contribute to reducing the time taken for diagnosis as well as the use of material, technical equipment and human health resources in the fight against COVID-19. The procedure reported would be easily scalable in a point-of-care setting and could be implemented in the generation of a new and sensitive rapid point-of care device for SARS-CoV-2 RNA visual detection.\n",

            "Title: The ubiquitin-proteasome system in spongiform degenerative disorders\n",
            "Body Text: Spongiform, or vacuolar, change describes tissue that contains numerous vacuoles that are round or oval in appearance at the light microscopic level and up to 50 μm in diameter [1] [2] [3] . These vacuoles can be either extracellular or intracellular, often displacing large organelles such as the nucleus and mitochondria. By electron microscopy (EM), vacuoles can contain curled fragments of membranes and sometimes a fluffy or granular electron-dense material ( Fig. 1B) [1, 4, 5] . Intramyelinic vacuoles within white matter correspond with splitting of the myelin layers [6] [7] [8] . In addition to vacuolar change, neural tissue may also exhibit microvacuolation, in which the neuropil is disrupted by numerous small vacuoles of 2 to 10 μm in diameter [2, 3] , or status spongiosus, where irregular cavities appear surrounded by a meshwork of glia [2, 3] . Spongiform encephalopathy describes a group of diseases that exhibit vacuolar change accompanied by neural and/or glial cell death in the central nervous system. The vacuoles observed in spongiform degeneration are the result of a specific disease process and not merely the product of cell loss.\n",
            " Spongiform pathology is most commonly associated with prion diseases (Fig. 1A ) [1] , but also occurs in the brains of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases (Fig. 1A) [3, 4, 9, 10] , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , and metabolic disease [17] . The extent and localization of spongiform change varies depending on the specific disease, yet each disorder shares common pathological features (Table 1 ). In animals, spongiform degeneration has been observed in prion disease [1] , retrovirus infection (Fig. 1B ) [18] [19] [20] , and as a consequence of mutation in several different genes (Fig. 1B) [6, 7, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . The vacuolar change observed in animals shares pathological features with human spongiform encephalopathies, and the degree and localization of spongiform change varies by infectious agent or gene mutated (Table 2 ). Histological comparisons of disease versus control tissue from both human and animal spongiform encephalopathies reveals increases in ubiquitinated proteins near areas of spongiform change [4, 9, 20, 26, 27] , indicating that aberrant ubiquitination may be involved in the pathogenesis of spongiform degeneration.\n",
            " Ubiquitination of proteins serves as a signal for a variety of cellular functions (reviewed in [28] ). Ubiquitination of a substrate protein occurs via a cascade of three enzymes (an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ubiquitinprotein ligase) and is reversible by the action of a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). Additional rounds of ubiquitination can result in the formation of a polyubiquitin chain through one of the seven internal lysine residues of ubiquitin. The number and location of attachment sites of mono-or polyubiquitin on a substrate protein comprises the ubiquitin signal [28, 29] . A major proteolytic system in the cell is the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which degrades a majority of cytoplasmic proteins. Substrate proteins processed by the UPS are typically tagged with a polyubiquitin chain linked through Lys 48; four ubiquitins linked via K48 is the minimal signal recognized by the proteasome for substrate degradation [30] . In addition to substrate proteins, the UPS also regulates levels of the ubiquitinating enzymes. A number of E3 ligases are degraded via the UPS [31] [32] [33] , thus modulating levels of ubiquitination in the cell. Since the ubiquitinating machinery is regulated by the proteasome, proteasomal impairment can result in aberrant ubiquitination of proteins in addition to accumulation of ubiquitinated proteasome substrates [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Proteasome-independent ubiquitin signals, such as monoubiquitination and K29-and K63-linked polyubiquitination, regulate endocytic trafficking, lysosomal protein degradation, DNA repair, protein aggregation and autophagic degradation, and protein localization [29, 35, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] .\n",
            " Because of its versatility as a signal, changes in the ubiquitination of proteins can affect a wide range of cellular processes. This suggests that the pathogenesis of spongiform degeneration may result from dysfunction of common pathways regulated by ubiquitination in spongiform disorders with different etiologies. This review will examine the evidence implicating several cellular pathways in spongiform degeneration and explore how these processes are connected and maintained via ubiquitination of proteins. Recent studies indicate that aberrant ubiquitination mediates the pathogenesis of spongiform change and cell death by altering normal cell function and intracellular signaling.\n",
            " The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) refer to a number of fatal diseases that occur in man and animals that result in widespread vacuolation, neurodegeneration, and gliosis of the central nervous system (reviewed in [1, 47] ). TSEs are characterized by progressive motor difficulties, such as unsteady gait, ataxia, and tremor, accompanied by cognitive and sensory defects [1, 47, 48] . Human TSEs include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease (GSS), kuru, and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) [1, 47, 48] . Animal TSEs include scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), chronic wasting disease, feline spongiform encephalopathy, and transmissible mink encephalopathy [1, 47] . Spongiform areas in TSE tissues are typified by degenerating neurons that appear swollen and are associated with intracellular and extracellular membrane-bounded vacuoles containing accumulations of curled membrane fragments or other granular material [1, 5] . The TSEs are known as prion diseases since prion protein (PrP) appears to be the transmissible agent in these encephalopathies, because accumulation of a disease-related conformer of PrP in the brain tissue of affected organisms occurs along with spongiform pathology [26, 49, 50] . Prion plaques, reminiscent of amyloid plaques observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), are sometimes seen in the cerebellum (Fig. 1A) and other brain areas, consisting of fibrils that radiate out from a central core, giving a stellate appearance [3, 26] . In advanced stages of these disorders, secondary spongiform change of the white matter may be seen [1] . Experimental models of prion diseases are Left to right, CJD prion plaque surrounded by vacuoles 1 , counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin; CJD cerebral cortex 2 , counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin; kuru cerebral cortex 2 , counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin; and AD medial temporal lobe 3 , counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin.

The extent of the pathology observed varies according to the strain of prion and species infected, but generally is more severe with a shorter latency than that of naturally occurring TSEs [1, 5, 47] .\n",
            " The conformational change of normal cellular PrP protein (PrP C , cellular) into a disease-related structure (PrP Sc , scrapie) is thought to initiate all TSEs. Familial forms of TSEs (GSS, FFI, and familial CJD) result from mutations in the PrP gene, PRNP, which presumably alter the tertiary structure of PrP [47, 48, 51] . In kuru, non-familial CJD, and all animal prion diseases, infection with or consumption of tissues containing PrP Sc mediates the propagation of PrP Sc from PrP C . PrP C is necessary for disease pathogenesis, since animals or cells that lack PrP C are resistant to PrP Sc infection and fail to propagate prion infectivity [52] [53] [54] [55] . This supports the hypothesis that PrP Sc acts as a template for the misfolding of PrP C in the host's tissues (reviewed in [48, 56] ). This hypothesis is further supported by the observations that latency to symptom onset is dependent upon PRNP gene dosage [52, 57] and that PRNP null mice carrying a hamster PRNP transgene are more sensitive to infection with hamster prions than with mouse prions [57, 58] .\n",
            " Immunocytochemical staining of brain tissue from CJD or experimental murine scrapie reveals punctate ubiquitin labeling in and around areas of spongiform change as well as at the periphery of the prion plaques [26, 27] . Ubiquitination of proteins in brain homogenates from scrapie-infected animals increases with disease duration as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while proteolytic activity of the proteasome decreases with infection [59] . These observations are supported by cDNA microarray analysis of mice infected with a strain of BSE [60] , which reveals differential expression of UPS machinery genes in response to infection, including several proteasome subunits, E2s, and E3s. PrP C has been shown to be ubiquitinated and processed by the UPS [39] , while PrP Sc appears to be ubiquitinated at late stages of disease when the protein is highly aggregated [59, 61] . These reports indicate that dysfunction of the proteasome and the subsequent changes in protein ubiquitination resulting from proteasome impairment play a key role in prion disease pathogenesis. In addition to the UPS, other cellular pathways likely contribute to the vacuolation and degeneration of nervous tissue observed in TSEs. Increases in oxidative stress have been reported (reviewed in [62] ) and there is considerable evidence for aberration in the proteolytic processing and trafficking of PrP C [49, [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] and lysosomal dysfunction in TSEs [27, 49, 60, 68, 69] . These processes are regulated by both proteasome-dependent and -independent ubiquitin signaling (reviewed in [29, 70, 71] ).\n",
            " Progressive neurodegenerative diseases that are not characterized as TSEs, such as AD and diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), also exhibit spongiform change in defined brain regions [3, 4, 9, 10] . The vacuolar change in AD and DLBD resembles TSE, although instead of widespread spongiform degeneration, vacuolation and cell loss is restricted to the medial temporal lobe and the amygdala [3, 4, 9] . The etiology of spongiform change is not related to PrP Sc , since inoculation of laboratory animals with affected brain tissue does not result in transmission of the spongiform pathology, as it would with TSE brain tissue [4, 49] . AD and DLBD brain tissue do not exhibit prion plaques or the increased PrP immunoreactivity characteristic of TSEs [4, 10, 26] . Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that PrP C may modulate the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) [72] , a protein central to the etiology of AD, since differential processing of APP contributes to the production of amyloid deposits that accumulate in AD brains [73] .\n",
            " Similar to TSEs, ubiquitin immunoreactivity is increased in areas near spongiform degeneration in AD and DLBD brains [9, 26] , and the presence of ubiquitin-positive proteinaceous inclusions is positively correlated with spongiform change [3, 9] . These proteinaceous inclusions are characteristic hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease and are immunoreactive for UPS machinery in addition to ubiquitinated proteins (reviewed in [74] ). Measurement of proteasome activity and ubiquitinating activity in post-mortem AD [75, 76] and Parkinson's disease [77] brain tissue reveals a significant impairment of the UPS in neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that, similar to the TSEs, cell death and spongiform change in these diseases are mediated by dysfunction of the UPS and altered cellular ubiquitin signaling. Other similarities between TSEs and neurodegenerative diseases that exhibit spongiform change include mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress (reviewed in [78, 79] ), and aberrations in the endosomal trafficking of proteins (reviewed in [80] ), suggesting the ND, not determined.\n",
            " involvement of both proteasome-dependent and proteasome-independent ubiquitination in the pathogenesis of these diseases.\n",
            " Spongiform pathology has been reported in central nervous system tissue from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) resulting from HIV infection. Approximately one-fifth of patients have white matter vacuolation of the spinal cord [12] [13] [14] , and a smaller percentage of patients have spongiform change in cortical areas [11, 13, 16] . Animal models of HIV infection have more extensive spongiform pathology. Macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus [19] and mice infected with a number of different retroviruses [8, 18, 20, 81, 82] display spongiform degeneration of either grey or white matter and exhibit motor deficits. Differences in the localization and extent of spongiform pathology depend upon the strain of virus used and the cell type(s) that each virus strain infects [82, 83] . The retroviral env protein appears to confer many of the differences between retroviral strains [84] [85] [86] [87] . Experimental manipulation of env to create chimeric env proteins from different strains of a mouse retrovirus has revealed that env plays a large role in conferring neurovirulence [84] . Differential post-translational processing of env by different cell types in mouse brain affects viral production and presence of spongiform pathology in a given brain region [86] . Furthermore, transgenic expression of a retroviral env protein by itself is sufficient to produce spongiform pathology in mice [85] , so production of viral particles per se does not lead to vacuolation and cell death.\n",
            " Similar to human neurodegenerative diseases, brain areas exhibiting spongiform change display no increase in PrP immunoreactivity [14] , but do show an increase in ubiquitin staining in areas adjacent to those displaying vacuolar change [20, 88] . Infection of mice with the ts1 strain of Moloney murine leukemia (MoMuLV) retrovirus results in spongiform degeneration with Lewy body-like cellular inclusions near areas of spongiform change [20] , suggesting that viral infection may promote protein aggregation. One pathway by which retroviruses could increase protein aggregation is by disrupting UPS function [34, 38, 89] , similar to the UPS dysfunction and ubiquitin-positive proteinaceous inclusions associated with neurodegenerative diseases or the decrease in proteasome activity and presence of ubiquitinated, aggregated PrP Sc observed in TSEs.\n",
            " The importance of the UPS in the onset of spongiform pathology in retrovirus infection models is highlighted by a recent study [90] , which examined the effect of different ubiquitin mutant transgenes in mice infected with ts1 MoMuLV. Transgenic mice that express K48R ubiquitin, which is capable of forming polyubiquitin chains of any linkage except K48, survive longer and demonstrate delayed onset of spongiform pathology compared to wild-type controls after ts1 infection. K63R ubiquitin transgenic mice, whose cells can produce polyubiquitin chains of any linkage except K63, had similar disease onset and survival as wild-type ubiquitin mice [90] . These results suggest that K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation may be involved in the neurodegenerative process and onset of spongiform pathology caused by retroviral infection in mice and humans. However, since elimination of K48-mediated ubiquitination only delayed and did not prevent spongiform pathology and cell loss, proteasome-independent ubiquitin signaling may also be utilized by the cellular processes that contribute to spongiform degeneration. These processes likely include oxidative stress pathways [91, 92] , and functions of the endosome-lysosome system [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] .\n",
            " A human metabolic disease, Canavan's spongiform leukodystrophy (CD), results in epilepsy and spongiform degeneration of white matter [17] . This disease results from mutation in the aspartoacylase (ASPA, also known as N-acetyl-L-aspartate aminohydrolase) gene, which encodes the enzyme responsible for catabolizing N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA). Patients with CD have a buildup of NAA levels in the brain, as well as increases of NAA in the blood and urine [17] . A rodent form of CD, the Tremor rat, harbors a spontaneous deletion in ASPA, resulting in no protein product and increased NAA levels in the brain [23] . Animals exhibit seizure-like activity and spongiform degeneration of both white and grey matter. Viral gene transfer of ASPA into the Tremor rat ameliorates the seizures but does not attenuate spongiform pathology [98] , suggesting that vacuolation and degeneration is not a direct result of increased NAA levels, but possibly signaling pathways initiated by an increase in NAA. Injection of NAA into rats can produce seizures [23] , and NAA treatment of rat cortical tissue increases markers for oxidative stress [99] , which indicates that neuronal excitability and oxidative stress signaling contribute to spongiform degeneration resulting from increased brain NAA levels in CD. Oxidative stress can modulate a number of cellular pathways, including gene transcription [100] [101] [102] , receptor tyrosine kinase signaling [103] , and apoptosis [79, 104] . Increased oxidative stress is known to alter levels of ubiquitination in the cell, as well as change transcription of several UPS genes [102, 105] . Evidence for increased oxidative stress in CD and the Tremor rat indicates that, in addition to oxidant signaling pathways, the pathogenesis of spongiform change may be mediated by changes in ubiquitination.\n",
            " The mahogany mouse [21, 106] and the Zitter rat [25, 107] both exhibit spongiform pathology in the brain, body tremor, and changes in hair color and texture. Both rodents harbor spontaneous mutations in the attractin (Atrn) gene [21, 106, 108, 109] , which encodes a protein known to regulate coat color in rodents by modulating the melanocortin signaling pathway [108, 110, 111] . Signaling via melanocortin receptors (Mc1r, Mc3r, and Mc4r) is activated by the ligand αmelanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and antagonized by the inverse agonists Agouti and Agouti-related protein (AgRP) [108, 110] . The melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r) is a key regulator of pigment production in hair follicle melanocytes ( Fig. 2A) , while in brain cells, body mass and energy homeostasis are regulated via Mc3r and Mc4r (Fig. 2B ) [110] .\n",
            " Atrn is a type I transmembrane protein that acts as an accessory receptor for Agouti, but not AgRP [108, 110, 111] . Atrn may exert its effects in the melanocyte by either extending Agouti inhibition of Mc1r or via an unknown intracellular signaling cascade. Mutation of Atrn increases Mc1r signaling, resulting in animals with a darker coat [108, 111] . In the neuron, Atrn may or may not act via an unknown signaling pathway to modulate Mc3r and Mc4r signaling; mutation of Atrn results in leaner mice [106, 110] , but has no significant effect on food intake [106] , indicating that Atrn may impact energy homeostasis signaling, possibly via a downstream effector of Mc3r/ Mc4r or a separate pathway. Atrn may also be involved in cell survival signaling in the neuron (Fig. 2B) , since small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Atrn exacerbates cell death in response to proteasome or mitochondrial inhibition [112] and one study [109] suggests that Atrn plays a role in antioxidant signaling via the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-mediated cell survival pathway. Zitter rats exhibit age-related neurodegeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons [113] , which are sensitive to changes in oxidative stress. These neurons display increased ubiquitin immunoreactivity and, by EM, abnormalities of mitochondria and endocytic structures [113] . Mahogany mice are also reported to have mitochondrial abnormalities, including functional deficits and increased oxidative stress [114] . These findings indicate that changes in oxidant signaling, ubiquitination, and endocytic trafficking may all contribute to the spongiform pathology seen in these mutant mice.\n",
            " The link between perturbations in ubiquitination and human spongiform disorders is especially salient given that loss of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase mahogunin ring finger-1 (Mgrn1) [22, 115] results in progressive spongiform degeneration in mice. Null mutation of Mgrn1 (Mgrn1 md-nc ) produces a very similar phenotype to Atrn mutations, including widespread spongiform degeneration, body tremor, and dark coat [22, 111, 116] . Despite the similarity between Mgrn1 md-nc and mahogany phenotypes, biochemical interaction between Mgrn1 and Atrn has not been established. Atrn protein levels are normal in Mgrn1 md-nc mice [22] , suggesting that either Atrn is not a substrate for Mgrn1-mediated ubiquitination or Mgrn1mediated ubiquitination of Atrn is a proteasome-independent signal. Ectopic expression of Atrn does not rescue the Mgrn1 null mutation, indicating that Mgrn1 function is genetically downstream of Atrn function [22] . Like Atrn, Mgrn1 is also involved in the melanocortin signaling pathway, although precisely how Mgrn1 modulates melanocortin receptor signaling is unknown [108, 110, 111] . One possibility is that Mgrn1 ubiquitinates the receptors or the downstream effectors of Mc1r/Mc3r/Mc4r (Fig. 2) . Another possibility is that Mgrn1 acts by ubiquitinating components of an unknown Atrn signaling pathway. Identification of Mgrn1 substrates will help elucidate how Mgrn1 regulates melanocortin signal transduction.\n",
            " The neurodegeneration resulting from Mgrn1 null mutation indicates that Mgrn1, like Atrn, may also participate in cell survival signaling. The widespread vacuolation of brain tissue seen in these mutant mice is very similar to the pattern observed in TSEs (Table 2) . However, unlike TSEs, the brain tissue of these mice does not exhibit increased PrP immunoreactivity or protease-resistant PrP Sc [22, 117] . While PrP is ubiquitinated [39] , Mgrn1 does not ubiquitinate PrP [22] , implying that the spongiform degeneration seen in Mgrn1 md-nc is not directly related to prion protein processing and toxicity. We recently identified the endosomal sorting protein, tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101), as a substrate of Mgrn1 E3 ligase [118] , associating dysfunction of endosomal ubiquitin signaling to the pathogenesis of spongiform change in Mgrn1 null mice. A recent report [114] describes mitochondrial dysfunction and increased levels of oxidative stress in the Mgrn1 md-nc mutant mice, suggesting that oxidative stress may also play a role in the spongiform degeneration observed in these mice.\n",
            " 3. Proteasome-dependent and -independent ubiquitin signaling regulates the cellular response to stress and activation of cell death pathways in spongiform degeneration\n",
            " The aberrant ubiquitination observed in spongiform encephalopathies is indicative of increased cellular stress and dysfunction of the UPS. Altered ubiquitin signaling can affect a number of cellular pathways, including those that control cell survival. Programmed cell death via apoptosis is regulated extensively by the UPS (reviewed in [119] ), since a number of pro-and anti-apoptotic proteins are E3 ligases and their substrates [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] . Mitochondria are also mediators of apoptotic cell death; leakage of mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm is a potent proapoptotic factor (reviewed in [127] ). In addition, mitochondria can be acted upon by signals both inside and outside the cell to promote or circumvent apoptosis [122, [128] [129] [130] .\n",
            " Activities of the mitochondria and proteasome are linked, since inhibition of the proteasome can impair mitochondrial function [131] [132] [133] [134] and mitochondrial impairment leads to decreases in proteasome activity and upregulation of ubiquitinating enzymes [131, [135] [136] [137] [138] . Recent evidence indicates that the UPS may be critical for the maintenance of mitochondrial fusion and fission machinery [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] , which is important for sustaining mitochondrial function and health. These studies indicate that cross-talk between the mitochondria and UPS regulates apoptotic signaling, so dysfunction of either the proteasome or mitochondria can initiate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and result in cell death [144] .\n",
            " One major source of cellular stress is the oxidation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids by reactive oxygen species (ROS) [145, 146] . ROS are generated by the function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), but are normally controlled by cellular antioxidant systems [147] [148] [149] [150] . Increases in cellular ROS, resulting from impairment of the ETC or loss of protein antioxidants, can easily overwhelm cellular defenses [151] [152] [153] . ROS damage to mitochondria can lead to additional ROS release and initiation of apoptosis [154] [155] [156] . ROS damage to proteins can change protein conformation, alter enzyme activity, and promote aggregation, necessitating clearance of damaged proteins by the cell's proteolytic machinery, usually the UPS (reviewed in [145, 157] ). Proteasome activity increases in cells exposed to mild oxidative stress [138] , presumably to handle increased cellular levels of proteasome substrates. However, high levels of ROS can oxidatively modify the proteasome, decreasing its activity [135] and impairing the cell's ability to remove damaged proteins, resulting in increases of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins [34, 38, 105, 158, 159] . In addition to oxidative modification of cellular components, low levels of ROS can serve as an intracellular signal for kinase activation and gene transcription (reviewed in [103, 160] ).\n",
            " Two models of oxidative stress, manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) knockout mice, display spongiform degeneration [99, 156, 6, 7] , highlighting a role for oxidant signaling and cellular stress in the pathogenesis of spongiform encephalopathies. SOD2 is a cellular antioxidant and Nrf2 is an oxidant-responsive transcription factor; knockdown of either of these proteins impairs cellular defenses against ROS. Furthermore, impairment of mitochondrial function by mutation of ETC subunits can result in increased ROS and spongiform degeneration: missense mutation of the ETC complex III subunit, cytochrome b (CYTB), produces spongiform degeneration that resembles CD in dogs, which is accompanied by impairment of ETC activity and increased ROS [24] , while mutations of the ETC complex IV subunit VIa cause decreases in mitochondrial function, resulting in neurodegeneration and vacuolation of brain tissue in fruit flies [161] . These examples indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction and increased ROS can activate pathways that result in both vacuole formation and cell death.\n",
            " Increases in markers for oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death have been reported for prion diseases [62, 162] , neurodegenerative diseases [78, 79, 151] , retroviral infection [91, 92] , a mouse model of CD [99] , Zitter rat [109, 163] , and both mahogany and Mgrn1 md-nc mutant mice [114] . The role of oxidative stress in promoting spongiform pathology is emphasized by studies that demonstrate a protective effect of antioxidants [91, 99, 163, 164] . Treatment of ts-1 MoMuLVinfected mice with antioxidants delays onset and decreases severity of spongiform pathology [91] . In addition, antioxidant treatment decreases apoptotic cell death of cells from Zitter rats [163] , SOD2 −/− mice [164] , and cells exposed to NAA [99] . Because antioxidants do not prevent spongiform pathology, oxidative stress signaling is probably only one of multiple pathways involved in the pathogenesis of spongiform disorders.\n",
            " Increased oxidative stress may contribute to spongiform pathology via several pathways (Fig. 3) . Central to these pathways is the interdependence of normal function of the proteasome and mitochondria. Regardless of the precipitating factor(s) specific to each of the spongiform degenerative disorders, once proteasome function is compromised, mitochondria can become impaired and vice versa [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] . An escalation of cellular stress could occur, since not only does a decrease in proteasome activity result in protein aggregation [34, 89, 158] , but protein aggregates have been experimentally shown to directly inhibit the proteasome [165, 166] , likely decreasing proteasome activity further. Increases in ROS can accelerate this process by promoting both aggregation and proteasomal impairment [135, 137, 157, 167] , contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and additional ROS production. This interplay between ROS levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, proteasome impairment, and protein aggregation could result in the release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria and initiation of apoptosis in neurons, possibly contributing to the cell death characteristic of spongiform degeneration. Proteasomal dysfunction can also result in aberrant ubiquitination of proteins, since many ubiquitinating enzymes are regulated by proteasomal degradation [31] [32] [33] [34] 89, 158] , which can alter signaling in many cellular pathways due to changes in the amount, activity, conformation, and/or localization of proteins regulated by ubiquitination [29, 35, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Impairment of the proteasome could also promote a shift to lysosomal/autophagic degradation of proteins in the cell (reviewed in [168, 169] ), which is discussed in the following section.\n",
            " In TSEs, increased ROS may promote the conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc . Experimental treatment of recombinant PrP C with ROS in vitro generates oxidized PrP that tends to aggregate, is protease-resistant, and is capable of templating itself, much like PrP Sc [167] . Aggregation of PrP Sc can inhibit the proteasome [166] and PrP aggregation can activate apoptotic pathways [170] . Oxidative stress signaling via the ERK pathway is influenced by both PrP C [53] and Atrn [109] . Loss of function of either protein via modification or mutation results in a decrease in activated ERK and an increase in apoptotic cell death in response to oxidative stress [53, 109] . PrP null mice have increased levels of oxidized and ubiquitinated proteins in their brains and decreased proteasome activity, supporting a role for PrP C in the cellular regulation of oxidative stress [171] and suggesting that increases in protein aggregation and decreased proteasome activity may result from loss of PrP C function in TSEs.\n",
            " Mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis likely contributes to neurodegeneration in retroviral infection, since overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in mice increases survival and decreases severity of vacuolar change after ts-1 MoMuLV infection [172] . Atrn and Mgrn1 may play a more direct role in maintenance of mitochondrial function, since both Mgrn1 md-nc and mahogany mice exhibit mitochondrial defects in addition to spongiform change [114] . Whether caused by aggregated PrP, virus, or gene mutation, impairment of the UPS and altered ubiquitination in spongiform disorders could result in mitochondrial dysfunction, release of ROS, increase of cellular stress, and activation of apoptosis (Fig. 3) . However, both antioxidants and antiapoptotic factors fail to prevent spongiform degeneration, indicating that other cellular pathways contribute to cell death and vacuole formation in spongiform pathogenesis.\n",
            " Accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins that cannot be processed by the UPS can inhibit proteasome function [165] and increase cellular stress. Increased levels of cellular stress may alter ubiquitin signaling, shuttling proteins towards proteasome-independent degradation when the UPS is overwhelmed or compromised [168, 173] . We and others have shown that aggregation of proteins into a specialized structure called the aggresome is mediated by K63linked polyubiquitination [37, 174] . Sequestration of harmful molecules into an aggresome minimizes their toxicity and allows the cell to degrade them in bulk via autophagy (reviewed in [175] ). Autophagy (\"self-eating\") is a cellular process whereby cytoplasmic contents, organelles, or cells are surrounded by membranes (forming an autophagosome) and delivered to the lysosome for degradation (reviewed in [176] ). Autophagy is activated in response to impairment of the UPS [173] , increased cellular stress [168] , and ROS signaling [177] [178] [179] . Autophagy must be tightly regulated by the cell; autophagy dysfunction [180, 181] or prolonged activation of autophagy [182] can result in autophagic cell death.\n",
            " The membrane-bound vacuoles observed in spongiform encephalopathies resemble autophagic vacuoles, leading to the hypothesis that spongiform degeneration results from autophagic cell death [5, 183] . Accumulation of autophagosomes has been reported for CJD [184] , experimental prion disease [183, 185] , neurodegenerative disorders [186, 187] , retrovirus infection [20] , and in Zitter rat [113] . This increase in autophagic vacuoles may result from the cell trying to rid itself of unwanted proteins that are accumulating due to impairment of the proteasome and protein damage due to increased ROS (Fig. 3 ) [104, 168, 182] .\n",
            " Alterations in activation of autophagy can affect mitochondrial health, as damaged mitochondria are degraded via autophagy [188] . Ubiquitination of outer mitochondrial membrane components tags mitochondria with ubiquitin and serves as an autophagic degradation signal in several cell types [189] [190] [191] , suggesting that altered ubiquitination may impair the removal of mitochondria by autophagy. Increases in cellular ROS levels by dysfunctional mitochondria can damage lysosomes, while impairment of lysosomal function can cause accumulation of damaged mitochondria from reduced mitochondrial autophagy (reviewed in [192] ). Impairment of proteasomal and lysosomal degradative pathways can lead to the activation of both apoptotic and autophagic cell death. In addition, prolonged impairment of the proteasome can result in increased amounts of lipofuscin, a nondegradable material in lysosomes, which is a marker for lysosomal dysfunction [193] . As illustrated in Fig. 3 , the cell must maintain a delicate balance between normal functions of the UPS and mitochondria to avoid a buildup of protein aggregates and ROS that can activate either autophagy or apoptosis. The mitochondrial deficits, increased oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration observed in mahogany and Mgrn1 md-nc mice [114] likely indicate an upset of this balance.\n",
            " Although apoptosis and autophagic cell death are different pathways that result in cell death, experimental evidence supports both processes contributing to cell death in response to mitochondrial inhibition and increased ROS [104] . Therefore, neurodegeneration in spongiform encephalopathies could be the result of activation of both apoptotic and autophagic cell death pathways. The intracellular and extracellular vacuoles that characterize spongiform change in grey matter may originate from incompletely degraded and/or incorrectly trafficked autophagosomes. Exocytosis of autophagosomes could contribute to extracellular vacuoles observed in spongiform tissue; autophagic cell death could also produce extracellular vacuoles, since undegraded autophagosomes could persist in the neuropil after loss of the cell that originally contained them. The neurodegeneration and vacuolation of tissue in spongiform disorders may result from activation of both apoptotic and autophagic cell death pathways by proteasome impairment and/or changes in ubiquitination that alter cellular signaling.\n",
            " Trafficking of proteins via the endosomal pathway into the lysosome comprises a major proteolytic system for membrane proteins in the cell. In addition to regulating protein levels, endocytic trafficking also modulates cell surface receptor signaling [70, 71, 194] . Modification of endocytic cargo proteins and the endocytic sorting Potential mechanisms by which impaired proteasome function and increased oxidative stress in spongiform encephalopathies could result in cell death. Impairment of the proteasome by protein aggregates, perturbations in ubiquitin signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction and/or increased cellular ROS can result in increases in proteasome substrates and protein aggregates, alterations in ubiquitination, and apoptotic and/or autophagic cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction and prolonged or aberrant activation of autophagy. Impairment of mitochondrial function by loss of Mgrn1 or attractin signaling, proteasomal dysfunction, or increased cellular ROS can activate apoptosis, increase cellular ROS levels, and inhibit the activity of the proteasome. Increased oxidative stress can promote protein aggregation, which can inhibit the proteasome and activate autophagy, impair the functions of both the mitochondria and the proteasome, and activate apoptosis. machinery by ubiquitination (typically mono-or multi-monoubiquitination) regulates intracellular trafficking [29, 43, 46, 195, 196] . Because the UPS controls the levels of the E3 ligases and DUBs that modulate endocytic trafficking [35, 118, 197] , the proteasome and lysosome degradative systems are not independent from one another. Proper regulation of endocytic sorting is also necessary for autophagic degradation [198] and cellular health; mutations in endosomal sorting proteins have been linked to autophagy dysfunction and neurodegeneration [199] .\n",
            " Sorting at the early endosome is accomplished by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs, numbered 0, I, II, and III). ESCRTs are responsible for directing lysosome-bound cargo into endosomal intralumenal vesicles (ILVs), forming a structure called the multivesicular body (MVB) (reviewed in [46] ). The MVB/late endosome can then fuse with the lysosome, delivering the ILVs for degradation. The MVB can also fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the ILVs as exosomes (reviewed in [200] ), which may function in intercellular signaling. Intracellular trafficking and lysosomal degradation is perturbed in TSEs [26, 27, 63, 68, 69, 201, 202] , AD [80] , retroviral infection [93, 94, 97] , cells lacking Mgrn1 [118] , and Zitter rat [113] .\n",
            " PrP C is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein that primarily is trafficked via the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane, although populations appear in the endocytic pathway [65, 67] and cytoplasm [39, 66] . PrP membrane association is necessary for prion disease, since mice expressing PrP C missing the GPI anchor are resistant to clinical disease after infection with scrapie, similar to PrP knockout mice, despite having high levels of PrP Sc and amyloid plaques in their brains [202] . This indicates PrP Sc toxicity is likely dependent upon its localization to the plasma membrane and/or endocytic system. The conformational change from PrP C to PrP Sc probably depends upon a number of factors, but abnormal trafficking to an acidic compartment like the lysosome or MVB may contribute to the propagation of protease-resistant PrP [64] . In fact, subcellular fractionation of scrapie-infected mouse brain [63] reveals that protease-resistant PrP (PrP Sc ) accumulates in fractions that also contain markers for the late endosome and lysosome. This is in contrast to protease-sensitive PrP (PrP C ), which is prevalent in lighter fractions representing early endosomes [63] , indicating that the conversion of PrP C into PrP Sc may alter the trafficking and localization of PrP in the cell. PrP is known to be released extracellularly via exosomes [203] , so changes in PrP trafficking could modify the amount of prion protein released by exosomes. Altered trafficking of PrP Sc compared to PrP C would also modify intracellular signaling (Fig. 4) , which could contribute to spongiform degeneration [71] .\n",
            " Retroviruses utilize the endosomal sorting machinery for viral budding (reviewed in [204, 205] ), perturbing normal endocytic sorting and trafficking [94, 206] . This hijacking of the endocytic machinery occurs because viral gag proteins can disrupt the interaction between the ESCRT-0 protein hepatocyte growth factorregulated receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) and the ESCRT-I protein, Tsg101 [87, 94] . Binding of gag to Tsg101 recruits the remaining ESCRT proteins to either the MVB or the plasma membrane for assistance in viral budding [204, 206] , disrupting sorting of normal endocytic cargo (Fig. 4) . Trafficking defects of endocytic cargo in HIVinfected cells can be rescued by overexpression of Tsg101 [94] , suggesting that these defects are dependent upon competition between Hrs and gag for a limited amount of ESCRT-I. The interaction of retroviral gag proteins with Tsg101 is dependent upon membrane association and monoubiquitination of gag [93, 207] . Alterations in trafficking by viral infection affect intracellular signaling, and increased release of exosomes alters intercellular signaling. Increases in exosome release are observed with retroviral infection, since viral particles produced at the MVB are then released via exosomes [96, 208] . Extracellular PrP release is increased in cells that are infected with both PrP Sc and MoMuLV [209] . Thus, retroviral infection alters normal intracellular trafficking and can impair lysosomal degradation of proteins (Fig. 4) .\n",
            " Our recent identification of Tsg101 as a substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mgrn1 has emphasized the role of endocytic trafficking in spongiform disorders [118] . Like other sorting proteins, Tsg101 activity is regulated by ubiquitination [196] . We identified an interaction between Mgrn1 and Tsg101 and found that Mgrn1 multimonoubiquitinates Tsg101. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Mgrn1 results in enlargement of the endocytic compartment and impairment of the lysosomal degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor [118] . This indicates that loss of Mgrn1-mediated ubiquitination of Tsg101 in Mgrn1 md-nc mice impairs sorting at the endosome, preventing endocytic cargo from being degraded by the lysosome, as well as potentiating receptor signaling (Fig. 4) . Impairment of lysosomal degradation, like proteasomal inhibition, results in accumulation of proteins destined for degradation [210] ; this accumulation increases cellular stress, activating cell death pathways [104, 173] . Impairment of sorting at the endosome also results in enlargement of endocytic structures [46, 69, 80, 118] ; enlarged endosomes could also contribute to the membranebounded vacuoles observed in spongiform diseases in grey matter. In white matter, perturbation of the endocytic trafficking of myelin proteins and lipids (reviewed in [211] ) could contribute to intramyelinic vacuoles by interfering with processes necessary for the maintenance of myelin sheaths. Evidence of endocytic trafficking dysfunction in TSEs, retroviral infection, and Mgrn1 null mice reveals that accumulation of lysosomal substrates either through impairment of ESCRT sorting or a shift towards exosome release could play a role in the pathogenesis of spongiform disorders (Fig. 4) . Diversion of lysosomal substrates from the lysosome can alter intracellular signaling, which can then activate both apoptotic and autophagic cell death pathways, likely causing accrual of autophagosomes and increased cell death, which could result in spongiform change and neurodegeneration.\n",
            " Spongiform degeneration is the hallmark of prion diseases, yet this pathology is not specific to prion protein. Spongiform disorders of different etiologies share dysfunction of common processes, indicating that multiple factors act via the same cellular pathways to produce spongiform pathology. Perturbation of ubiquitination is seen in brain areas exhibiting spongiform change, suggesting a role for proteasome dysfunction and altered ubiquitin signaling in these disorders. The discovery that loss of the E3 ligase Mgrn1 in the Mgrn1 md-nc mouse results in spongiform neurodegeneration supports the idea that ubiquitination modulates the pathways involved in the onset of spongiform change. Alterations in ubiquitin signaling modulate cellular processes by both proteasome-dependent and proteasomeindependent mechanisms. Changes in ubiquitination resulting from PrP Sc , viral infection, environmental factors, aging, or gene mutation in these encephalopathies could impair protein degradation via both the proteasome and the lysosome. Accumulation of proteasomal and lysosomal substrates could then increase levels of cellular stress, activating cell death signaling.\n",
            " Identification of the pathways involved in spongiform neurodegeneration has been aided by a number of genetic mutants that exhibit spongiform change. Mutations in ASPA, SOD2, Nrf2, and CYTB emphasize a role for mitochondrial dysfunction and increased ROS in the onset of spongiform degeneration. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidant signaling are important activators of apoptotic cell death, which could produce the neurodegeneration seen in spongiform encephalopathies. Both oxidant and ubiquitin signaling can activate autophagy, which could be a contributor to spongiform vacuole formation. Spongiform vacuoles share many characteristics with autophagosomes and accumulation of autophagic vacuoles has been reported for a number of spongiform disorders. Autophagy is dependent upon proper endocytic trafficking and lysosome function, which is perturbed in prion diseases, AD, and retroviral infection. We have shown that loss of the E3 ligase Mgrn1 directly impairs endocytic trafficking through its interaction with the sorting protein Tsg101, further emphasizing a role for trafficking in the pathogenesis of spongiform degeneration.\n",
            " Studies of PrP trafficking and function, retrovirus replication, and Mgrn1 and Atrn function has increased our understanding of the processes involved in spongiform degeneration. Further identification of interactors of PrP, Mgrn1, Atrn, and viral proteins will help elucidate signal cascades that result in cell death and vacuolation in these disorders. Examination of different spongiform encephalopathies has illuminated several key cellular pathways that are affected in the pathogenesis of vacuolar change, which include ubiquitin signaling, protein degradation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and intracellular trafficking. More understanding of specific proteins in the cellular processes that result in spongiform pathology will enable researchers to identify drug targets to slow down or halt the progression of spongiform pathology in patients with these disorders. Fig. 4 . Potential mechanisms by which dysfunction of ubiquitin-mediated endosome-to-lysosome trafficking in spongiform disorders results in abnormal intracellular signaling, attenuation of lysosomal protein degradation, and impairment of autophagy. Exogenous PrP Sc and ligand-bound receptors enter the cell via the endocytic pathway. Receptor signaling is modulated by lysosomal degradation, which is dependent upon correct ESCRT-mediated sorting of the receptors. PrP C trafficking is disrupted by PrP Sc , which can mediate the conversion of endogenous PrP C into PrP Sc in the MVB or other endocytic compartment and accumulates in the MVB/late endosome. Infection of a cell with retroviruses results in the production of viral gag proteins, which hijack the ESCRT sorting machinery to aid in viral budding at the MVB or at the plasma membrane (not shown). Viruses and PrP in the MVB can be released from the cell via the exosome pathway. Loss of Mgrn1-mediated ubiquitination and viral gag proteins disrupt normal ESCRT sorting of cell surface receptors, which interferes with receptor degradation by the lysosome, potentiating receptor intracellular signaling. Dysfunction of both the ESCRT sorting machinery and the lysosome impair degradation of cellular proteins by autophagy.\n",

To compare the groups, we performed a one-way ANOVA with a Sidak post-hoc comparison. Data that violated the homoscedastic error assumption were natural logarithm (Ln)-transformed. To offset availability bias from complete-case analysis, we used mean imputation for missing data among the 6 variables of interest.\n",

This included the prevalence of mild tachycardia, with an average heart rate of 108 beats per minute, without hypotension. The Although underlying demographic and exam characteristics were found to contribute to patient outcome following ED intubation, Because of the complex nature and continuously evolving understanding of this unprecedented disease process, long-term morbidity was thought to exceed the parameters of the study, and primary outcomes focused on mortality to assess for primary patient outcomes.

In the first few weeks, the department approach was to intubate patients early in their ED stay and avoid high flow nasal cannula and noninvasive ventilation out of fear of viral aerosolization and infecting staff. Whether this fear was justified is an area of debate. 10 Patients were also intubated early given the levels of hypoxia noted in these COVID-19 patients despite some of these patients having clinical pictures that looked better than their pulse oximetry readings. This was the approach our colleagues in other NYC EDs were taking early in the NYC surge as well.\n",
            " Several weeks into this COVID-19 surge, it became clear that patients after intubation were spending weeks on mechanical ventilation with high mortality rates. 11 In early April, our department started applying alternative treatment methods to avoid intubation, such as placing patients in a prone position to improve oxygenation and the use of high flow nasal cannula and/or noninvasive ventilations. 12, 13, 14 This helped avoid a number of intubations.

We found that within this cohort, male sex, advanced age, a history of coronary artery disease, the non-respiratory findings of lactic acidosis, elevated D-dimer, and CKD/AKI were correlated with death either in the ED or during the patient's hospital course. Fever, hypotension, and even initial respiratory status (including our analysis of the pre and post Sp0 2 [the Sp0 2 delta]) were not strongly correlated with outcomes (likely because of the fact that all patients were severely hypoxic on arrival). Increased BMI did not correlate with mortality.\n",

            " We thought, based on changes in patient selection for intubation, that there would be a change in mortality for patients that were intubated over the study time period. One hypothesis was that the mortality might go up because patients who were more likely to survive would not be intubated at all. Unfortunately, the number of cases is too small to show a definite trend. Data on patients treated with non-invasive ventilatory strategies was out of the scope of this study.\n",

            "Body Text: The vicious Covid-19 virus has its spectre all over the world for over a year now. There is a wave of research about various aspects of this infections which include dynamics of disease spread, (SIR models), the effect of social distancing on infections, the economic effects of Covid lock down amongst others. 1 However, scarce efforts are devoted to understand the regional disparity in infections and what particularly drives the cluster of infections in a country. In this paper, we explore this issue using India as a testbed.\n",
            " India is chosen as our case study particularly because of its wide regional diversity in several dimensions. In terms of land area, it is the 7th largest country in the world and it is the home to almost 1.38 billion people (second largest population after China). India is geographically and culturally diverse. Currently with 28 states and 8 centrally administered Union Territories, India speaks at least 21 officially recognised languages and practices 8 major religions having numerous sects within each.\n",
            " A staggering feature of India is its regional economic inequality. While states like Goa, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana are highly prosperous (along with the Union Territories of Delhi, Chandigarh and Puducherry), the eastern, north eastern and central states are lagging behind in terms of both economic and human development indicators. For instance, Goa had a per capita net state domestic product (NSDP per capita) of Rs. 467,998 at 2011 -2012 prices in 2018 -2019 , Haryana (at Rs. 226, 644) and Puducherry (at Rs. 220, 461) . At the other extreme, Bihar had a current Rupee per capita NSDP of just Rs. 43,822 in the same year which is just 9 per cent of the corresponding figure for Goa. 2 The discretionary transfers have not only grown as a proportion of revenue sharing with the states in recent years but have favoured states with higher per capita income. This is particularly true for transfers from the Union government that are allocated in accordance with a matching formulae. 3 In terms of human development indicators the inter-state disparities are perhaps astonishing. Kerala and Goa with near hundred per cent total literacy rates had infant mortality rates of 7 and 8 respectively per 1000 live births in 2016-2017. 4 These are better figures compared to Turkey (at 8.6), Ukraine (at 7.2), Kazakhstan (at 9.3), Brazil (12.4), Mexico (12.2) , Thailand (at 7.7) and Malaysia (at 7.3). The corresponding figures for Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan stood at 38, 47 and 41, respectively, which is worse than Kenya at 34, Tanzania at 36, and Uganda with 44.7 (in 2019-2020 according to the World Bank). Coming to literacy, with just 70.9% total literacy rate, Bihar is 6.8% below the national average total literacy rate of 77.7%. Total literacy-wise Andhra Pradesh is currently at the bottom with 66.4%, followed by Rajasthan at 69.7%.\n",
            " In terms of Covid infections, India is currently ranked as one of the leading Covid-19 epicentres in the world in terms of the aggregate number of infections. Since September 15, 2020, this virus is on a decelerating trend but it has taken a nasty turn particularly at the time when this paper was completed. It is unlikely that this virus will go away on its own without immunization of at least 60 per cent of the nation's population. The good news is that alternative vaccines are in place but it is uncertain whether it will reach all the vulnerable belts of the country within a reasonable deadline. Our study covers the pandemic period until February 21 and has nothing to say about the present massive spikes in cases and fatalities. The key results and the policy conclusion that we reach may thus be tentative. We use the state-level cross section as well panel data to identify the possible clusters of Covid infections in India. Our data source is the real-time database available in www. covid 19ind ia. org. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive dataset for Covid infections in different regions of India which are widely used by researchers.\n",
            " Two key findings come out of our investigation. First, Covid infections are clustered in the rich and industrial states with a high population density. Agricultural regions have fewer infections. Since tests can only detect infections, we find that more tests are undertaken in relatively prosperous regions which is indicative of uneven development and lack of governance in poorer regions. This is confirmed by the fact that tests are lower in states where there is inferior law and order and higher infant mortality.\n",
            " The second robust finding from our study is that infections are uniformly lower in regions with greater poverty. This is true for both urban and agricultural states. This result stands in sharp contrast with the experience of the developed hemisphere including United States. Our tentative hypothesis for this difference in response of infections to poverty is the hygiene hypothesis well known in the epidemiology literature that poor in developing country like India have acquired herd immunity due to exposure to different types of infections from childhood.\n",
            " Our paper relates to a fast growing literature on the effect of poverty and inequality on the incidence of pandemic. There is no robust convincing evidence that inequality has a negative effect on health although inequality when combined with poverty may have detrimental effect on health due to unequal health care services (Deaton, 2013) . In the United States, black, Hispanic and indigenous population were exposed more to Covid infections than whites (Hoyer and Morrison, 2020). Using preliminary US county level analysis, Abedi et al. (2020) document that existing rates of poverty, disease and the presence of ethnic minorities were all associated with higher infection. UK also has similar experiences among black, Asian and Middle Eastern (known as BAME) groups (Office of National Statistics, 2020). Finch and Hernández Finch (2020) find that more disadvantaged counties in the United States had a larger number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, and that the number of Covid-19-related deaths was associated with poorer and more urban counties. Quite remarkably, they observe that the testing for the virus was less available in more disadvantaged counties. Viewed from this perspective, the experience of India in terms of the relationship between poverty and cases is unique. Our study parallels Davies (2021) who undertakes cross country analysis of Covid-19 death rates and finds that poverty has a weak negative association with case fatalities. Our focus is, however, on cases and not on fatalities. 5\n",
            " The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present a brief literature review of the extant studies on Covid 19 in India. In Sect. 3, we report the main pockets of infections in India and point to some possible developmental covariates of infections. In Sect. 4, we develop a simple SIR model to put some structure to our regression analysis and report cross sectional regressions of the possible determinants of infections with a focus on development indicators in each state. In Sect. 5, we undertake panel regressions to understand the dynamics of infections and the effect of removing lockdown restrictions. Section 6 addresses the question why richer states in India are testing more. Section 7 explores the relationship between poverty and infections. Section 8 concludes.\n",
            " A number of recent studies have examined the trend in Covid-19 infections in India and its regional disparity. Jalan and Sen (2020a) were amongst the first to systematically observe on the basis of district level data till the midnight of April 5, 2020, that not all of India had been impacted uniformly by the virus, and that there was a strong case in favour of implementation of a more selective lockdown. The heavily affected districts included the metro areas of Delhi, Mumbai, Indore, Jaipur, Chennai, and Pune. The 20 significantly affected districts included Agra, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Coimbatore, and Thane while 42 districts were moderately affected, and 188 districts were mildly affected. The unevenness in the spread of the virus was understood by the fact that Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, and an additional 16 per cent of all the districts in the rest of India together reported 86 per cent of all Covid cases in the country. 6 In a later study for the state of Kerala, Jalan and Sen (2020b) found that the state effectively managed its first Covid wave by formulating a comprehensive set of government actions that were supported and complied by the state's citizens. The authors maintain that this was achieved by leveraging and reinforcing the citizen's public trust in the state. The regional disparity in COVID infections in India has also been observed by Mandi et al. (2020) . They constructed a multi-dimensional vulnerability Index for Indian districts with an aim to provide a direction for sequential lifting of the lockdown. Ray and Subramanian (2020) also noted the regional disparity in infections although their key objective was to provide an interim report on the Indian lockdown provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            " Our central research question is: how do socioeconomic and macro development indicators explain infection differentials across Indian states? This key question largely remains unanswered in the extant studies. Moreover, these papers hardly undertake an econometric investigation of the macro developmental determinants of the regional disparity of cases in India during the first wave of this pandemic. In this respect, our study is novel.\n",
            " Our observations based on recent state-level panel data on Covid statistics reveal several important empirical regularities. Data for total confirmed cases and tests Probing further to understand how infections associate with various developmental indicators, we find that the incidence of this virus (in terms of confirmed cases per million state populations) is significantly more in prosperous states in terms per capita net domestic product (PCNSDP) and with higher degrees of urbanization. This is shown in Fig. 3 . 8 We capture urbanization with the help of percentage of urban population at the state level (as per Census 2011 figures). Higher levels of urbanization and economic development invariably result in higher population densities at the state level especially because urbanized states attract migrant workers and people from backward and poorer states. 7 Cut-off from India's mainland, the union territories of Lakshadweep and Ladakh are dropped as outliers in terms of Covid-19 infections and population density. Data on several variables of interest for the UTs of Daman and Diu as well as Dadra and Nagar Haveli are unavailable. 8 For line graph plotting, variables are normalized to a (0, 1) scale for each state by means of a UNDP-HDI type attainment index formula to facilitate comparison. This is simply the difference of the actual Not surprisingly, there is a close association between state-level tests per million and reported cases per million as seen in Fig. 4 . The correlation coefficient between Footnote 8 (continued) tests and cases is 0.65 and is statistically highly significant (see Table 1 ).\n",
            " The larger question is: which states are testing more? A part of it is answered in Fig. 4 itself which shows that more urbanised states are testing more and as a result getting more confirmed cases reported. The degree of state-level urbanization may be taken as an effective proxy for the level of economic development in the Indian context. Table 1 presents a few key bivariate correlation coefficients. Few points are worthy of attention. First, cases (CASES) are strongly associated with tests (TESTS). More prosperous, urban and densely populated states with better infrastructure report more infections. Tests are happening more in developed states with better infrastructure. Agricultural share in state GDP (AGRI) is negatively associated with both confirmed cases and tests. Moreover agriculturally dominant states tend to have lower population density (DENSITY) as well as lower levels of urbanization (URBAN).\n",
            " Second, poverty measured by percent people below poverty line (BPL) has a significant negative association with confirmed cases per million which indicates that poorer states tend to have lower infections per million. This comes as a surprise because it goes against a few extant studies based on UK and US which find poverty as a driver of infections due to lack of Covid-safe social distancing. 9 In India also, it is difficult for the low income citizens to maintain social distancing besides maintaining the desirable standards of personal health, hygiene and sanitation. However, it should also be borne in mind that poorer states get tested less as evidenced by a negative correlation between cases and BPL. \n",
            " Motivated by the correlation matrix in Table 1 and the spatial distribution map of infections, we next explore the structural determinants of infections. To fix ideas, we start off with a simple discretised version of a SIR model formulated by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) . Population normalized at unity is divided in three distinct groups at date t, (i) susceptible S t , (ii) infected I t and (iii) recovered R t where S t + I t + R t = 1. 10 The rate of new infections is S t I t if infected and susceptible meet at a contact rate . The rate of recovery is γ. The evolution of SIR population is given by the relationship as follows:\n",
            " where ΔI t = I t+1 − I t with γ ∈ (0,1), > 0 . A t is a public health policy variable which depends on the quality of health care and availability of an efficacious vaccine. Everything else equal, the higher the A t , the lower the infections. The effectiveness of the policy in lowering infection is characterized by the parameter . We add a social distancing dimension to this SIR model. The contact between S t and I t groups is determined by social distancing ( D t ) . The higher the D t , the lower the contact S t I t . Let us posit:\n",
            " where c is a positive constant. Combining (1) and (2), we get a simple reduced form infection equation:\n",
            " The left hand side of (3) is the cumulative infection which depends inversely on social distancing. The social distancing ( D t ) is a behavioural variable which depends on a range of developmental and policy variables including lockdown.\n",
            " The steady state timeless version of (3) is:\n",
            " where a 0 = c −1 , a 1 = −1 and a 2 = −1 . Motivated by the reduced form infection Eq. (4), we first run a log-linear crossstate regressions in Table 2 to focus on various developmental determinants of infections across India. We choose PCNSDP, URBAN, DENSITY, BPL and AGRI as explanatory developmental variables.\n",
            " Few observations in Table 2 lend themselves for attention. First, level of urbanization and PCNSDP have significant positive influence over infections-a robust finding across all specifications. Second, the agricultural share in state GDP has a (1)\n",
            " 10 Since our focus is on Covid infections, we ignore deaths from this model.\n",
            " Log-linear regression of confirmed cases per million for 33 states and Union Territories in India Source: Estimated by the authors on the basis of secondary data\n",
            " (1) Numbers in the parentheses are t ratios where HAC adjusted standard errors are used in all cases. **means significant at 1% level and **means significant at 5% level.\n",
            " (2) The total state level confirmed cases and tests per million population are for 21-02-2021 Dependent variable: Log(Cases) dampening effect on confirmed cases. In other words, agrarian states tend to have lower infections. Third, BPL has a negative effect on infections significant at the 5% level. When BPL is interacted with URBAN, we find that it mutes the positive effect of urbanization on infections. This observation points to a potent testable hypothesis that people below poverty line living in more dense and urban areas may be resilient to this nasty virus. In other words, there is a nonlinear interaction between poverty and urbanization in determining infections. 11 In a nutshell, this cross section regression suggests that Covid infections are highly concentrated in more prosperous, urbanized (i.e., relatively more developed) and densely populated states. Poverty lowers infections and it mutes the positive effects of urbanization on infections. Agrarian states in India have lower population density and thus lower levels of urbanizations leading to lower infections per million. The percentage of work force engaged in agriculture (WFA) in the total labour force introduced in Model 5 adds new insights that explain the limited spread of the covid in agriculturally dominant states. Controlling for per capita NSDP, WFA shows a significantly negative influence over confirmed cases, implying that when income is controlled higher proportions of workers engaged in agriculture and allied activities control the spread of the virus to a significant extent. For instance, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, each with more than 70% work force engaged in agriculture and allied activities are amongst the lowest Covid-19 affected in the country.\n",
            " WFA is significantly negatively associated with urbanization as seen in correlations in Table 5 . The chance of Covid transmission is significantly lower in states with a higher agricultural dominance (measured both in terms of WFA and AGRI) due to lower population density. On the other hand, more urbanised states, (which are also states with greater proportion of formal sector or urban sector workers) have greater potentials of Covid-19 spread due to the failure to maintain ideal social distancing norms, as ideal social distancing practices in India are difficult to maintain in a fast and unrestricted urban life. In a nutshell, the poor and backward agrarian states may be practicing what may be called \"natural social distancing\" due to lower population density which explains less infections in these regions.\n",
            " We next run a dynamic panel regression motivated by (3) involving the same 33 states and UTs weekly data starting March 2020 till February 21, 2021 (47 weekly observations for each state yielding 1551 pooled observation). The results shown in Table 3 reinforce the observations of the cross-section regressions of Table 2 and 11 Similar nonlinearity is also found in Basu et al. (2021) who find that people socially distance less than rich in poorer and more densely populated districts in England. (1) Numbers in the parentheses are t ratios which use White's diagonally corrected standard errors throughout. **means significant at 1% level and *means significant at 5% level. give additional insights. A one period lag of log of cases is introduced throughout to eliminate serial correlation in accordance with SIR Eq. (3). In addition, we introduce an \"unlock\" dummy (UNLOCK) that takes the value unity for post July 1, 2020 observations and 0 otherwise, to demarcate the pre and post unlock 2 phases in India. The sign of the \"unlock\" dummy will capture the effect of less policy stringency of social distancing on infections.\n",
            " Few important observations are in order. First, the significantly high lagged coefficient of regression is indicative of the persistent nature of infections. One per cent rise in infections in the previous week is associated with at least 0.88 percent increase infections in the current week. Second, the \"unlock\" phase has significantly added to Covid confirmed numbers at the state level as seen in models 2 to 4 'UNLOCK coefficient is positive and significant. Finally, other things unchanged, higher poverty rates at the state level lead to uniformly lower infections which is a consistent finding across both cross-section and panel regression models.\n",
            " Finally we repeat our panel estimation of a similar family of log-linear regression models (see Table 4 ) but this time with the log differenced confirmed cases per million state population (which captures the weekly new cases per million) as the dependent variable. To capture the nonlinearity of the weekly count curve over time during March 2020 to February 2021, we insert time and time-squared as regressors and drop the 'unlock' dummy. Even though differencing introduces greater variability in the data, it is noteworthy that the negative BPL coefficient is still significant at the 10% level. The results are overall consistent with Tables 2 and 3. Time has a significantly positive coefficient and time-squared has a negative coefficient. In other words, new infections show an inverted U-shaped pattern meaning that it peaks and then dies out. The one period lagged coefficient is also akin to the previous regressions showing persistence in new infections and this pattern is consistent across all these four models. 6 Why are rich states getting tested more?\n",
            " Since TESTS and PCNSDP show strong positive correlation as seen in Table 1 , a natural question arises why are tests so much concentrated in prosperous regions of India? Do these regions have a better health infrastructure and better governance? States which are better governed and have a more robust public health policy are likely to undertake more tests. To this end, we take infant mortality rate (IMR) as a proxy for the adequacy of the public health infrastructure. In the Indian context, IMR is taken as a proxy for the state-level backwardness in terms of general health status and health infrastructure. Thus regions with lower infant mortality rate are likely to have a better health infrastructure and arguably better health status. Regarding governance, we pick the total crime rate (TCR) as a proxy for governance keeping in mind that TCR reflects reported and government recorded crime. Crimes reported but unregistered by officials are not included in TCR. In our view, better governance leads to more reported and registered crimes and so better governance may be reflected in higher TCR. 12 The correlations reported in Table 5 reveal that, high IMR states tend to have low TCR. Furthermore, the fact that URBAN and PCNSDP are positively associated with TCR but negatively with BPL and AGRI implies that while richer and developed states report and register more crimes, poorer states and states with higher AGRI do not. These are supportive of our idea of taking TCR as a proxy for governance. Strong positive correlations of TCR with PCNSDP and URBAN suggests that developed states in India tend to report more crimes and thus have relatively better standards of governance. In addition, the fact that high IMR basically captures state-level backwardness is understood from its significantly negative association with URBAN and PCNSDP (each of which are strong socio-economic development indicators on its own merit) besides its positive association with BPL (and even AGRI). In other words, developed states tend to have low IMR and this gives sufficient justifications for choosing IMR as an indicator of state-level backwardness. Table 6 presents the results of a dynamic log-linear panel regression of tests with TCR and IMR and URBAN as three variables capturing state-level fixed effects. After controlling for the serial correlation in tests (by addition lagged test variable as a regressor), the state-level infrastructure and governance variables are significant determinants of tests. States with better health and urban infrastructure and better governance carry out more tests which is consistent with the bivariate correlations reported in Table 1 .\n",
            " What is surprising is the response of infections to poverty. Poor people are less susceptible to infections in India which is a robust finding of our study. This finding stands in sharp contrast with the experience of the developed countries, particularly USA and UK where low income essential workers are more affected by the virus compared to the rest of the population. What are the possible reasons for this stark difference in response of infections to poverty in India compared to the developed counterpart of the world? Two hypotheses lend themselves. First, it is possible that poor states are testing less and thus less infections are reported there. This possibility cannot be ruled out given that correlation coefficient between BPL and cases is negative in Table 1 and it is mildly significant statistically.\n",
            " The second hypothesis is the hygiene hypothesis first introduced by the epidemiologist Strachan (1989) who found that children in larger households contracted less hay fever because they are exposed to germs from older siblings. Further research suggested that lack of early childhood exposure to unhygienic environments can make the adults more vulnerable to various kinds of infections. 13 It is not implausible to hypothesize that in India poor may be immune to various kinds of infections due to unhygienic living conditions from early childhood while in the developed world, the basic health infrastructure permits low income people to access clean and germ free environment from their childhood. Although this hygiene hypothesis is just a conjecture and it needs greater scrutiny, we tend to subscribe to it for the following reasons. We have computed the correlation between case fatalities and the level of development. The correlation coefficient between PCNSDP and FATALITY is a staggering 0.76 which is highly significant implying that the richer states have experienced the highest death rates. In other words, better off people in India died more of Covid cases.\n",
            " We also have some anecdotal evidence to support this hygiene hypothesis. In India, supply of semi-skilled and unskilled migrant workers engaged in Construction as well as Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) comes from distant rural areas. Under severe distress these migrant workers were forced to leave these urban centres (not just Delhi alone) during the first wave and stringent phase of the lockdowns (i.e., 25th March to 14th April, 2020) resulting in the 'infamous' mass urban-rural exodus in India. It is noteworthy that despite this mass movement of migrant workers, the Covid did not spread significantly to poor and backward northern states (mostly Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh) from where the migrant workers mostly originate. This event reinforces our claim on herd immunity among the poor sections of the society.\n",
            " Our study shows that Covid infections have significant regional disparity in India. Infections are more concentrated in prosperous Indian states with higher levels of urbanization coupled with high population density. By default, agrarian states have been affected less on account of lower levels of population density and urbanisation. Second, we find that tests also display significant regional disparity. Prosperous states with a better health infrastructure and governance undertake more tests and this also explains why more infections are reported in these regions. Third, a robust finding is that poverty has a dampening effect on infections which suggests some degree of herd immunity among the poor as well as less tests done in poor states.\n",
            " Our dynamic panel regressions based on the first wave of the pandemic suggest that infections are persistent and new infections seemed to reach plateau and then started declining. Evidently this dynamics has now reversed with the new wave of infections which is beyond the scope of our study. The unlock phase during the post July 2020, has added significantly to state-wise Covid numbers. The policy lesson that we learn from this exercise is that, the authority should continue to monitor densely populated urban areas without compromising the standard of Covid prevention protocols including the rates of testing in poor, remote and backward Indian states.\n",
            " Although a couple of efficacious vaccines are already in place, the universally accepted Covid protocols of safe social distancing with mandatory preventive measures as masks and sanitizers are the only means of decelerating the rate of spread of Covid infections. As new official reports about the spread of a more potent and virulent strain of this virus arrive, it is crucially important that crowds and gatherings are controlled and Covid surveillance practices are aggressively stepped up by state governments including punitive actions in all cases of violations. After all, Covid prevention and control is an issue that is inextricably linked with the quality and efficiency of governance at the local levels together with the efficacy of the vaccines.\n",
            " Our study can be extended further. We have focused on the first wave of infections and only looked at cases not fatalities. Given the present trend in Covid-19 now, it is important to explore the dynamics and regional variation of case fatalities in India. Such a study also requires careful modelling of multiple Covid cycles using the SIR framework.\n",

            "Title: Age-Dependent Glycomic Response to the 2009 Pandemic H1N1 Influenza Virus and Its Association with Disease Severity\n",
            "Body Text: Influenza A viruses cause a spectrum of responses from mild coldlike symptoms to severe respiratory illness and death. 1 Both viral strain and intrinsic host factors, such as age, influence disease severity. 2 In general, infants, young children, and individuals older than 65 are more likely to have severe clinical outcomes upon influenza infection. However, during pandemic outbreaks, influenza viral strains can emerge that shift the age-dependent infection patterns. In 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza strain (H1N1pdm09) arose that caused severe clinical symptoms more frequently in older children and adults than in young children and the elderly. 3 Although the lower severity observed in young children is not clearly understood, the loss of severity observed in the elderly population was attributed to pre-existing immunity. Prior waves of seasonal and pandemic influenza strains generated antibodies in the older exposed population that neutralized the H1N1pdm09 virus, generating a more productive existing immunity, which lessened severity.\n",
            " The ferret model of influenza mimics clinical outcomes for the H1N1pdm09 across the age spectrum. 4−6 Ferrets are an attractive animal model for influenza, as they share similar lung physiology to humans and recapitulate the pathology observed in clinical populations. In addition, human influenza viruses efficiently replicate in ferrets without the need for adaptation, enabling study of the original viral strains. 7 This is because ferrets contain the receptor for human influenza, α-2,6-sialic acids, in their upper respiratory tracts. The similarities between the glycans in the respiratory tract of ferrets to those observed in humans make this a good model to study glycomic changes in response to influenza infection. 8, 9 Glycosylation plays an important role in influenza infection and host response. 10, 11 Adhesion of viral hemagglutinin (HA) to host receptors containing terminal α-2,6-sialic acids located in the upper respiratory tract is the first step in the infection process. Release of viral particles requires viral neuraminidases (NA) to cleave sialic acids. 12 This enzyme is the target of current therapeutics against influenza. 13, 14 Because of the importance of HA, NA, and sialic acid in influenza biology, the majority of glycomic analysis has focused on these molecules.\n",
            " In recent work, our laboratory analyzed the glycomic response to H1N1pdm09 in an adult ferret population using our lectin microarray technology. 15 We found that the severity was not related to sialic acid levels but, rather, correlated with the expression of high mannose N-glycans. Histology on ferret lungs showed high mannose levels corresponded with alveolar severity and was present throughout the tissue on multiple cell types. Infection of human lung epithelia with H1N1pdm09 in cell culture recapitulated the increased high mannose observed in ferrets. This glycan signature was found to be cell surface and was upregulated on both viral and host glycoproteins. Expression of high mannose was shown to be downstream of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which has been shown to play a role in influenza severity. 16 This glycan motif is the recognition element for a number of innate lectins that activate the immune system. The complement-inducing lectin MBL2, which binds high mannose, has been strongly associated with influenza severity. 17, 18 We have shown direct, high mannose-dependent binding of MBL2 to influenza infected cells. On the basis of our work we hypothesize that high mannose, induced via the UPR pathway, may play a causative role in the damage associated with MBL2 in influenza. It is unknown whether this mechanism might underlie age-related differences in severity.\n",
            " In this work, we examine glycomic changes, including high mannose, upon infection with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 strain of influenza in ferret models of young children and the elderly. Since their introduction in 2005, 19 lectin microarrays have been used to perform glycomic analysis on a wide variety of samples from microvesicles 20 to human tissues. 21 Herein, we analyze the glycomic response to H1N1pdm09 infection in newly weaned and aged ferrets using our dual-color lectin microarray technology. 22 We also compare the baseline glycomes of newly weaned, adult, and aged ferrets. Our data suggest that differences in the glycome, in particular, in the high mannose response, may help explain in part the variation in clinical outcomes as a function of age in influenza infection.\n",
            " Fitch ferrets (Mustela putorius f uro, female) were obtained from Triple F Farms (Sayre, PA) and verified as negative for antibodies to circulating influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B viruses. Newly weaned ferrets were defined as 6−7 weeks of age, adult ferrets as 6−12 months of age, and aged ferrets as 5.5−7 years of age. Ferrets were pair-housed in stainless steel cages (Shor-Line) containing Sani-Chips laboratory animal bedding (P.J. Murphy Forest Products) and provided with food and fresh water ad libitum. Newly weaned and adult ferrets were administered intranasally the H1N1pdm09 virus, A/California/07/2009 (Influenza Reagents Resources (IRR), BEI Resources, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) at a dose of 10 6 PFU. Aged ferrets were infected at a dose of 10 5 PFU. The animals were monitored daily for weight loss and disease symptoms, including elevated temperature, low activity level, sneezing, and nasal discharge. Animals were randomly assigned to be sacrificed at day 1, 3, 5, 8, or 14 postinfection (DPI) or euthanized if their clinical condition (e.g., loss of >20% body weight) required it.\n",

            " Clinical outcomes and susceptibility to influenza infection vary with age. 25, 26 Given the role host glycans play in influenza infection and in the immune response, we characterized the baseline glycosylation in the lungs of uninfected female ferrets from three age categories: newly weaned, adult, and aged. Newly weaned ferrets were defined as those from six to seven weeks of age. The course of H1N1pdm09 infection in this ferret population mirrors that observed clinically in young children, that is, a mild to moderate presentation of symptoms. 5 Adult ferrets, defined as 6−12 months of age, have more varied responses to H1N1pdm09 infection ranging from mild to severe, again in line with human populations. 4 In aged ferrets, defined as 5.5−7 years of age, severe outcomes are seen in more than 50% of animals infected with H1N1pdm09. 6 This is in line with the higher severity seen in aged populations from influenza A infections in general. 29, 30 However, it does not match clinical observations in the aged human population for the H1N1pdm09 strain. This difference is accounted for by pre-existing immunity in the aged human population. Infection by earlier pandemic-like H1N1 viruses is thought to have elicited cross-reactive antibodies that neutralized the virus, moderating the severity of H1N1pdm09 in the older population. 27, 28 In contrast, the aged ferrets in our study are a naive population with no pre-exposure to influenza. Thus, we observe the more severe influenza response typical of influenza A infections in the elderly with no preimmunity. We analyzed the baseline expression level of host glycans prior to influenza virus infection in lung punch biopsies from newly weaned (NW, n = 6), adult (AD, n = 4), and aged ferrets (AG, n = 3) using our dual-color lectin microarray technology (Scheme 1). 22, 23 Biopsies from both the upper and lower lobes were analyzed for each ferret. Lectin microarrays utilize carbohydrate-binding proteins with well-defined specificities to detect glycan changes between samples. 19,22−24 In brief, frozen tissue samples were sonicated and labeled with either Alexa Fluor 555-NHS (sample) or Alexa Fluor 647-NHS (reference). A pooled reference consisting of all the samples was used. Equal amounts of sample and reference were analyzed on the lectin microarrays (>100 probes, Supporting Information, Table S1 ). A heatmap of the normalized data, ordered by ferret age, is shown in Figure 1a .\n",
            " Sialic acid glycoconjugates on the host cell surface play a crucial role as both the receptor for influenza binding by hemagglutinin (α-2,6-sialosides) and as the target of the influenza neuraminidase (α-2,3-and α-2,6-sialosides). Differences in sialoside levels may play a role in differential susceptibility to the virus with age. In light of this we examined the expression level of α-2,3and α-2,6-sialosides in the ferret lung. Both newly weaned and aged ferret lungs had higher levels of α-2,6-sialosides than adult lungs (lectins: SNA, TJA-I, ∼1.3-fold NW/AD, ∼1.4-fold AG/AD, Figure 1b and Supporting Information, Figure S1 ), indicating that they may be more susceptible to viral infection. In contrast to α-2,6-sialic acid, we observed a significant age-dependent decrease in α-2,3-sialosides (lectin: MAL-II (∼1.5-fold NW/AD, ∼2-fold NW/AG), SLBR-N, 31 diCBM40, SLBR-H, 31 Figure 1c and Supporting Information, Figure S2 ). Of particular note, the lectin MAL-II mainly recognizes α-2,3-sialic acids on O-linked glycans. These glycans commonly decorate proteins such as mucins, whose heavily sialylated structures often act as a trap for viral particles. 32 While a decrease in α-2,3-sialosides is observed with age, we also observed an increase in mucin levels in the lungs (Antibodies: MUC5AC, MUC15, Supporting Information, Figure S3 ). In addition, we observed a potentially related increase in Lewis structures (Le), which often decorate mucins (Antibodies: Le b , Le X , Le Y , Supporting Information, Figure S4 ). Taken together, our data suggest that the protective, highly sialylated mucins, 33−35 which allow clearance of the virus from the lungs, may alter with age in a way that diminishes their protective capacity. These data correlate well with the differences in viral clearance observed in these ferrets, with young ferrets showing more rapid clearance and aged ferrets showing prolonged infection and lower clearance of the virus upon infection. 6 Recently, our group identified high mannose as a severity marker for influenza H1N1pdm09 infection in adult ferrets. 15 High mannose (defined here as Man 7−9 ) and oligo-mannose (defined as Man 5−7 ) are targets for innate immune lectin binding and may play a direct role in the damage observed in influenza. Analysis of the mannose binding lectins on the array showed distinct profiles for levels of high-and oligomannose. 36 Uninfected newly weaned animals had significantly lower levels of oligo-mannose (GNL, NPA, HHL) than either adult or aged ferrets (Figure 1d and Supporting Information, Figure S5 ). However, high-mannose levels, recognized by the antiviral lectin Griffithsin (GRFT), 37 were higher in the newly weaned and adult animals as compared to the aged ferrets. Whether age-dependent differences in the baseline levels of Journal of Proteome Research pubs.acs.org/jpr Article mannose in uninfected animals have any bearing on the levels induced during host response to influenza is currently unclear.\n",
            " Disease progression in adult and aged ferrets infected with H1N1pdm09 differs dramatically in timing and presentation. 6 Aged ferrets had more persistent viral infections and were unable to clear the virus by day 8 postinfection, in contrast to adults. They also developed pneumonia later in the course of their illness and had higher rates of mortality. To study the impact of glycosylation on the host response to influenza in the aged population, we performed lectin microarray analysis on lung punch biopsies from infected aged ferrets (age >5.5 Journal of Proteome Research pubs.acs.org/jpr Article years). We performed two concurrent studies: a severity study at day 8 postinfection (dpi 8, n = 29 ferrets) and a time-course analysis that included the day 8 samples (dpi 1: n = 5; dpi 3: n = 7; dpi 5: n = 12 ferrets, Scheme 2). Uninfected aged ferrets were used as a control (n = 3 ferrets). We analyzed two samples for each ferret.\n",
            " The animals analyzed in this study were the same animals for which pathology data were obtained in Bissel et al. 6 In our previous work, weight loss was used to evaluate the severity of illness. 6, 15 This is a common metric for severity in animal models and can only be used for time points at more than 5 d postinfection. In studying the disease progression in aged ferrets we observed a disparity between the pathology and the weight loss data. In this age group, a severe outcome by weight loss was defined as greater than 20% loss of mass. 6 A pneumonia composite score, which sums the scores for lung involvement, bronchial severity, and alveolar severity, was used to evaluate severity by pathology. 6 In aged animals, which present with pneumonia at later stages of infection, degree of severity by pathology cannot be determined for early time points. A comparison of the severity as defined by weight loss quartiles (Q0-Q1: <18.3%, Q1-Q3: 18.3%−21.9%, Q3-Q4: >21.9%, Supporting Information, Figure S6 ) to the pneumonia composite scores at day 8 showed no concordance between the two metrics. Instead, in the aged population the trend was toward lower weight loss with increased severity by pathology. This is in direct opposition to the trend observed in adult ferrets. On the basis of our analysis, weight loss was not an appropriate metric for severity in aged ferrets. Thus, the pneumonia composite score was used as the severity metric for this cohort, as it represents the physiologically relevant degree of illness in influenza infection. We used quartiles to define mild, moderate, and severe infections in the aged population (Mild: PCS < 8.5, n = 6 ferrets; Moderate: PCS = 8.5−11, n = 15; Severe: PCS > 11, n = 8). A heat map of the normalized data for ferrets sacrificed at day 7−8 postinfection arranged by severity is presented in Figure 2 . A heat map of the time-course analysis for aged ferrets is shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S7 .\n",
            " We observed several changes in aged ferrets as a function of infection that did not overlay onto severity. For ease of comparison between the aged and adult host responses, we reanalyzed the lectin microarray data from our adult ferret cohort 15 using PCS as the severity metric. In our previous work, adult ferrets showed an increase in α-2,6 sialylation at early infection time points, with levels returning to baseline by day 8 postinfection. In contrast, we see a significant loss of α-2,6 sialylation in the aged ferret lungs with this loss occurring early in the course of infection (SNA, TJA-I, Figure 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S8) . We also observe a loss in α-2,3-sialosides by day 8 postinfection in aged animals (SLBR-B, SLBR-H, SLBR-N, diCBM-40, MAL-I, MAL-II, Figure 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S9) . A similar loss of α-2,3-sialosides was observed in the adult ferrets. However, in this population, the response was immediate, while in the aged animals a more gradual loss of this glycan was observed. Influenza neuraminidases are known to prefer α-2,3-sialosides, 38, 39 and the more gradual loss of this glycan in aged ferrets maps onto the pattern of delayed infection observed in the lungs. 6 Uninfected aged animals had higher levels of nonsialylated mucins compared to adults. Upon infection, we observed a substantial loss of O-linked glycans, Lewis structures, and mucins in aged ferrets (AIA, HAA, HPA, MPA, MNA-G, Mucin 15, Le a , Le b , Le Y , Figure 2 and Supporting Information, Figure S10 ). This is similar to previous observations made in adult ferrets; however, the degree of response in the aged ferrets was more pronounced. We observed a strong loss of Olinked glycans, Lewis structures, and mucins at the earliest time points (Supporting Information, Figure S11 ), which may contribute to the inability of older animals to effectively fight infection.\n",
            " Our recent work strongly suggests a role for high/oligomannose as a key mediator of influenza severity. 15 In our original analysis, the severity in the adult ferrets was defined by weight loss. Reanalysis of these data using pneumonia composite scores did not change the previously observed relationship between the high/oligo-mannose levels and severity (Supporting Information, Figure S12 ). We observe a similar increase in high mannose as a function of severity in the aged animals when severity is defined by pathology (GRFT, HHL, H84T, 40 NPA, GNA, ASA, Figure 2 , Figure 3 , and Supporting Information, Figure S12 ). However, the timing of high mannose induction in the aged ferrets is delayed when compared to adults. In the adult ferrets, high mannose was induced at day 1 postinfection in line with the damage observed by pathology. 6 In the aged ferrets, we observe significant changes in high mannose by day 3, which persisted to day 8 postinfection. This is consistent with the more delayed development of pneumonia in these animals. Overall, these data support high mannose as a marker and potential mediator of severity in the host response to influenza infection. The 2019 pandemic H1N1 virus presented with mild clinical symptoms in young children. 41−43 H1N1pdm09 infection in newly weaned ferrets mimic these clinical symptoms, with lower fevers and less weight loss. 5 Newly weaned ferrets clear the virus faster and have much lower levels of alveolar pneumonia. 6 We analyzed the glycosylation changes in the lungs of newly weaned ferrets (six to seven weeks) infected with H1N1pdm09, for which we had previously obtained pathology data. 6 To examine the changes in glycosylation over the course of the infection, we performed a time-course study (uninfected, n = 16; dpi 3, n = 4; dpi 5, n = 4; dpi 8, n = 42; dpi 14, n = 3, two samples per ferret). Severity was determined for day 8 samples using the PCS metric as previously described. A heat map of the time-course data, organized by severity for day 8 postinfection, is shown in Figure 4 . In contrast to both adults and aged ferrets, we saw no clear severity-dependent differences in the newly weaned animals at day 8 postinfection. We did observe an increase in complex Nglycan epitopes early in the course of infection, peaking by day 5 and returning to preinfection levels by day 8 (α-2,6-sialic acid: SNA; core fucose: LcH, PSA; bisecting branching: PHA-E, Calsepa, Figure 4 and Supporting Information, Figure S13 ). Although high/oligo-mannose trended with complex Nglycans in the time course, the changes were not statistically significant. Overall, the lack of strong changes in the glycome is consistent with the mild nature of illness observed in young ferrets, modeling the human population.\n",
            " In 2009, a new pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus emerged and displayed an unusual severity pattern, impacting adults more severely than young children or the elderly. The lower impact on the elderly population, who are typically at high risk for influenza severity, was later determined to be a result of preexisting immunity. The ferret model of influenza has been found to mimic the differences in age-dependent illness observed in the absence of pre-existing immunity. In this model, there is a gradient of severity with young ferrets showing mild illness and aged ferrets displaying high severity, as would be expected in an influenza-naive aged human population. The origins of this disparity in host response is still unclear. In this work, we show dramatic age-dependent differences in the ferret glycome and host response to influenza that overlay differences observed in severity. These include age-dependent differences in mucin-related epitopes that may explain differences in viral clearance observed between populations. In recent work, we posited that the induction of high mannose due to influenza infection could be causative of severity through overengagement of the innate immune system via lectins, such as MBL2. Our current study shows that high mannose is induced in the aged population, where high levels of severity are observed, but not in newly weaned ferrets, which display a mild phenotype. This is consistent with our current hypothesis and points to the need for further study to determine if the glycomic host response is a critical mediator of influenza severity. . Newly weaned ferrets undergo glycan changes early in response to influenza. Median normalized log 2 ratios (Sample (S)/Reference(R)) of newly weaned (six to seven weeks of age) ferret lung samples were ordered by days post infection. Uninfected (blue), n = 16, two samples per ferret; day 3 (salmon), n = 4, two samples per ferret; day 5 (magenta), n = 4, two samples per ferret; day 8, ordered by severity (mild, yellow; moderate, orange; severe, red), n = 42, two samples per ferret; day 14 (maroon), n = 3, two samples per ferret.

            "Title: Changes in General and Virus-Specific Anxiety during the Spread of COVID-19 In Israel: A Seven-Wave Longitudinal Study\n",
            "Body Text: Wuhan, China. 1 The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January and as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 . COVID-19 commonly present as cold symptoms (cough ,fever, malaise, myalgias), gastrointestinal symptoms, and anosmia, but may exacerbated into shortness of breath, severe pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. Men, the elderly and people with pre-existing medical conditions are most vulnerable to severe illness. 2 As of writing these words, during July, 2021, effective vaccines are used to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and Israeli is leading in terms of offering them to the public. Up until the emergence of these vaccines, however, the only preventive treatment was behavioral, and includes hygiene, physical-distancing, masks-wearing, and large-scale societal measures ranging from targeted quarantine to general lockdowns. 3, 4 . Because some variants of COVID-19 appear This is the 1 st report from the COVID-19-Israeli Public Behavior Project (COVID-19-IPBP), a project aimed at documenting the Israeli public's reaction to the pandemic, with a focus on compliance, public trust, resilience, and emotional distress. An integrated conceptual framework guiding this study was utilized, drawing from behavioral medicine, psychology and psychiatry, and public health. In this first report from COVID-19-IPBP, we utilized data from the 1 st wave of the spread (although we have been, and still are, collecting data). Herein we report on the Israeli public's anxiety, a key factor in populations' behavior during medical crises such as mass-vaccination, plagues, and global hostilities 6 .\n",
            " Anxiety is largely considered a negative force, usually a clinical outcome of the crisis 7 . It is construed as an alarming outcome among medical teams 8 , as well as a factor derailing the public's compliance with instructions issued by policy makers 7 . Importantly, some levels of fear which are compatible with the medical threat are expected in the public, and some levels of anxiety can act to positively encourage people to adhere to guidelines. Nevertheless, extreme levels of fear and anxiety, tantamount to \"panic\", are likely to exacerbate the spread of epidemics and pandemics 9 . At the same time, low levels of anxiety may be associated with an underestimation of the medical threat, and often represent \"complacency \" 10,11 . The latter might hinder preparedness 10 , and compliance with governments' instructions, such as those concerning social distancing 11 .\n",
            " Because most pandemic-anxiety research is cross-sectional, not enough is known about trajectories of public anxiety during pandemics. However, one longitudinal study revealed that, in response to the H1N1 pandemic, anxiety increased rapidly, but then rapidly decreased 12 .\n",
            " Moreover, responses to the Ebola epidemic (distinguishable from H1N1 and COVID-19, which are pandemics) appear to reflect immediately high anxiety that was increasing further 13 .\n",
            " We investigated a large cohort of Jewish-Israeli adults over six weeks, using seven weekly assessments. The first assessment (Wave 0) transpired two days prior to the identification of the first COVID-19 carrier in Israel. We assessed general and virus-specific anxiety, demographics, and other variables not pertinent to the present report. Charting changes in general vs. virus-specific anxiety, we compared three hypothetical models:\n",
            " (1) A \"Panic Model\", evincing extreme levels of anxiety, either starting at a low level and increasing very fast or as high anxiety already appearing from the outset.\n",
            " (2) A \"complacency model\", in which general and virus-specific anxiety start and stay relatively low, i.e., not exceeding the mid-level of the scales.\n",
            " (3) A \"threat-sensitivity model\", a title developed specifically for this study. This model reflects a linear increase in anxiety which is commensurate with the increase in the threat (see 9 ).\n",
            " It should be noted that all three possibilitiesand of course additional onesmay occur concurrently at any single population, reflecting a heterogeneous public response to COVID-19. We allowed for this possibility in our analyses (see below).\n",
            " To summarize, the three goals of the present study are:\n",
            " (1) To identify various trajectories of anxiety in the investigated population during the 1 st wave of the spread of COVID-19 in Israel.\n",
            " (2) To characterize individuals belonging to the various trajectories using baseline anxiety and demographic variables.\n",
            " (3) To examine the direction of relationships between general and virus-specific anxiety. We were particularly interested in examining the predictive effect of baseline virus-specific anxiety on trajectories of general anxiety. Such an effect would suggest that at least some of the change in general anxiety during the 1 st wave of the spread is attributable to the spread itself, rather than to preexisting conditions.\n",

            " Two outcomes were considered: general and virus-specific anxiety, assessed at the first post-detection assessment (Week 1), for the subsequent six assessment waves. Because we anticipated heterogeneous responses to the coronavirus, we estimated latent class growth analyses (LCGAs) and growth mixture models (GMMs) in a structured search, separately for each of the two outcomes.\n",
            " Analyses were conducted following recommendations by Jung and Wickrama 20 . In addition, we also followed van de Schoot, Sijbrandij, Winter, Depaoli, and Vermunt, 21 , who provided guidelines for reporting on latent trajectory studies (i.e., GRoLTS-Checklist). In Figure   2 we present a flowchart of the various stages employed, linking these stages to Jung and Wickrama 20 . In Web Table 5 we detail our compliance with the GRoLTS-Checklist.\n",
            " Before addressing the Jung and Wickrama's 20 recommendations, we employed a visual inspection of individual trajectory plots. Many plots showed a conspicuous inflection point at the fifth assessment (-Week 4‖) for both outcomes, with individual trajectories tending to show a leveling off after increasing to that point.\n",
            " Given the above-mentioned visual inspection, we based our models on a piecewise functional form, with linear change before and after a spline knot at the fifth assessment.\n",

            " We then employed GMMs, for which the homogeneity of the within-class VCVs is relaxed. Because we hypothesized trajectories near the floor and/or ceiling of the scale, we decided a priori to allow the variance-covariance (VCV) matrix of the growth factors to differ between classes, as variances would be expected to be lower the nearer the means are to the scale endpoints. This was then followed by estimating models with the VCV matrices constrained to equality, both to improve estimability and to serve as a sensitivity analysis.

            " We predicted class membership via respondent age (grouped), gender, religiosity (binary), and education (binary: degree completed), as well as both general and virus-specific anxiety from the first assessment. Employment was not entered into this analysis because there was little variability: 92% were employed. Prediction was tested using the 3-step method incorporated into the R3STEP option in Mplus. This procedure automates the prediction of individual class membership based on the original mixture models incorporating individual-level uncertainty in class assignment 22 . We computed odds ratios and confidence intervals for the effect of each predictor in the multiple multinomial regression on likelihood of membership in each class, contrasted pairwise with every other class. Because this pairwise examination resulted in more contrasts than degrees of freedom, we applied Holm's family-wise error rate correction, separately for each predictor 23 \n",

Documenting the unfolding of general anxiety, as well as specific anxiety concerning the virus, was therefore essential.\n",
            " For both general and virus-specific anxiety, our hypothesized three classes emerged: (1) a threat-sensitive class evincing a linear increase till Week 4, then plateauing (29% and 66%, for each outcome, respectively), (2) a complacency model, characterized by low (general and virusspecific) anxiety slightly increasing over the study period (29% and 9%, respectively), and (3) a third, panic class starting very high and increasing in a linear fashion close to the ceiling (12% and 25%, respectively). In addition, for general anxiety, a non-hypothesized, albeit large (30%) and highly intriguing, fourth class emerged, evincing stable, mid-levels of general anxiety throughout the study period. We now discuss the implications of each of these classes in turn.\n",
            " The two extreme classes in each outcomelow and high anxiety --can be said to reflect the hypothesized complacency and panic trajectories. As for the low anxiety class, although it did not pertain to a straight line, the linear increase in this class was so modest (and culminating in a low anxiety level at the last wave) to be deemed as reflecting complacency: Despite the apparent threat, 29% of our sample were unperturbed in terms of general anxiety, and 9% were not worried about the spread of the virus. As shown in previous research 10, 11 , complacency can be identifiable at times of medical crises, and it can be quite harmful.\n",
            " As for the high-anxiety class, it is consistent with a \"panic\" trajectory where levels of anxiety are high already for the start and are even increasing with time 9 . This interpretation, however, should be tempered given the possibility that a subset of the population (12% and 25%, for each outcome, respectively), may constantly suffer from high anxiety regardless of the\n",
            " circumstances. That this class is relatively small may explain previous research reporting the absence of panic at times of disasters and large-scale political crises 30 , in that these studies did not allow for the possibility of various classes of trajectories included in the their sample. In subsequent analyses, we are examining the public and mental health consequences of already belonging to the high-anxiety class.\n",
            " For both outcomes, a large class was consistent with the threat-sensitive model, according to which levels of general and virus-specific anxiety start normatively low, but increase in a linear fashion as the threat grows, and then plateauing. We construe this plateau as reflecting habituation. As described in the landmark paper by Thompson and Spencer 31 , habituation is a form of simple, nonassociative learning in which the magnitude of the response to a specific stimulus decreases with repeated exposure to that stimulus. It has been known for several decades that the magnitude of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation occurring in response to a stressor declines with repeated exposure to that same stressor, and this decline has been referred to as -habituation‖ in the stress neurobiology literature 32 .\n",
            " When general, but not virus-specific, anxiety was considered as the outcome, we also identified a non-hypothesized, large (30%), fourth class, in which mid-levels of general anxiety were evinced from the outset, remaining stable across the six assessments. We title this class Week 0 predictors of the various classes for each outcome were informative.\n",
            " Interestingly, while both general and virus-specific anxiety predictedin expected waysmembership in the general anxiety classes, only virus-specific anxiety predicted membership in the virus-specific anxiety classes. Indeed, in developing the assessment protocol, we were explicitly influenced by literature on perceived stress 15 , whereby virus-specific anxiety is \"a risk factor\" for general anxiety symptoms. Nevertheless, we also allowed for a reverse, or birelational/cross-lagged prospective association, because these prospective associations are often observed in psychopathology 33 . Our actual findings are consistent with the construal of virusspecific anxiety as the stressor, and with general anxiety as the stress-reactive outcome. This pattern is important because it suggests that some of the changes in general anxiety are attributable to anxiety about COVID-19.\n",
            " Second, gender markedly distinguished between participants membership in the classes pertaining to general, but not virus-specific anxiety: Women were decidedly more anxious than men, and their anxiety was more likely to place the in the panic class (and men'sin the complacency class). However, because such associations were found only for general anxiety, it is possible that these gender differences, well documented in previous research, are unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis.\n",
            " Third, older participants were more likely to belong to a general (but not virus-specific)\n",
            " low anxiety (i.e. complacency) class. Overall, the moderating role of age has been documented in previous research , concerning mass disasters 34 . We are not sure why older participants in our sample reported levels of anxiety that were that low, and whether such low-end anxiety does indeed reflect complacency.\n",
            " Implications for public health interventions are noteworthy. That a large subset of this sample was threat-sensitive in terms of both general and virus-specific anxiety suggests that this particular public may be an intense consumer of data regarding the spread, the infected, and the deceased. To the extent that this post-hoc speculation is correct, quantitative information provided by medical leadership, as opposed to dramatic declarations, should be at the forefront of messages to the public. Relatedly, that baseline levels of virus-specific anxiety predictedin the expected direction --subsequent membership in the general anxiety trajectory, highlight the need to assess anxiety that is specific to the unfolding medical crises at the earliest stages of such crises. As for the identification of the \"balanced\", general anxiety class, and the predictive associations involving gender and age, we refrain from pointing out public health implications until we ascertain that this class, and such predictive associations, are specific to the COVID-19\n",

            " One of the reasons why comparison of concentration between 2020 and 2019 alone could be misleading is because interannual meteorological variability plays an important role in determining NO2 concentration, particularly wind speeds as they regulate horizontal advection 1 . A 10% difference in wind speeds around 6.5m/s can cause a difference in NO2 column concentration by 10%, especially in winter season 1 . We chose 80m for the analysis because 80m is a typical height of the \"surface boundary layer\" in the planetary boundary layer. As the temperature profile shows diurnal cycle in a layer below 200m or 300m height, and 80m height is just the central height in the layer, where wind is not so strongly affected by the surface.\n",

During weeks 17 to 19, u was slower by 70% (mean 1.3m/s). Concurrently, compared to 2019, pblh was about 28% higher in the eight weeks preceding the lockdown and lower by about 13% in the eight weeks beginning with the lockdown. The variation in pblh is more important for surface observation than the satellite retrievals which are column based. \n",
            " Although OMI was designed for daily retrievals, since June 2007 it has suffered a so-called 'rowanomaly' where its radiance measurements in some field of views have been affected by obstruction 2 . As a consequence of \"row anomaly\", OMI is missing data for almost half of its observation range, so the world-wide coverage is currently achieved in about two-days 3 . In this study, we used the product, 'OMNO2d' version 3, from NASA's Giovanni portal wherein the row anomaly flagged pixel and image with more than 30% cloud-fractions have been filtered already. To further analyze the impact of such filtering, we checked the weekly frequency of valid daily retrievals over a sample location, (urban Delhi: 76.875°E, 28.375°N -77.625°E, 28.875°N) for 6 years (2015 to 2020) as shown in Error! Reference source not found. (a). Retrievals were the lowest in January (weeks 1 to 4, median: 3 /week) followed by February (weeks 4 to 8, median: 4/week) and December (weeks 48 to 52, median: 4/week). For all other months the median weekly frequency of daily retrievals was higher than 4. A frequency 5/week was judged to sufficiently represent the weekly concentration. Based on the lockdown phases. we were interested mainly the retrievals made during the first six months of a year. Coincidently, the lockdown was initiated from week 13 to 27, where the median weekly retrieval count is at least 5/week and the inferences made from OMI retrievals in these weeks could be used confidently. However inferences made for preceding weeks, especially those of January (weeks 1 to 4) could have higher uncertainties. The weekly mean NO2 concentrations at urban (Delhi) and rural (Fatehabad) for the weeks 1 to 27 are shown in Figure S4 (a) and (b). The seasonal is visually trend is similar to what has been reported earlier based on ground studies 4 . The relatively large standard deviation in the weeks (weeks 1 to 8) could be due to low number of retrievals in those weeks. \n",
            " It has been pointed out earlier that OMI retrievals are systematically lower than the groundbased Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) column measurements in strongly polluted areas and vice versa in low concentration areas 5 . TROPOMI retrievals have a tendency to slightly overestimate MAX-DOAS columns by 7% over clean regions (below 2 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 ) and underestimate by 36% over polluted regions (between 3 − 14 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 ), wherein low NO2 column values are better reproduced than high NO2 column values 6 . The bias is thus within the mission requirement of 50%. Global comparison between OMI and TROPOMI has revealed that due to the difference in pixel resolution, representativeness remains a major issue: OMI's larger ground pixels, particularly near the swath-edges different amounts of NO2 and of cloud cover 6 . Over polluted areas TROPOMI is lower than OMI's, with differences varying from a few to -40% (in the winter) while in very clean regions TROPOMI has higher values by about 20% 6 . Over India, the difference between OMI and TROPOMI, the bias of TROPOMI is − 0.2 ± 0.8 × 10 15 (1σ) molec/cm 2 , which is − 6% ± 21% in relative value 7 .\n",

The difference between the weekly mean of TROPOMI and OMI columns in 2019 was analyzed. Both the products showed a similar seasonality at urban and rural locations ( Figure  S5 ). Out of the 52 weeks of 2019, over urban (rural) areas 32 (36) weeks had at least 4 daily retrievals devoid of cloud or row-anomaly. Over the urban area, mean weekly difference between TROPOMI and OMI was 0.3 ± 1.3 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (6.4% ± 23.1%) , and was biased high during high pollution (regimes greater than 4.8 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 ), which often occurred during the winter months. Additionally, the difference and its deviation was lower (0.2±0.7 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 ) in the weeks when at least 4 daily valid retrievals existed. Over the rural region, TROPOMI was consistently lower than OMI by a mean value of 0.9 ± 0.8 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (39.9% ± 39.1%).

            " Furthermore, the relative difference in the concentrations between 2020 and 2019 from TROPOMI and OMI was also analyzed over the two locations (shown in Figure S6 ). The seasonal trend of the relative difference shows a greater consistency over the urban area compared to the rural area. Over the urban area, the mean relative difference (anomaly) in the pre-lockdown weeks (week 1 to week 12) of TROPOMI and OMI was −0.5 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (6.5%) and 0.1 × 10 15 molec/ cm 2 (13.5%) respectively, while in the lockdown weeks (week 13 to 27) was −2.2 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (-38.1%) and −1.9 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (−34.9%) respectively. Over the rural area, the mean relative difference (anomaly) of TROPOMI and OMI in the pre-lockdown weeks was 0.2 × 10 15 molec/ cm 2 (19.9%) and 0.3 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (22.3%) respectively, while in the lockdown weeks it stood at −0.4 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (-15.9%) and −0.3 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (−11.9%) This shows that although the difference of TROPOMI and OMI with regards to their relative difference or the anomaly was higher during the pre-lockdown months, the difference was lower during the lockdown period. It suggests that despite the underestimation in TROPOMI columns compared to the OMI columns, the calculated anomaly from both the sensors is quite similar and specially in lockdown weeks it is within 5% of each other. \n",

            " The mean top-down NOx emission rate inventory for the BAU is shown in Figure S10 . The total emission rate in the 300×600 km 2 domain was 18.34 kg/sec that corresponds to 1585.16 metric tons/day (by assuming constant diurnal emission rate). In 2020, the 60×60 km 2 region around central Delhi (not including Dadri power-plant) alone accounted for 2.78 kg/sec or 240.19 tons/day NOx emission. The same region in 2019 emitted 3.37 kg/sec or 291.16 tons/day. Spatially local peaks of the emission were found within 3 pixels (10 km) of the emission sources such as power-plants [PM1] . Emission clusters corresponding to strongly emitting power-plants, factories, highways are identifiable during BAU. Especially highways that radiate from Delhi have higher NOx emission due to vehicular traffic as well as industrial clusters along highways.\n",
            " Bottom-up and regional NOx emission inventories are often found to have been overestimated 30 . A reason for a higher emission estimation could be that the above-mentioned bottom-up studies report annual averages that did not consider seasonality of emissions. For example, power-failure leads to a greater use of diesel generators in Delhi during summers, hence higher diesel generator related emissions are during summer than winter. Non-consideration of such seasonal variation in emission may partially explain top-down emission estimation being lower than bottom-up emission inventory. \n",

            " Tropospheric NO2 retrievals suffer uncertainty in slant column density (due to measurement noise and spectral fitting errors), stratospheric slant column (due to error in separating stratospheric and tropospheric NO2) and tropospheric AMF (due to model parameter errors such as assumed profile shape 14 ) . The trace gas vertical profile is needed to derive VCD by separating AMF from SCD. Column uncertainty due to AMF is about 30% 14 . If the satellite retrieval assumed NO2 height profile has a smaller aerosol fraction close to surface compared to the true profile, then tropospheric AMF will be overestimated and correspondingly the retrieved tropospheric NO2 VCD will be underestimated 14 . Shaiganfar et al., (2011) compared OMI NO2 VCD with MAX-DOAS observations over Delhi and found that OMI retrievals underestimate high concentrations. Over highly polluted regions tropospheric NO2 VCDs are partially underestimated due to shielding of emitted NO2 by aerosols 5 . The random errors are reduced by temporal and spatial averaging, while a major part of systematic errors is expected to cancel out through the difference and ratio in the defined anomaly metric.\n",
            " Estimating D (divergence) and S (sink) is complicated mainly by the variation in wind fields and chemical transformation 9, 15 respectively, in addition to the tropospheric NO2 retrieval. As long as the wind has a constant speed and direction and these parameters are known with a high certainty, the steady-state assumption can be applied.\n",
            " [PM3]However slow winds which change directions with time and space complicate emission estimation as such scenarios have high uncertainty (relative to wind speed) and the sudden change in wind direction breaks the steady-state assumption. However, the error due to non-stationary state is smaller near point sources, which is further diminished by taking a multi-temporal mean. The NCEP modeled winds have an uncertainty of about 20% in speed and 14 o in direction 16 . Based on the sensitivity analysis by Beirle et al. 9 , the speed and direction uncertainty would lead to an uncertainty of 15% and a systematic low bias of 3% respectively in D. Another problem is that while the wind speeds and directions change with altitude, the vertical profile of the trace gas itself is not well-known. For example, the near-surface emissions (from vehicles) and chimney-stack emissions are injected at different altitude and their dispersion is subjected to different wind speeds. The vertical levels chosen for the wind fields result in an uncertainty of 10% in the corresponding D 9 . The total uncertainty due to the wind fields is the quadratic sum of 15% due to wind speed and 10% due to the plume height, amounting to about 20%.\n",
            " Chemical reaction rates may also add uncertainties in the assumed lifetime and the constant Leighton ratio. As stated earlier NO2/NOx ratio is lower when close to the freshly emitting source in space and time, which increases in aged plumes after chemical conversion 17 . Near strong emission sources emitted NO may not be quickly converted to NO2 if the NO mixing ratios locally exceed those of ozone. The NO/NO2 steady state is completely achieved only after ambient air has mixed with the emitted plume 5 . Turbulence in wind speed may enhance mixing and conversion of NO to NO2 near the source or it may disperse NO downwind before it gets converted to NO2 17 . We assumed a constant L (NOx/NO2) of 1.32 neglecting possible changes by day of the week. We assessed the uncertainty in assuming a constant ratio using NO and NO2 vertical column densities modeled from March to May, 2018 over Asia as part of another project, 'Japan's Study for Reference Air Quality Modeling' (J-STREAM) 18 . As shown in Figure S13 , L is lowest (~1.3) over polluted regions like urban areas (Delhi) and over a power-plant (Harduaganj) and is relatively high (~1.4), slightly decreasing between March to May. Standard deviation over polluted regions is 0.06 or about 5%.\n",

Such a variation only partially accounts for the changes in due to seasonality in actinic flux but neglects the changes due to different ozone concentrations on weekends 20 or during the lockdown 21 and dilution by wind. Uncertainty in this assumption was studied using the method of lifetime fit in which the downwind decay of NO2 from strong NOx emission sources was used for estimating the lifetime. This method was applied to randomly chosen date for each month between January to June over power-plants and urban areas. The lifetime so calculated were within 1.5 hours of the assumed the lifetime. The associated uncertainties in were therefore 30%.\n",

            "Body Text: Time series forecasting is an emerging topic with applications in diverse domains, e.g. business, medicine or energy. These approaches make use of time series data, which describes a system behavior by a sequence of observations within a certain time period and try to predict future values. However, sudden changes of the system behavior over time are common issues in time series analysis. These sudden changes can be either caused by external or internal influences, e.g. due to operational or strategic decisions.\n",
            " For instance, currently many sales forecasting systems are affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and energy demand predictions might be impeded by energetic optimizations of big consumers. Some but probably not all of the influential factors can be captured by features. Nevertheless, after a change of the generative data distribution, which reflects the relation between explanatory features and the target variable, predictions of a previously learned model might not be useful anymore. As a result, decisions based on these could cause damage such as a financial loss if e.g. an underestimated demand leads to missed sales [2, 13] . A common but computationally exhaustive approach to handle this problem is to periodically retrain a prediction model during the productive operation [13] . Furthermore, several methods combine change point detection (CPD), i.e. the problem of identifying a change of the generative data distribution, and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Some of them work offline and are therefore not suitable for changing data distributions during the online phase [9, 16] . Existing online approaches are either not event-triggered [21, 22] , require a certain number of samples of a new generative distribution [12] or are based on a priori assumptions in terms of potentially changing time series properties [17] . Furthermore, none of them apply data augmentation (DA) on samples prior to a detected change point to reuse these augmented samples for model retraining.\n",
            " In this work, we present EVent-triggered Augmented Refitting of Gaussian Process Regression for Seasonal Data (EVARS-GPR), for which we provide an overview in Fig. 1 . This novel online algorithm combines change point monitoring with a refitting of the prediction model using data augmentation. Compared to existing approaches, the main focus of our algorithm is on seasonal data with sudden changes of the target variable scale while values of explanatory features remain approximately equal, which is a common issue in seasonal time series forecasting. The data augmentation step is triggered after the detection of a change point and a deviation of the target variable scale compared to a certain threshold. This step updates known samples prior to a change point with new information on the changed target variable scale. Consequently, we gain potential useful data for the refitting of the prediction model. Hence, EVARS-GPR is event-triggered and as a result more efficient than a periodical refitting strategy. Furthermore, the algorithm reacts immediately after a detected change point and a priori assumptions on the output scale changes are not required. As prediction model we use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), see Appendix 1 for an overview. GPR is a flexible and non-parametric Bayesian method including uncertainties of a prediction value, which seems profitable with regard to the practical use of forecasts. Moreover, we evaluate the integration of different approaches for online CPD and DA, two essential parts of EVARS-GPR. We further analyze EVARS-GPR using simulated data and evaluate the performance on real-world datasets including different comparison partners.\n",
            " The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the related work. Afterwards, we provide the problem formulation in section 3. Then, we outline EVARS-GPR in section 4 followed by the experimental setup in section 5. The experimental results are shown and discussed in section 6, before we draw conclusions. The initial prediction model is trained offline. During the online phase, the prediction of the next target value is followed by a change point detection. If a change point is detected, the output scaling factor, which sets the target values of the current season in relation to previous seasons, is calculated. If the deviation between the current and last output scaling factor exceeds a threshold, then an augmented refitting of the prediction model is triggered. In case one of the two conditions is not fulfilled, EVARS-GPR continues using the current prediction model.\n",
            " Methods enabling GPR models to work with nonstationary data distributions can be divided into offline and online techniques. A common offline approach is to switch between kernel functions, e.g. by multiplication with sigmoid functions [9] . For some technical processes, multiple steady states can be determined. This enables the association of a corresponding model. For inference, the one associated with the current state is selected [16] . However, these approaches are limited to scenarios for which change points respectively steady states can be defined a priori. Furthermore, change points occurring abruptly at a single point can be treated as a hyperparameter of a nonstationary covariance function [11] . A further possibility of handling nonstationary data distributions is to augment the input using time-related functions. One option is the introduction of a forgetting factor, which leads to a lower influence of the information contained in older samples. Another common technique is to periodically update the hyperparameters of a GPR model using samples within a specified moving window [22] . A more elaborate approach is Moving-Window GPR (MWGPR). This method discards the oldest sample after a new one becomes available. Moreover, a dual preprocessing and dual updating strategy is performed. This introduces a recursive bias term, which depends on past model errors and is added to the model's prediction to get the final forecast value [21] . All these approaches have the drawback of losing potentially useful information from earlier samples even if the data distribution did not change [22] . GPnon-Bayesian clustering (GP-NBC) is focused on computational efficiency with the goal of making it suitable for resource-constrained environments, e.g. robotic platforms. Based on online-trained GP models, likelihood ratio tests are performed in order to determine whether a new candidate model or a previously stored one should be used in the further process. A disadvantage of GP-NBC is that a certain number of new samples needs to be available to enable the training of a new model. This may lead to a delayed reaction after a change point occurred [12] . The INstant TEmporal structure Learning (INTEL) algorithm was recently proposed. First, a template model is learned using offline data. Then, a set of candidate models with varying hyperparameters due to assumptions of potential changes during the productive operation is constructed based on the template model. For the final prediction, all models are combined using weights that correspond to the likelihood of a new observation given each model. In its current implementation, INTEL is limited to univariate data. Furthermore, possible changes happening during the online phase need to be assumed a priori [17] .\n",
            " We define a multivariate time series = { , } as a sequence of samples consisting of -dimensional explanatory variables called covariates ∈ ℝ and a corresponding target value ∈ ℝ at time step . The target value at time step t, , is drawn from a distribution ( | ), i.e. it is dependent on the covariates . In this work, we consider seasonal data, meaning data that follows a certain periodicity of length . We assume that periodicity is present for the target variable as well as for at least some of the covariates . Thus, the target variable at time step can be decomposed in a seasonal component and a residual summing up all other effects: = + . Based on its periodicity of length , the seasonal component at time step t is similar to those of previous seasons: ≈ − ⋅ with ∈ ℕ\\{0}. The covariates respectively a subset ⊆ of them can also be decomposed in a seasonal component , and a residual , into = , + , , with similar periodicity characteristics regarding , . The strength of the seasonal pattern, i.e. the influence of the seasonal component on the final value, might vary for different covariates and target variables.\n",
            " With samples of , a model , here a Gaussian Process Regression, can be trained offline using cross-validation to determine the hyperparameter configuration that delivers predictions ̂ generalizing best to the true distribution ( | ). During the online phase, with a new input provided at every time step , the model is used to deliver a prediction for the target variable value ̂ based on . However, it is a common issue in time series forecasting that the generative distribution ( | ) our predictor was trained on might change to another distribution ( | ). The time step at which such a shift happens is called a change point. In this work, we focus on output scale shifts, meaning that the value range of the target variable changes. Therefore, with regard to the periodicity of the covariates and the target variable y, a similar covariate vector corresponds to a different target variable as the generative distribution changed. Consequently, the predictions produced by the previously trained model might not be useful anymore. With EVARS-GPR, we address this problem by combining online change point monitoring of the target variable and a refitting of the base model using data augmentation in case a change point is detected. A list of symbols including those of subsequent sections is provided in Appendix 2.\n",
            " EVARS-GPR is an online algorithm that is focused on changes resulting in an output scale shift of seasonal multivariate time series, as outlined in section 3. In Fig. 1 and Algorithm 1, we give an overview of EVARS-GPR. Following the problem formulation, we assume an offline-trained model , which we subsequently call the base model . Prior to the online phase, the current prediction model is initialized with this offline-trained model . As EVARS-GPR operates online, the main part starts with a new sample becoming available at time step . As a first step, we retrieve the prediction of the next target value ̂ using the covariates as well as the current model . Then, we run an online change point detection (CPD) algorithm, which is updated with the current target variable value . In case we do not detect a shift of the generative distribution ( | ), the current prediction model stays unchanged and the algorithm waits for the next time step + 1. However, if we determine a change point at time step , the remaining procedures of EVARS-GPR are triggered. First, as EVARS-GPR is focused on changes of the output scale in seasonal time series data, the output scaling factor is determined. For that purpose, the target values prior to the change point and within a window of size are considered. These are set in relation to the target values within the corresponding window of previous seasons with a season length of :\n",
            " The nominator of Eq. (1) includes current target values prior to the change point, whereas the denominator conveys information on the corresponding period of a previous season. This ratio is averaged over the number of seasons taken into account to retrieve the output scaling factor. Online CPD is prone to false alarms due to outliers. For this reason and to limit the amount of refittings for efficiency, we set a minimum threshold for the deviation between the current output scaling factor and the output scaling factor of the last augmented refitting . If this threshold is exceeded, the augmented refitting of the current model is triggered. First, we generate an augmented set of samples ′ based on the dataset prior to the change point at time step . Thereby, we reuse known samples and update them with new information on the changed target variable scale. Consequently, we gain an augmented dataset ′ for the refitting of the current model . Furthermore, the last output scaling factor is stored. Subsequently, the refitted current model is used for the predictions of the target value. With a new sample arriving at the next time step + 1, the whole cycle of predicting, change point monitoring, potential data augmentation and model refitting starts again.\n",
            " The goal of CPD is to find abrupt changes in data, in the context of this work resulting in a shift of the scale of the target variable . A CPD method should ensure a quick reaction to a change point. Considering a real time operation, computationally efficient CPD methods are advantageous. Beyond that, for EVARS-GPR, the CPD and the prediction methods are separated in order to enable the output scale-dependent, augmented model refitting. For these reasons, we excluded approaches such as GPTS-CP [24] and BOCPD-MS [15] . Based on the outlined criteria, we evaluated Bayesian Online Change Point Detection (BOCPD) and ChangeFinder (CF). More information on these two methods can be found in Appendix 3. In both cases, we deseasonalize data via seasonal differencing in order to prevent false alarms due to seasonal effects [2] .\n",
            " Besides online CPD, DA is an essential part of EVARS-GPR. For this work, we focus on computationally efficient approaches ensuring a real time operation and consider small datasets as well. Therefore, we excluded generative models such as Time-GAN [28] or C-RNN-GAN [20] . First, we augmented the original dataset consisting of all samples prior to a change point at time step , 0: , by scaling the original target variable vector 0: . Thereby, we multiply the target variable vector 0: with the output scaling factor and leave the covariates 0: unchanged, resulting in the augmented dataset 0: . Considering the focus on shifts of the output scale, augmenting the dataset by scaling the target variable vector is a reasonable and efficient approach. Second, we used two virtual sample generation techniques for imbalanced regression: Random Oversampling with the introduction of Gaussian Noise (GN) [26] and SMOGN, which combines the former and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique for Regression (SMOTER) [5, 27] . Both methods are outlined in Appendix 4. Experimental Setup\n",
            " Subsequently, we will first describe the simulated data we used to determine the configuration of EVARS-GPR and to analyze its behavior. Afterwards, we outline the realworld datasets and the performance evaluation.\n",
            " EVARS-GPR is focused on seasonal data with changes regarding the target variable scale during the online phase. In order to configure and parametrize the algorithm as well as to analyze its behavior, we generated simulated data fulfilling these properties. Fig. 2 visualizes a simplified example of simulated data to explain its configuration. As we observe in Fig. 2a , the target variable follows a periodical pattern with a season length and an amplitude . Between and during the online phase, we manipulate by a multiplication with a factor , which results in a change of the output scale. The characteristics of this manipulation factor are visualized in Fig. 2b . At , we begin with and increase by a slope of at every time step , up to a maximum manipulation factor . Then, the manipulation factor stays constant until its sequential decrease is triggered in order to reach at . To meet the properties specified in section 3, the covariates are also periodical. Both and can be modified with additive random noise in order to model the seasonality more realistic. Between and , the base series with its amplitude is changed by multiplication with a manipulation factor . (b) Configuration of the manipulation factor . Starting from at , the manipulation factor increases by a slope at every time step . If a maximum manipulation factor is reached, stays constant. At , the base factor is reached again after sequentially decreasing using .\n",
            " In summary, the parameters , , , and enable us to simulate various settings of the output scale change. For instance, and modify the duration and time of occurrence. Furthermore, marks the maximum extent of the output scale change, whereas determines its increase at every time step , thus the speed respectively abruptness. Based on this, we formulated 67 scenarios and evaluated the performance to select the online CPD and DA method for EVARS-GPR, see section 6.1. Furthermore, the parametrization of EVARS-GPR is based on these scenarios, see Appendix 5 for an overview. For that purpose, we employed a random search with 100 different parameter settings for each combination of online CPD and DA method [3] . \n",
            " We additionally evaluated EVARS-GPR on real-world datasets. Based on the algorithm's scope, we selected seasonal time series data, for which we provide more information in Appendix 6. For the horticultural sales prediction dataset CashierData 1 , we observe a strong sales increase of potted plants (PotTotal) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020. Furthermore, we included the following common and publicly available datasets with changes of the output scale during the online phase: DrugSales [13] , VisitorNights [13] , AirPassengers [4] and MaunaLoa [10] . Beyond that, we used time series data without such changes to test the robustness of EVARS-GPR: Champagne-Sales [18] , TouristsIndia [7] , Milk [19] , Beer [13] and USDeaths [19] . We further applied mean imputation for missing values and added calendric as well as statistical features, e.g. lagged target variables, see Appendix 6 for an overview. Then, we used 80 % of the data to determine the base model , i.e. the configuration that leads to the best performance in a cross-validation setup. Thereby, we employed a random search over the model's hyperparameters such as the kernel function as well as preprocessing parameters, e.g. whether to perform a principal component analysis [3] . Finally, we evaluated EVARS-GPR in an online setting for the remaining left out 20 % of the data.\n",
            " To evaluate the performance on a set of samples, we used the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which is defined as = √1/n ∑ ( −̂) 2\n",
            " with the true value and the prediction ̂. As the RMSE is scale-dependent, we further applied a scaling by the RMSE value achieved with , subsequently called RMSE-ratio. Thus, the performances on simulated scenarios with different scales are comparable.\n",
            " We included several comparison partners for the real-world datasets. applies the offline-trained model during the whole online phase. Furthermore, we employed common but computationally exhaustive periodical refits of the prediction model, which trigger a retraining at every (PR1) respectively every second (PR2) time step [13] . Moving-Window GPR (MWGPR) is included as an additional computational resource demanding comparison partner, because a refit is needed at every time step [21] . Moreover, we defined methods with a computational resource consumption similar to EVARS-GPR. These methods also react after a valid change point was detected, so the number of refittings and thus the resource consumption is similar. CPD_scaled scales the predictions of using the output scaling factor , whereas CPD_retrain triggers a refitting of the current prediction model using all original samples prior to a change point. CPD_MW also leads to a refitting, but only uses data of the season before the detected change point. For an estimate of the resource consumption, we measured the process-wide CPU time of EVARS-GPR and the computationally exhaustive methods on a machine with two 2.1 GHz Intel Xeon Gold 6230R CPUs (each with 26 cores and 52 threads) and a total of 756 GB of memory.\n",
            " In this section, we will first describe the behavior on simulated data. Afterwards, we outline the results on real-world datasets, before we discuss them.\n",
            " We determined the configuration and parameters of EVARS-GPR based on simulated data. Using CF for online CPD and a scaling of the original dataset for DA lead to the lowest RMSE-ratio averaged over all scenarios (0.549). Thereby, we experienced that EVARS-GPR is sensitive to hyperparameters, e.g. the window size , see Appendix 5 regarding the final values. We further analyzed EVARS-GPR on different output scale changes regarding the extent (maximum manipulation factor ), speed (slope ), time of occurrence and duration (both via start respectively end index ). Results are visualized in Fig. 3 . The performance of EVARS-GPR was in all scenarios at least equal to and outperformed it in most of the cases. Fig. 3a and 3b show that the advantage of EVARS-GPR was larger for longer periods with an output change. However, there was also an improvement for shorter durations. EVARS-GPR was beneficial for several extents and speeds of the shift as well as robust for constant scenarios ( = 1), see Fig. 3c and 3d. For smaller slopes , the improvement tended to decrease with a higher maximum manipulation factor . We observe in Fig. 3d that EVARS-GPR's benefit was mostly smaller for maximum manipulation factors close to one. We included further scenarios in Appendix 7, which show similar results. \n",
            " We further evaluated EVARS-GPR on several real-world datasets. In Table 1 , we show the model performance in terms of RMSE compared to methods with a similar computational resource consumption for datasets with a changing target variable scale. As we observe, EVARS-GPR was superior on all datasets. Our algorithm outperformed with an improvement of 37.9 % averaged over all datasets and the second-best competing method among all datasets by 20.8 %. Beyond that, we compared EVARS-GPR to computationally exhaustive methods, for which we show the results as well as the process-wide CPU time in Table 2 . EVARS-GPR outperformed all other methods with respect to the CPU time. In comparison to PR2, the method with the second lowest runtimes, the runtime of EVARS-GPR averaged over all datasets was more than six times lower. It is not surprising that these comparison partners outperformed EVARS-GPR with respect to predictive power, however at the cost of computational runtime. Regarding AirPassengers and Mau-naLoa, for which EVARS-GPR was outperformed in terms of RMSE, the CPU time of EVARS-GPR was 16 respectively 250 times more efficient. However, for Cash-ierData, DrugSales and VisitorNights, the RMSE of EVARS-GPR was comparable to the leading ones, while being computationally much more efficient. In Table 3 , we see that EVARS-GPR was robust for datasets without an output scale change during the online phase as the results were identical to . \n",
            " We showed that EVARS-GPR is able to handle seasonal time series with changes of the target variable scale, both on simulated and real-world data. The performance on simulated data demonstrates a broad applicability regarding the time of occurrence, duration, speed and extent of the output scale change, with a higher advantage over for longer durations. Shorter changes are more difficult to detect for online CPD methods, which is one reason for the lower improvement in such settings. Our results further indicate that EVARS-GPR can handle various speeds and extents of the output scale change, which can be seen as different abruptness levels. This applies both for increases as well as decreases. Experiments with smaller extents showed smaller improvements of EVARS-GPR, as it is more difficult to detect such changes. A similar effect can be observed for smaller speeds and larger extents of the output scale change. Nevertheless, EVARS-GPR was at least on par with in all cases and outperformed it in most of the settings.\n",
            " In addition, EVARS-GPR outperformed all methods with a similar computational resource consumption with respect to RMSE on real-world datasets, with a mean improvement of 20.8 % compared to the second-best approaches. Regarding AirPassengers and MaunaLoa, the advantage of EVARS-GPR in terms of RMSE was 7.6 % respectively 10.4 %. For these datasets, the output scale changes at the detected change points were rather small. Consequently, the DA step did not enhance the performance that much, which might be a reason for the smaller improvements on RMSE in contrast to the other datasets. Furthermore, the difference to other periodical refitting strategies was largest for AirPassengers and MaunaLoa. This might indicate that not all possible change points were detected or that these datasets possess further data distribution shifts not resulting in an output scale change. With respect to the other three datasets, EVARS-GPR's results were comparable to the periodical refitting strategies, suggesting that all relevant change points could be detected. Moreover, we showed EVARS-GPR's efficiency in comparison with periodical refitting strategies with a more than six-fold reduction of the averaged runtime in relation to PR2. This advantage of EVARS-GPR was even bigger for AirPassengers and MaunaLoa with a 16 respectively 250 times lower runtime compared to the best performer. Finally, EVARS-GPR was robust for datasets without changes of the target variable scale.\n",
            " The online detection of change points is an essential part of EVARS-GPR, as wrong or missed detections might lead to a performance decrease. We addressed the problem of misdetections due to outliers with the introduction of a threshold for the output scaling factor. Nevertheless, EVARS-GPR would probably benefit a lot from improvements of the online CPD method. Moreover, we observed lower RMSE values for periodical refitting strategies, especially on a dataset with more samples (MaunaLoa). Thus, a combination of EVARS-GPR and a periodical refitting strategy with a lower frequency is an interesting approach for future research. This might result in a computationally efficient algorithm, which is additionally able to capture changing data distributions that do not result in a target variable scale. We further determined the parameters of the whole pipeline based on simulated data. This might not be the best strategy for all settings and real-world applications. However, as the simulated scenarios were diverse and reflected the scope of this work with output scale changes, this is a reasonable approach. Nevertheless, another way for parameter optimization is a further potential for future research. One possibility is to integrate this into the cross-validation performed offline by simulating different manipulations of the real-world data. Beyond that, EVARS-GPR is model-agnostic. Therefore, it seems interesting to transfer this approach to other prediction models, e.g. XGBoost, which is limited to prediction values within the target value range of the training set [8] .\n",
            " In this paper, we presented EVARS-GPR, a novel online time series forecasting algorithm that is able to handle sudden shifts in the target variable scale of seasonal data by combining change point monitoring with an augmented refitting of a prediction model. Online change point detection and data augmentation are essential components of EVARS-GPR, for which we evaluated different approaches based on simulated scenarios. Using the resulting configuration and parameterization, we showed on simulated data that EVARS-GPR is applicable for a wide range of output scale changes. Furthermore, EVARS-GPR had on average a 20.8 % lower RMSE on different real-world datasets compared to methods with a similar computational resource consumption. Moreover, we demonstrated its computational efficiency compared to periodical refitting strategies with a more than six-fold reduction of the averaged runtime.\n",
            " Conducting the same derivation as shown above results in a similar outcome:\n",
            " The need of inverting the matrix possibly causes computational problems if the dimension of the feature space becomes large. To solve this, we can reformulate the above using the so-called \"kernel trick\". This leads to the formulation of a Gaussian Process, which is completely specified by its mean and covariance function:\n",
            " ( , ′) consists of the covariance value between any two sample points and ′ resulting in a matrix for a training set length of . The assumption is that the similarity between samples reflects the strength of the correlation between their corresponding target values. Therefore, the function evaluation can be seen as a draw from a multivariate Gaussian distribution defined by ( ) and ( , ′). Thus, Gaussian Processes are a distribution over functions rather than parameters, in contrast to Bayesian linear regression. For simplicity, the mean function is often set to zero or a constant value. There are many forms of kernel functions, which need to fulfill certain properties, e.g. being positive semidefinite and symmetric. Furthermore, they can be combined, e.g. by summation or multiplication. The choice of the covariance kernel function is a determining configuration of GPR and its parameters need to be optimized during training [15, 17] . \n",

            "Body Text: Vigilância epidemiológica COVID-19 · Subindetificação · Subdeteção · Sensibilidade sistemas de vigilância epidemiológica A vigilância epidemiológica é uma parte fundamental da prática de saúde pública. Considerar e avaliar a sub-deteção de casos é relevante na maioria dos sistemas de vigilância, especialmente em pandemias de novas doenças com um amplo espectro de apresentações clínicas, porque pode influenciar os momentos e de decisões em políticas de saúde e a perceção de risco da população. Este artigo apresenta e discute evidência inicial sobre a sub-deteção do COVID-19 e os seus motivos, opções de vigilância e reflexões sobre sua importância para informar medidas de saúde pública. No caso do COVID-19, abordar e estimar sistematicamente a su-deteção de casos é essencial para adequar as medidas de saúde pública, e comunicar essas achados é de extrema importância para a formulação de políticas.\n",
            " Epidemic surveillance is a critical component of public health practice. It gives us pictures of reality, informs policy and decision making, gauges health service demand, and feeds forecasts and models.\n",
            " However, surveillance is never perfect and diseases that present with a high proportion of mild, pauci-symptomatic, or subclinical cases can be hard to detect in most indicator-based surveillance systems and become harder to contain [1] . Surveillance pyramids can take different formats and proportions of undetected cases (often mild or asymptomatic). The scientific community is making efforts to address uncertainty about where to draw the lines separating different clinical manifestations and between ascertained and unascertained cases.\n",
            " Covid-19 surveillance is challenging because mild and subclinical cases may not seek health services, cases are advised to avoid health care unless necessary, and testing capacity may be limited (Fig. 1 ).\n",
            " In the case of COVID-19, addressing and estimating under-ascertainment of cases is essential to tailor public health measures. Communicating these findings is of the utmost importance for evidence-based policy making and community engagement.\n",
            " In Europe in late February there was a fast rise in the number of confirmed cases in Italy, and the probability of importation of cases of COVID-19 may have been high in Europe until Italy stopped movement from Northern Italy and later from the rest of the country. The rapid rise and characteristics of confirmed cases in Northern Italy indicated an earlier important undetected community transmission, especially among mild cases. As such, it is possible that in late February many cases from Northern Italy (and possibly from other European areas) were exported all over Europe. These cases may have given rise to mostly undetected transmission chains that remained active in the next months, justifying early enhanced surveillance and control measures that were taken by different governments to buy time for preparedness.\n",
            " The generalized under-detection of imported cases has been confirmed in a study in Singapore, which estimated that the overall ability to detect imported cases was 38% (95% HPDI: 22-64%) of Singapore's capacity. In high-quality surveillance locations (based on the Global Health Security index) it was 40% (95% HPDI: 22-67%) [2] .\n",
            " In line with these findings, a report by Imperial College London estimated that 2/3 of Covid-19 cases exported from mainland China remained undetected worldwide (until February 17), resulting in several undetected transmission chains. They found countries in Europe had relatively low sensitivity for imported cases [3] . A relevant part of the fast growth in detected cases in Italy and other countries could be related to undetected transmission chains from early introduced cases and accumulated a large pool of infected cases.\n",
            " It is likely that a high proportion of imported cases all around Europe have not been found, and isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine could not be applied considering the WHO suspect case definition (as of February 27, 2020).\n",
            " Although many countries advised travellers returning from certain areas to report (call a health line or medical doctor) if they had symptoms, it is possible that people with mild symptoms may not have followed this advice. Consequently, many cases that might have followed from this would not be tested because they lacked a clear epidemiological link (Fig. 2) .\n",
            " In fact, several articles suggest a major under-ascertainment/under-reporting of total cases in different countries.\n",
            " One study modelled the real dimension of the epidemic in Italy from international case exportations and estimated a real size of 3,971 cases (95% CI: 2,907-5,297), compared to a case count of 1,128 on February 29, 2020, suggesting an under-ascertainment of 72% (61-79%) of cases. In sensitivity analyses, the range of variation was from 1,552 to 4,533 cases (implying the identification of 27-75% of cases) [4] .\n",
            " Publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, from January 11 to February 10, 2020, revealed a significant decline in the fatality rate with time. As testing becomes widespread, the detection of milder cases that would not seek health care in the early stages will result in a lower case fatality rate [5] .\n",
            " Another study used data from air travel and cases imported from Iran in other Middle Eastern countries and estimated that there were 16,533 (95% CI: 5,925-35,538) COVID-19 cases in Iran as of February 25, which meant only 0.6% of all cases had been reported [6] .\n",
            " Other models used reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference, and estimated that 86% of all infections were undocumented Port J Public Health DOI: 10.1159/000507587 (95% CI: 82-90%) prior to 23 January, 2020, travel restrictions and that undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases [7] .\n",
            " Adding to this we should consider specific surveillance system delays from infection and symptom onset to reporting. We should ask ourselves whether different choic-es at different timings would be made at an individual and policy level if we only looked to the confirmed cases. Modelled estimations of total infected and counts of suspect/possible cases that were not laboratory confirmed should be considered and communicated together with uncertainty in model assumptions (Fig. 3) . \n",
            " Some countries initiated earlier and wider testing than others [8] . Some started earlier to test admitted cases of bilateral pneumonia without other aetiology (allowing for earlier consideration of community transmission), and some tested contacts even if asymptomatic. Criteria for testing in earlier stages was variable and resulted in very different testing rates [8] . The different testing strategies and consequent different levels of under-ascertainment may account for some of the differences in the fatality rate found in different countries in Europe such as Italy and Germany (9 and 0.2%, respectively) [9] , though we should also consider the impact of overload of the health systems, characteristics of the specific surveillance system, and population demographics and behaviour. There are various options for surveillance to improve case detection or make estimations (Table 1) .\n",
            " Limited capacity for testing may play a role in testing strategies, forcing some countries to prioritize testing, but it makes discussion and research around under-ascertainment even more relevant in those contexts. Underascertainment in surveillance should make us consider an under-ascertained need for specific early measures (for example of social distancing) but also, in later stages, that a much larger part of the population could be immune and social distancing strategies could change, which also raises the importance of serologic surveys in those circumstances to confirm these estimates.\n",
            " One document of the European Centre of Disease Control (ECDC) [10] reports that \"the detection of CO-VID-19 cases and/or deaths outside of known chains of transmission is a strong signal that social distancing mea-sures should be considered.\" However, with restrictive testing strategies, these signals may be missed. The document states that \"the early, decisive, rapid, coordinated and comprehensive implementation of closures and quarantines is likely to be more effective in slowing the spread of the virus than a delayed implementation\" and that decisions \"will very rarely be purely evidence-based\" as social and political considerations will also need to be taken into account. Evidence is always incomplete, especially in new pandemics.\n",
            " There is evidence of the effectiveness of public health measures such as travel bans, movement restrictions, and social distancing. A study used a SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model to estimate epidemiological parameters before the implementation of measures in Wuhan. If these measures had been initiated 1, 2, or 3 weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66, 86, and 95%, respectively, together with a significant reduction in the number of affected areas [11] .\n",
            " Another study reports that the effective reproduction number in Wuhan fell from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) 1 week before the introduction of restrictions on January 23, 2020, to 1.55 (0.41-2.39) 1 week later and calculated that in sites with Wuhan-like transmission potential in early January, when there were only 4 cases introduced, there is more than a 50% chance of the infection settling in this population [12] .\n",
            " Other simulation [13] suggests that to control most outbreaks, for R0 (number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection) of 3-5, more than 70% of contacts had to be identified. In most scenarios, highly effective case identification and isolation of contacts could control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. However, importantly, the probability of control decreases with delays in the identification of cases and contacts, increased time from onset of symptoms to isolation, fewer cases identified, and increased transmission before symptoms. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker [14] describes variation in government responses and explores whether rising stringency of response affects the rate of infection. They calculate a stringency-risk ratio but warn that recorded cases partly depend on how much testing is done, which is likely to co-vary with the stringency of the government's response. Regular updated results will be available for anyone.\n",
            " A recent study by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team shows that in the UK and US context, suppression requires a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases, and household quarantine of their family members, that may need school and university closures and reports other strategies that may involve social distancing of those > 70 years old. However, the study predicts that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed and suggests that intermittent social distancing -triggered by trends in disease surveillance -may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily [15] . This strategy needs robust surveillance systems that allow for acceptable sensitivity to timely decide on interventions. We believe these triggers must consider evidence and debate around surveillance system sensitivity and under-ascertainment. As suggested by another Imperial College Report [16] , this would be relevant to produce early evidence when exiting the CO-VID-19 social distancing policy after achieving containment.\n",
            " Due to different surveillance systems, different measures at different timings, different levels of stringency [14] , and different demographic and social dynamics, the outcomes within Europe may be heterogeneous. Undetected introduction of imported cases and many mild undetected cases making up those transmission chains may warrant early measures. By looking at the death epidemic curves (likely less sensitive to variations in surveillance system sensitivity) of different countries we see differences that can be related to earlier detection and implementation of measures (Fig. 4) . Notably, South Korea has managed to keep new deaths by COVID-19 low despite being in a relatively advanced stage of the epidemic and is one of the countries with a higher testing rate [8] . An early study [17] estimated the transmission potential of COVID-19 in the country and suggested early sustained disease transmission in the region which contributed to the rapid early implementation of social distancing measures to contain the outbreak [14] . Considering uncertainty and under-ascertainment is critical for decision when 500 cases could possibly mean 5,000. Delay from exposure and infection to reporting must also be considered.\n",
            " There is at this stage high uncertainty about the behaviour of the disease in Europe, the effectiveness of measures in different contexts, and the timing for their implementation. Often, measures should be implemented early with imperfect scientific knowledge. On the other hand, estimated total infection numbers can be important to justify measures for public opinion, engage them in preventive action, and reinforce recommendations for those who are tested positive as well as to inform decisions on exiting social distancing policies.\n",
            " More robust models will be produced soon, but models make assumptions based on surveillance data and other sources with different levels of uncertainty. Under-ascertainment should be considered, and the best available information and data should be included and pursued by improving surveillance strategies to reduce or better estimate under-ascertainment. With more epidemiological evidence, namely greater certainty in relation to the proportion of asymptomatic infections and their risk of transmission, different surveillance system sensitivity, effective R in different contexts and effectiveness of containment measures and with the results of the First Few X Cases FFX investigation proposed by WHO [18] for COVID-19 models will better take into account underascertainment in different countries. Understanding the extent of transmission in different regions can help policy makers tailor their response. Acknowledging that \"we can't fight a pandemic blindfolded,\" on March 16, 2020, the WHO urged countries to test.\n",
            " Under-ascertainment may be of relevance for COV-ID-19 policy. There is uncertainty on this subject and in the studies mentioned in this article and presented reflections. However, it is the role of the scientific community in public health and epidemiology not only to communicate what is certain and based in robust established science, but also of what is uncertain, when it may be of relevance for decision making and can be further researched, discussed, and shared. As in most infectious disease surveillance, under-ascertainment can be a relevant piece of the puzzle for COVID-19 science, policy making, and public opinion and should be systematically addressed and communicated.\n",

            "Title: Assessing the Impact of Changes in Household Socioeconomic Status on the Health of Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review\n",
            "Body Text: Research in the past few decades has shown that children exposed to low-household SES face an increased risk of health problems and chronic conditions and worsened severity of health issues that develop (Condliffe and Link 2008) . The negative effects of low-SES on children's health can be identified before a child has reached school age, and these effects persist, and frequently worsen, as children grow older (Currie and Stabile 2003) . The accumulative and long-term effects of SES on child and adolescent health are therefore well established. What is less clear, however, is the relationship between changes in household SES and subsequent child and adolescent health. Much of the current literature on the influence of SES on child and adolescent health comes from research comparing children from low-SES backgrounds, whether cross-sectionally or longitudinally, with children from higher-SES backgrounds. This research has limitations, as children do not always remain in one income group throughout their lifetime. Furthermore, children from any SES background can be subjected to SES shocks that, while perhaps not changing the children's overall SES level, could have consequences for their health. For example, the 2008 economic crisis was associated globally with substantial harms to children's health, including increased infant mortality, worsening nutrition habits, increased violence against children, and growing inequalities in children and adolescent's health-related quality of life (Rajmil et al. 2014) . These findings illustrate the importance of understanding the ramifications of changes in SES, both long and short-term, on children's health. To further this understanding, this study offers the first review to synthesize and analyze the current literature on the impact of changes in SES on the health of children and adolescents over time.\n",
            " Knowledge of the mechanisms linking SES changes and child health is beneficial, from a public health perspective, for assessing and responding to the potential health effects of wide scale socioeconomic crises such as the 2008 Great Recession, which had a dramatic impact on the economic wellbeing of families (Reinhard et al. 2018) , or even the COVID-19 pandemic, which is projected to drastically increase global unemployment and poverty (Buheji et al. 2020 ). On a more meso scale, increased knowledge of the ramifications of socioeconomic changes on children's health could also help inform policy decisions in regard to factory closures, long known to be associated with increased morbidity among adults (Beale and Nethercott 1985) , and other local economic events. It is not just the negative effects of socioeconomic changes on children's health that are important, however. Greater knowledge of the impact of positive changes in SES on child health could be helpful in the design and assessment of interventions and policies aimed at increasing parental employment or decreasing child poverty (Kagura et al. 2016) . Beyond the public health implications, such information could also be useful, on a micro level, to aid health and social professionals in responding to the consequences of changes in family SES. As an example, in Norway enrollment in quality, regulated childcare centers was found to mitigate the effect of changes in SES on young children's behavioral problems (Zachrisson and Dearing 2015) . As Norway provides universal access to subsidized and regulated childcare, this finding supports health and social services encouraging enrollment in regulated childcare, especially among low-income families. It is evident that increased knowledge of the effect of SES changes on child and adolescent health could have myriad implications for the design and implementation of health policy and social services.\n",
            " The current study aims to provide a better understanding of the effect of changes in household, familial, or parental socioeconomic status on the health and wellbeing of children. The goal of this research is to synthesize the current body of knowledge on the impact of changes in income, employment, education, and other measures of socioeconomic mobility on the physical, mental, and overall health of children and adolescents. To date, there has been no prior systematic review on this subject, and thus this review will serve as an important reference point for ongoing and future research. This synthesis will identify current gaps in the literature as well as interesting findings that warrant further investigation and serve as a guide to subsequent studies on this topic. The consolidation of current knowledge on this subject should also be informative for the development of public health policy, at the macro and meso levels, aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of socioeconomic events on children.\n",
            " The complete protocol for this review is registered on PROS-PERO, ID CRD42020160653. Articles were retrieved from bibliographic database searches conducted on October 29, 2019, covering all indexed publications from the inception of the database to the date of the search. The databases used were MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Sociological Abstracts. These databases were selected as they provided coverage in the topic areas of health sciences, life sciences, and the social and behavioral sciences.\n",
            " To identify relevant literature pertaining to the research question, a search strategy was developed by a librarian with expertise in systematic reviews that included terms and headings reflecting four concepts: children, longitudinal study designs, family, and changes to socioeconomic status (see Online Resource 1 for complete search strategies). Terms related to health outcomes were not included in the search strategy, due to the breadth of possible outcomes. Studies with relevant health outcomes were identified during the screening process. Different combinations of search terms were tested to balance precision and sensitivity, before using the PRESS checklist to evaluate the research question translation, use of operators, selection of subject headings, and spelling (McGowan et al. 2016) . Additional articles were identified via screening of the reference sections of included articles and a search of gray literature, meaning literature not published in traditional academic databases, using Google and Google Scholar.\n",
            " To be included in this review studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) sample population included children and adolescents 18 years of age or younger; (2) study examined the effect of a change in parental, familial, or household SES; (3) study included at least one health outcome, defined broadly to include general health, anthropometric measurements, chronic mental and physical health conditions, cognition, psychological development, health behaviors, and any other physical or mental health outcomes; (4) data was longitudinal, not solely retrospective or cross-sectional, in nature, with at least two measurements of SES at different points in time; (5) analysis was quantitative or mixed-methods, not solely qualitative; (6) study was published in English or French. The inclusion criteria included no restrictions for year of publication or geographical region.\n",
            " If a study's sample included participants over the age of 18, the study was included and only the results for those participants 18 years of age or younger were extracted. In eight articles adolescents younger than 18 were not analyzed separately from those over age 18. In these cases, the studies were still included for their potential relevance to the research questions addressed by this review. The upper age range of the samples in these studies ranged from 19 to 22. Determining an exact chronological definition of adolescence is difficult as the meaning of adolescence has changed over time and varies substantially between different cultures and legal jurisdictions (Curtis 2015) . Current official definitions for adolescence in the U.S., for example, have an upper limit ranging from 19 to 25 years of age (Curtis 2015) . In all eight studies in question the samples were referred to as adolescents, although two studies also used the term young adults interchangeably. Although the focus of this review is on children and adolescents up to age 18, these studies were included as recognition of the impreciseness inherent in defining adolescence. A special note is made, however, when each study is first referenced in the \"Results\" section and the impact of their inclusion is assessed in the \"Discussion\" section. Articles that examined only subjective reports of socioeconomic status or financial wellbeing, such as the Mac Arthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (see Goodman et al. 2001) , were excluded, as this review is focused on the effect of changes in objective measures of household socioeconomic status, such as household income or parental employment status, on child and adolescent health outcomes. Although this review employs a broad definition of health, including cognitive and psychological outcomes, studies that exclusively examined child/adolescent educational outcomes (e.g. academic grades), deviant and criminal behaviors, or social supports were excluded.\n",
            " All studies identified by the database search (n = 3871) were first de-duplicated by a single author (RR) in EndNote using the validated Bramer Process (Bramer et al. 2016) , removing 1317 duplicates. The remaining entries were then uploaded into Covidence, where a further 284 duplicates were removed leaving 2270 unique entries. The title and abstract of these entries were screened for relevance by two authors (ARL, SM) with a third (SAB) settling disagreements. The same authors then screened the full text of all articles identified as potentially relevant during the title and abstract screen. A detailed description of the entries excluded at each step in the screening process, as well as the reasons for exclusion in the full-text screening, are displayed in Fig. 1 . All studies identified during the hand search of reference lists and gray literature search were also screened by the same two authors (ARL, SM) with the third author again settling disagreements (SAB). Before each screening step the authors practiced applying the screening criteria to a sample set of ten articles, and then met to discuss the screening results as a team to ensure there was common understanding of how to interpret and use the screening criteria at each stage in the review.\n",
            " Data was extracted from the final set of included studies (n = 80) by two authors (ARL, SM) with disputes again settled by the third author (SAB). The information extracted from each study included year of publication, geographic location of the study, study period, sample size, sampling method(s), respondent demographics, details on the analytic method(s), exposure of interest, outcome of interest, control variables, and the results of the study. When a study included exposures or outcomes that were not relevant to this systematic review only the relevant information was extracted.\n",
            " To properly capture the findings of each study, the unadjusted and adjusted results were extracted as well as the authors' written summaries of the results. A quantitative synthesis and comparison of these findings would be inappropriate due to the heterogeneity of the analytical methods included in this review, so instead the results are compared thematically based on the outcome examined.\n",
            " Article quality and risk of bias was assessed using The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies (Wells et al. 2014) , modified to fit the parameters of this review (see Online Resource 2). The NOS assigns each study a numerical score ranging from 0 to 9 based on sample selection, comparability, and the measurement of the outcome variables. For sample selection, studies are assigned one point for each of the following: a completely or partially representative sample, a non-exposed cohort drawn from the same community as the exposed cohort, ascertainment of exposure from administrative records or a structured interview, and taking methods to ensure that the sample did not have the outcome prior to the exposure. Articles were also assessed on the comparability of the exposed and nonexposed samples, based on the confounding variables controlled for in each study. One point was assigned if studies adjusted for three or more socioeconomic or demographic variables, such as respondent/parental age, respondent gender, household income, or parental education. A point was also given to studies that controlled for any child or familial health history variables that could confound the relationship between the socioeconomic exposure and the measured health outcome. Studies that controlled for child-level fixed effects were deemed to have met both criteria. In other words, comparability points were assigned to studies that attempted to promote comparability between the exposed and non-exposed samples, either through adjusting for common socioeconomic/demographic confounders or accounting for the influence of past health history. Finally, points were assigned to studies that used a reliable method to assess the health outcome, allowed for greater than a year of follow-up, and had adequate levels of follow-up or used proper methods to account for attrition.\n",
            " Figures 2, 3 and 4 summarize demographic information about the included articles, including year of publication, location of the study, and the age composition of participants at the time of the exposure and outcome. This information is also displayed individually for each article in Table 1 . Figure 2 illustrates that the majority of articles included in this review were published after 2009 (N = 60, 75.0%), and no articles published before 1991 were identified for inclusion. Figure 3 displays the geographical distribution of included papers grouped into clusters by continent. More than half of the articles (N = 44, 55.0%) examined populations in North America, all within Canada and the U.S. A further 20 articles (25.0%) examined European populations: 13 (16.3%) in the U.K. and Ireland, and the remaining seven (8.7%) in Nordic countries. 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 1992 1991 Frequency\n",
            " Year of PublicaƟon Figure 4 summarizes data on the age at exposure and outcome for the included studies. To facilitate interpretation, studies were grouped into categories based on the age of their sample at the start and end of measurement. For the purpose of this review, Infancy was defined as ages 0-2, Preschool as ages 3-5, Childhood as ages 6-11, and Adolescence as ages 12-18. If studies examined two different exposures, outcomes, or samples at different age groups, both age groups included. According to Fig. 4 , the majority of the exposures were assessed from infancy to a later age (N = 53, 65.4%), with 24 (29.6%) starting the measurement of the exposure in infancy (between age 0 and 2) and ending measurement in adolescence (between age 12 and 18). The outcome variables, on the other hand, were mostly measured within a single age group, with 31 outcome measurements (34.8%) occurring in adolescence, 16 occurring in childhood (18.0%), and 14 (15.7%) occurring in preschool. All of the exposures were assessed longitudinally, as a criterion for inclusion. As such, most exposures were measured across age groups whereas most of the outcomes were assessed in a single age group.\n",
            " Information on the gender and racial/ethnic composition of included studies are also displayed in Table 1 . Overall, 62 (77.5%) of the included articles reported information on the gender composition of their samples. Only one of these 62 articles included only female participants, and no articles included only male participants. In the remaining 61 papers, the proportion of the sample that was female ranged between 42.6 and 54.4%. In comparison, only 54 (67.5%) of included studies reported information on the racial/ethnic composition of their samples. Of these 54 papers, both of those examining South African populations restricted their samples to black participants and one paper examining a UK population restricted its sample to white participants. Table 1 display the distributions of sample sizes for the included studies. Two papers did not report a sample size. Overall, there was a wide distribution of sample sizes, with the smallest study reporting a sample size of only 237 respondents (James-Todd et al. 2010), and the largest having a sample of 534,294 respondents (Björkenstam et al. 2017 ). Nearly 21% of the studies reported a sample size smaller than 1000, and four studies reported a sample size > 20,000. Table 1 also displays information on the data source(s) used by each included article. Of particular note are the three countries where all of the studies utilized data covering only specific regions: five of the seven articles studying Brazilian populations used the Pelotas, Brazil Birth Cohort and the other two used data from a cohort in Cuiabá, Brazil; all four Canadian studies relied on data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD); and both In other words, the data sources used in all three countries sample only from specific regions, rather than at the national level, so the results may not be generalizable to the countries as a whole. Figure 6 displays the distribution of overall NOS scores for the included studies, and Table 2 displays the individual scores for each included article for each NOS category: Selection, Comparability, and Exposure. The mean NOS score for all included papers was 7.5 out of 9 overall, 3.6 out of 4 for Selection, 1.6 out of 2 for Comparability, and 2.4 out of 3 for Exposure. Of the 80 studies, 83.8% had an overall score of 7 or higher, and only one article scored a 3 (Hackenhaar et al. 2013) . The majority of the included studies received a perfect score in the Exposure category (n = 42, 52.5%), meaning they used a reliable method to assess the health outcome, allowed greater than a year for follow-up, and properly accounted for survey attrition. Among the remaining studies, the most common concern was a loss of > 10% of the original sample to follow-up without any methods used to account for attrition (n = 29, 36.3%). In terms of Comparability, only seven papers (8.8%) did not control for at least three SES confounders or for any confounders related to child or parent health history, 21 papers (26.3%) only controlled for one or the other, and the remaining 52 papers (65.0%) controlled for both.\n",
            " The Selection category had the highest relative mean, with no studies scoring a 0 or 1, out of 4, and only three studies scoring a 2. The overwhelming majority of the studies relied on a sample that was at least partially representative, drew the non-exposed cohort from the same sample as the exposed, and ascertained the exposure through a structured interview (n = 72, 90.0%). The most common obstacle, therefore, was failing to ensure that the sample did not have Those studies that received a full score in the Selection category (n = 48, 60.0%) often either started following participants before the health outcome could possibly manifest, controlled for the health outcome at baseline, or measured the continuous change in the health outcome over time (e.g. increase or decrease in BMI-z scores) rather than relying on dichotomous outcomes.\n",
            " The socioeconomic variables examined in the included articles were sorted intro five categories: Income (n = 64, 75.3%); Employment (n = 14, 16.5%); Socioeconomic Mobility (N = 3, 3.5%) meaning composite or general measures of socioeconomic status; Education (N = 2, 2.4%); and Food Insecurity (N = 2, 2.4%). These categories were not mutually exclusive, as studies that examined more than one type of socioeconomic exposure were included in both categories, leading to a total of 85 different socioeconomic exposures. Details on the socioeconomic exposures assessed in each article are displayed in Table 2 As noted, over three-quarters of the articles examined Income as an exposure variable. Of these articles, 28 assessed the effect of transitions into poverty/low-income or the association between long-term poverty/low-income trajectories and child/adolescent health. Twenty-three articles were interested in the impact of changes in overall household or parental income over time and seven were interested in changes in household income-to-needs ratios. Another two articles used a material asset-based definition of household income, and two looked at changes in the level of overall household financial difficulties. Finally, two U.S. based studies examined the effect of transitions on or off of welfare, and another U.S. study assessed the impact of increases to household's Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\n",
            " Of the 14 papers that looked at the effect of changes in employment on child health, six were focused only on changes in maternal employment, nine examined the effect of increased work or employment, two included transitions on or off of welfare as part of the employment measure, and all but one assessed the effect of parental job loss. In addition to those articles examining the effect of changes to employment, three articles examined changes in overall socioeconomic mobility: two assessed the effect of socioeconomic class, including employment, income, and education; one looked at the overall impact of changes in family economic circumstances due to the 2008 recession. Two studies examined the effect of a change in parental education, conceptualized as the completion of a new degree, an increase in the parent's years of education, or a return to school. The impact of transitions into or out of food insecurity over time on child BMI/weight was measured in two studies.\n",
            " To facilitate analysis, the health outcomes assessed in each study were grouped into eight discrete outcome categories, with several articles examining outcomes in more than one category: Anthropometric Measurements (n = 21), specifically weight and BMI; Cognition and Development (n = 15); Dental Health (n = 3); Health Behaviors (n = 9), such as smoking, alcohol/drug use, diet, and exercise; Mental Health (n = 12), including overall mental health assessments and psychiatric conditions; Overall Parent/Guardian Assessed health (n = 6); Physical Health Outcomes (n = 11), such as asthma and other chronic conditions; and Socio-Emotional Behavior (n = 30), predominantly referring to behaviors assessed with validated screening tools such as the Behavior Problems Index (BPI). Further details on the health outcomes examined in each article are displayed in Table 2 . In the following subsections the results are compared thematically based on these outcomes categories.\n",
            " Of the 21 papers that researched anthropometric measurements, 18 examined the effect of changes in household finances. Distinct geographical patterns emerged from the results of these articles. Among the three studies conducted in Quebec, Canada there was no evidence that household income changes had a unique effect on child/adolescent anthropometric measures not observed among all children exposed to low-income (Côté-Lussier et al. 2015; Kakinami et al. 2014b; Séguin et al. 2007 ). In comparison, two studies in the U.K. and three Brazilian studies showed mixed evidence, with only one study in each country displaying a unique effect of changing income on child/adolescent BMI (Hackenhaar et al. 2013; Hallal et al. 2012; Lai et al. 2019; McKenna et al. 2017; Muraro et al. 2016) . The results of the eight studies in the U.S. were also contradictory, although the majority (n = 6) found that either short or longterm decreases in household income were associated with increased subsequent BMI among children and adolescents, and similarly increases in household income were associated with lower subsequent BMI-z scores or weight statuses (Balistreri and Van Hook 2011; Demment et al. 2014; Jo 2018; Jones 2018; Kendzor et al. 2012; Margerison-Zilko and Cubbin 2013; Min et al. 2018; Oddo and Jones-Smith 2015) . The former relationship was also found in the one cohort study of Japanese children (Ueda et al. 2015) . Meanwhile, the sole South African study found that children whose households saw an increase in income between birth and adolescence were actually more likely to be overweight/obese in adolescence (Ginsburg et al. 2013 ).\n",
            " Three of the 21 studies evaluating anthropometric measurements assessed the impact of changes to parental employment. Two found that increasing maternal work hours or employment between infancy and childhood/adolescence was associated with increases in child/adolescent BMI (Ettinger et al. 2018; Jones 2018) , and one of the two also found paternal employment was associated with decreases in a child's BMI trajectory (Jones 2018) . Of the three studies, only one suggested that changes in maternal employment were not associated with overweight/obesity, although this study was restricted to adolescents (Martin et al. 2018) . All three studies were conducted in the U.S. Two U.S. studies evaluated the impact of transition into food insecurity on BMI-z and weight status. One found that becoming food insecure between kindergarten and grade three was associated with larger gains in BMI and weight among male children, but not female children (Jyoti et al. 2005) . In contrast, Demment (2013) found that any exposure to food insecurity between birth and age 15 was associated with higher BMI-z scores, compared to food secure children, but there was no long-term protective effect of moving out of food insecurity on BMI-z.\n",
            " One additional U.S. study assessed the relationship between changes in parental education and BMI. Jones (2018) , found that upward transitions in maternal education, when a child was between the ages of two and 18, were associated with linear growth in that child's BMI, that disappeared when controlling for maternal BMI. Meanwhile, upward transitions in paternal education were associated with a linear decrease in a child's BMI.\n",
            " A total of 15 studies examined the effect of changes in parental or household socioeconomic status on child or adolescent cognition and development. Eleven of the 15 studies examined changes in income: eight in U.S. populations and three in U.K. populations. For the remaining four papers, three analyzed changes in employment and one looked at changes in maternal education, all in the U.S.\n",
            " Among the 11 articles analyzing changes in income, five found that increased family income between infancy and preschool years (Breidenstine 2004; Dearing et al. 2001; Kiernan and Mensah 2009) , or childhood and adolescence (Raffington et al. 2018; NICHHDECCRN 2005) is associated with better cognitive outcomes in the subsequent years, particularly among children whose households were poor at baseline (Breidenstine 2004; Dearing et al. 2001; Raffington et al. 2018) . Six studies also provided evidence that long-term decreases in income (Hackman et al. 2015; Moore et al. 2002; Petterson and Albers 2001; NICHHDECCRN 2005) or short-term household income reductions (Holmes and Kiernan 2013; Yeung et al. 2002) between infancy and childhood are associated with worse subsequent cognitive outcomes. Only one study found that household income changes, specifically transient exposure to poverty between birth and 5 years of age, was not associated with subsequent cognitive functioning (Schoon et al. 2012) . In summary, 10 out of these 11 studies provided evidence that increasing income trajectories are associated with better overall cognition among children over time while decreasing income trajectories are associated with declines in overall cognition.\n",
            " Among the three studies examining changes in parental employment, two of the three found no association between changes in maternal employment and child cognition during preschool years (Chase-Lansdale et al. 2003; Im 2014) . However, one of these two also found that parental transitions from employment to welfare were subsequently associated with lower reading abilities in adolescence (Chase-Lansdale et al. 2003) . In contrast, Wightman (2010) provided evidence that parental job loss events between birth and 9 years of age were associated with lower reading cognition skills, while parental unemployment showed no significant effect on cognition between the ages of 10 and 15. This relationship between parental unemployment and cognition was mostly explained by changes in the home environment, and only somewhat explained by changes in household earning.\n",
            " One study examined the effect of gains in maternal education on child cognition/development and also found inconsistent results (Ross 2019) . Children between 3 and 9 years old whose mothers started with a high school diploma/GED and obtained a certificate or associate degree had higher receptive language scores at 9 years of age, but this relationship only held constant for married mothers and not for single mothers. Meanwhile, the attainment of a high school diploma/GED was only associated with a reduction in child receptive language skills among older mothers. No other differences in outcomes based on maternal age were uncovered. Thus, overall the evidence for the effect of changes in parental education on child/ adolescent cognition and development is inconclusive.\n",
            " Only three (2.8%) of the included articles examined the effects of changes in household SES on dental health. In two studies using the Pelotas, Brazil Birth Cohort, adolescents who transitioned into or out of poverty had overall worse dental health than persistently non-poor adolescents and better dental health than chronically poor adolescents (Peres et al. 2007 (Peres et al. , 2018 . The third study, based in Hong Kong, found that adolescents whose family income decreased between 12 and 15 years of age also experienced a worsening in their oral health, but there was no effect of increases in household income or changes in parental unemployment on adolescent's oral health (Yau et al. 2018) . Taken together, the three studies offer some limited evidence of a relationship between income changes and adolescent oral health.\n",
            " Among the nine articles that assessed the relationship between SES changes and child/adolescent health behaviors, three examined adolescent substance use: one in the U.S., one in Norway, and one in Brazil. Together, the three studies suggest that downward income mobility during childhood may be associated with increased alcohol (Poonawalla et al. 2014) , tobacco , or drug use (Skogen et al. 2019 ) in adolescence. The Nordic paper also found that adolescents who experienced upward mobility in childhood reported more tobacco and drug usage (Skogen et al. 2019) . In contrast, Hallal et al.'s (2012) study in Brazil found upward mobility to be associated with less tobacco. It should be noted however, that the Nordic study assessed tobacco and drug use at ages 16-19, so a portion of this sample fell outside the target age range of this review (Skogen et al. 2019 ).\n",
            " Three of the nine studies assessed the effect of changes in household income over time on children's nutritional behaviors. Results did not show a unique effect of upward or downward income mobility on child/adolescent nutrition in two of these articles, one in the U.K. (Skafida and Treanor 2014) and one in Quebec, Canada (Kakinami et al. 2014a) . By comparison, Min et al. (2018) found that children in the U.S. who were recurrently poor between 5 years of age and eighth grade had distinctively worse eating habits than children who were transiently poor or chronically poor. Together, these three studies reveal no generalizable relationship between changes in household income and changes in children's dietary behaviors.\n",
            " The four papers that assessed the relationship between SES changes and child/adolescent exercise behaviors, also revealed no generalizable patterns. In the U.S., adolescent sedentary behavior was found to increase among children exposed to recurrent poverty (Min et al. 2018) or maternal unemployment (Martin et al. 2018) . However, in a Brazilian study, upward income trajectories were associated with an increase in inactive transport use and downward trajectories were associated with the opposite ). Finally, in Côté-Lussier et al. (2015 study in Quebec, chronic poverty between 5 months and 13 years of age was associated with less physical activity while transitions in and out of poverty during those ages were not.\n",
            " Only one study, conducted in Norway, examined the relationship between household SES changes and adolescent sleep behaviors. Sivertsen et al. (2017) found that adolescents whose families moved into poverty between 8 and 17 years of age displayed overall worse sleep outcomes while chronically poor adolescents and those who moved out of poverty did not. However, like the other Nordic study this one also assessed the health behavior between the ages of 16 and 19, partially outside the target age range for this review.\n",
            " A total of 12 studies examined the relationship between changes in parental/household SES and child and adolescent mental health outcomes. Nine of these studies assessed the effect of changes in household or parental income, with varying results by geographic region. Two studies conducted in the U.S. demonstrated that improvements in household income between childhood and adolescence were associated with a decreased risk of mental health conditions in adolescence (Costello et al. 2003; Strohschein 2005) , and one of the two studies also found evidence for the inverse relationship (Strohschein 2005) . However, one of these articles assessed the mental health outcome between ages 13 and 21, partially outside the target age range for this review (Costello et al. 2003) . One study in the U.K. found a similar relationship to that observed in the U.S.; improvements in household income during adolescence were associated with a decreased risk of subsequent mental health problems (McKenna et al. 2017) . In contrast, the other three U.K. articles all found persistent poverty throughout childhood to be the most important predictor of mental health problems (Lai et al. 2019; Page et al. 2014; Russell et al. 2018) . Finally, among the three remaining papers, one South Korean (Choi et al. 2017) , one Swedish (Björkenstam et al. 2017) , and one Nordic , both decreasing and persistently low household income trajectories were associated with an increased subsequent risk of mental health problems among children and adolescents, although the Nordic study assessed the mental health outcomes between 16 and 19 years of age, partially outside the target age range for this review. Together, the results from the U.K., South Korea, Sweden, and Norway do not suggest decreasing household income has any unique effect on child/adolescent mental health not observed in those exposed to chronically low household income.\n",
            " This review also identified three articles evaluating the relationship between changes in parental employment and child and adolescent mental health outcomes. Chase- Lansdale et al. (2003) found that in the U.S. maternal transitions into employment were associated with decreased psychological distress and anxiety among adolescents, while transitions off welfare were associated with decreased drug and alcohol use. Similarly, in an Australian study maternal unemployment was associated with worse subsequent mental health among adolescents, particularly female adolescents, ages 15-20 (Bubonya et al. 2017) . In contrast, a Finnish study found that paternal unemployment events, but not maternal unemployment events, lead to an increase in the probability of purchasing psychotropic medications among adolescents ages 13-20 (Moustgaard et al. 2018) . Part of the sample population of both the Australian and Finnish paper, however, fell outside the target demographic for this systematic review.\n",
            " Six of the included articles examined the relationship between changes in household SES and parent/guardian assessed overall child and adolescent health: two in the U.S., two in Canada (Quebec), one in the U.K., and one in Ireland. In general, these studies found that any exposure to negative changes in household SES, including income loss, financial strain, and reductions in parental employment, were associated with worse subsequent parental assessed child health, and positive changes in household SES were associated with the opposite (Chatterji et al. 2013; Fuji 2012; McKenna et al. 2017; Reinhard et al. 2018; Séguin et al. 2007 ). The exception was one paper from Quebec that found children exposed to transient poverty between 5 and 41 months were not more likely to be rated as less healthy by their mothers than never poor children (Béatrice et al. 2012 ), however the other paper from Quebec found the exact opposite result among children in the exact same age range (Séguin et al. 2007 ).\n",
            " One of the articles explored the pathways through which changes in parental/household SES affect overall child health in more detail. In a U.S cohort of children 4-13 years old, Fuji (2012) found that an involuntary job loss by the household head was associated with a negative effect on child health for younger children. However, this relationship was not explained by the negative income growth following the job loss and decreases in income due to job loss were not more detrimental to child health than income losses from other sources. Conversely, negative income growth in the context of a parental disability event was associated with a more pronounced negative effect on the health of younger children than other household income losses.\n",
            " All 11 of the included articles that assessed physical health outcomes analyzed changes in income or overall socioeconomic mobility as the exposure. A significant relationship between changes in SES and a diverse set of child/adolescent physical health outcomes was found in seven of these 11 studies. Among a U.S. cohort of female children, James-Todd et al. (2010) found that downward socioeconomic mobility between birth and age seven was associated with a decline in the age at menarche. Similarly, two studies in the U.K. showed that children exposed to negative changes in household income experienced worse physical health overtime (Lai et al. 2019; McKenna et al. 2017) , particularly compared to children exposed to improvements in household income (Lai et al. 2019) . A relationship between SES changes and asthma was also found in two articles. The first, in Australia, demonstrated that increasing household income between birth to age 14 was associated with a decreased risk of asthma at age 14 for male children only (Kozyrskyj et al. 2010) . The second study, based on an Irish cohort, provided evidence that only reductions in welfare benefits, and no other negative changes in household employment or financial situation, between 9 months and 5 years of age were associated with an increased risk of reporting asthma and atopy symptoms at 5 years (Reinhard et al. 2018 ). Related to these two articles, Menezes et al. (2011) , found in a Brazilian cohort that income trajectory from birth to adolescence was associated with lung function, although this relationship was largely mediated through height, particularly for boys. Finally, Kagura et al.'s (2016) study in South Africa demonstrated that upward socioeconomic mobility between birth and 16 years was associated with lower systolic blood pressure, but no other measurements of blood pressure, at age 18 compared to chronically low SES profiles.\n",
            " Four of the 11 studies of physical health outcomes, however, did not find changes in income to be significantly associated with child/adolescent health outcomes. Two studies in Quebec found that only chronic income, and not transient income, between 5 and 41 months of age was associated with asthma and cumulative health problems (Béatrice et al. 2012; Séguin et al. 2007) , contradicting the results of Kozyrskyj et al. (2010) and Reinhard et al. (2018) . The results presented by Hallal et al. (2012) from the Pelotas, Brazil Birth Cohort also contradict the results of Kagura et al. (2016) , as they show no relationship between income trajectory and blood pressure. Finally, one U.S. study, by Chen et al. (2007) , found that lifetime income variability was not an important predictor of activity limitations or chronic health problems, and that children who moved into lowincome during childhood still had better health outcomes than chronically poor children.\n",
            " A total of 30 papers examined the effect of SES changes on children's and adolescents' socio-emotional behavior. Of these papers, 24 examined the impact of changes in household income, seven examined employment, and one examined education.\n",
            " The overwhelming majority of the articles that examined the effect of income changes were based on samples in the U.S. (n = 12) or the U.K. (n = 7). There were also two studies conducted in Norway, and one each in Brazil, Australia, and South Korea. Among these studies, 13 found a unique effect of changing income status on the socio-emotional behavior outcomes of children and adolescents. Nine articles reported that increases in income were associated with fewer subsequent behavioral problems, or, inversely, that decreases in income were associated with subsequent increases in children's behavioral problems (Dearing et al. 2001 (Dearing et al. , 2006 Lai et al. 2019; Lee et al. 2019; McMunn et al. 2012; Miller and Votruba-Drzal 2017; Strohschein 2005; Yeung et al. 2002; Wickham et al. 2017; Zachrisson and Dearing 2015) . In four of these studies, parental mental health, parenting practices, and/or childcare arrangements acted as important mediators in the relationship between household income changes and child behavioral outcomes (Lee et al. 2019; Wickham et al. 2017; Yeung et al. 2002; Zachrisson and Dearing 2015) . Two unique studies on welfare entry and exit also found that transitions from poverty to welfare between childhood and early adolescence were associated with worse behavioral outcomes, and transitions from welfare to poverty were associated with the inverse (Moore et al. 2002; Takeuchi et al. 1991) . Finally, one outlying study found that adolescents who moved into poverty had worse hyper and better peer scores on the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), compared to chronically poor children, while moving out of poverty was associated with the opposite. However, the sample for this study included adolescents from 16 to 19 years old, slightly outside the target age for this review .\n",
            " In contrast to the evidence of the previous 13 articles, 11 studies did not provide evidence for a unique effect of income changes on child and adolescent behavioral outcomes. In five of these studies, both chronic poverty and long or short-term transitions into poverty were associated with greater subsequent behavioral problems (Anselmi et al. 2012; Bor et al. 1997; Fitzsimons et al. 2017; NICHHDEC-CRN 2005; Kiernan and Mensah 2009) . Meanwhile five papers found that chronic or accumulated poverty, rather than transient poverty, was associated with increased behavioral problems over time (Eamon 1999 (Eamon , 2000 Mazza et al. 2017; McLeod and Shanahan 1996; Noonan et al. 2018 ). Finally, one study provided no evidence for any association between poverty exposure and subsequent behavioral problems (Holmes and Kiernan 2013) .\n",
            " Eight articles examined the effect of changes in parental employment on children's behavioral outcomes. One study found that any maternal transition in or out of employment was associated with more subsequent behavioral problems, with transitions into employment associated with more externalizing problems than transitions out of employment (Im 2014) . Similarly, Dearing et al. (2006) showed that increases in maternal employment were associated with increased externalizing problems, specifically for chronically poor children, although increases in partner employment hours were associated with decreased internalizing problems. Comparatively, in three studies, maternal transitions into employment were not associated with more behavioral problems or were associated with fewer subsequent problems (Chase-Lansdale et al. 2003; Hope et al. 2014; Zachrisson and Dearing 2015) . Three articles also reported that transitions into maternal and/or paternal unemployment were associated with an increased risk of developing socioemotional behavior problems in childhood (Chase-Lansdale et al. 2011; Hope et al. 2014; Wightman 2010) . However, the sample population of one of these studies, Chase-Lansdale et al. (2011), fell partially outside the target age of this review. Finally, one of the eight studies found no association between brief parental unemployment and subsequent behavioral outcomes (McMunn et al. 2012) .\n",
            " The one study that examined the effect of changes in maternal education on children's behavioral outcomes reported mixed results. The children of mothers who obtained a high school diploma/GED had lower internalizing behavior problems, but the attainment of a certificate/ associated degree was associated with an improvement in behavior only for children whose mothers were not married to the child's father (Ross 2019) . There were also no discernable patterns when results were stratified by income groups.\n",
            " Children and adolescents are acutely vulnerable to the influence of SES on health outcomes (Condliffe and Link 2008) . While the long-term effects of low-SES on children's health are well established (Currie and Stabile 2003) , less emphasis has been placed on understanding the impact of changes in SES on children's health. This review provides the first synthesis to date of literature examining the effects of changes in family, parental, or household SES on the physical, mental, and overall health of children and adolescents. Overall, there was no consistently observed pattern in the impact of changes in SES on each health outcome, and thus no broad conclusions can be made regarding a universal relationship between socioeconomic changes and child/adolescent health. Instead, the overall effect of the different socioeconomic variables (income/SES mobility, employment, food security, and education) on each health outcome are synthesized and compared below, and insights for further research and policy development are highlighted.\n",
            " Of the 81 studies included in this review, 64 (80%) examined the effect of changes in income on one or more of the eight possible categories of outcome. There were also three (3.8%) studies that examined the effect of overall socioeconomic mobility on child or adolescent health (Hackenhaar et al. 2013; James-Todd et al. 2010; Reinhard et al. 2018) . The results of the latter three followed similar patterns as the results from the studies of income, so the two exposures are discussed together. In four of the eight outcome categories, evidence from the included articles revealed a rather consistent pattern for the effect of changes in parental/household income on child/adolescent health: Cognition and Development, Dental Health, Overall Parent-Reported Health, and Physical Health Conditions.\n",
            " The research examining Cognition and Development, displayed consistent evidence that increasing household/parental income trajectories over time were associated with better overall cognition while the inverse was true for decreasing income trajectories (see e.g. Breidenstine 2004; Dearing et al. 2001; Kiernan and Mensah 2009; Moore et al. 2002; NICHHDECCRN 2005) . However, the effect of abrupt or transient changes in income was less conclusive, as two of the three papers found that abrupt negative changes in income had a corresponding negative effect on child/adolescent cognition and development (Holmes and Kiernan 2013; Yeung et al. 2002) , and one study did not (Schoon et al. 2012) . Taken together though, evidence from 10 of these 11 studies suggests that negative changes in income are consistently associated with worse subsequent child cognition, while positive changes are associated with improved cognition and development.\n",
            " Similar to the results for Cognition and Development, all three studies that evaluated the effect of income changes on Dental Health provided at least limited evidence that negative income changes in childhood are associated with worse subsequent adolescent oral health, or inversely that positive income changes were associated with ameliorated oral health (Peres et al. 2007 (Peres et al. , 2018 Yau et al. 2018 ). These preliminary results could have interesting implications for understanding public oral health trends, and more research on this topic is warranted to extrapolate on these findings. There should also be a concerted effort to assess the generalizability of these findings in geographically diverse samples, since the current three studies were restricted to Pelotas, Brazil and Hong Kong, China.\n",
            " There was also a clear pattern in the effect of changes in household income or general socioeconomic mobility on parent/guardian assessed overall child/adolescent health. Evidence from five of the six papers examining this relationship supports that exposure to negative changes in household SES are associated with subsequent reductions in children's overall parent-assessed health (Chatterji et al. 2013; Fuji 2012; McKenna et al. 2017; Reinhard et al. 2018; Séguin et al. 2007) .\n",
            " Comparably, the majority (n = 7) of the 11 studies on the effect of income/overall socioeconomic mobility on child/ adolescent physical health found that downward income/SES trajectories were associated with adverse subsequent physical health outcomes while upward trajectories were associated with the opposite (see, e.g. James-Todd et al. 2010; Kozyrskyj et al. 2010; Lai et al. 2019; McKenna et al. 2017 ). However, the remaining four studies found no evidence that downward socioeconomic mobility was linked to worsening physical health outcomes (Béatrice et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2007; Hallal et al. 2012; Séguin et al. 2007 ). Therefore, additional research is needed to support the strength of the relationship between income mobility and child/adolescent physical health. Furthermore, the 11 studies examined a diverse set of physical health outcomes, with some outcomes, such as age at menarche and blood pressure, assessed by only one or two studies, respectively. Expanding the corpus of research could help establish the effect of income changes on each individual health condition/outcome.\n",
            " In two of the outcome categories, Anthropometric Measurements and Mental Health Outcomes, the results were mixed with clearer patterns emerging when studies were stratified by geography. For Anthropometric Measurements, the effect of income changes varied substantially by geographical region. There was no evidence of a relationship between income changes and anthropometric outcomes in Quebec, Canada (Côté-Lussier et al. 2015; Kakinami et al. 2014b; Séguin et al. 2007) , mixed evidence in the U.K. (Lai et al. 2019; McKenna et al. 2017) , and mixed evidence in the U.S. with the majority of studies suggesting a significant relationship between changes in income and anthropometric outcomes (see, e.g., Demment et al. 2014; Jo 2018; Jones 2018; Kendzor et al. 2012) . Where a relationship existed in the aforementioned studies, negative changes in income were generally associated with increased subsequent BMI/ obesity, with the inverse also being true. In contrast, among the four studies based in the global south the evidence either showed no relationship (Hackenhaar et al. 2013; Muraro et al. 2016) or displayed the opposite relationship, with increased income associated with increasing BMI (Ginsburg et al. 2013; Hallal et al. 2012) . Thus, there is a substantial need for more research on this subject with a greater geographical distribution to draw consistent conclusions and uncover the socioeconomic conditions or policies underpinning these geographical differences.\n",
            " A similar geographic variation was found among the nine studies on the effect of changing income on mental health outcomes. The two studies in the U.S. suggested improvements in income during childhood were associated with decreased mental health issues and adolescence and decreases in household income were associated with the opposite (Costello et al. 2003; Strohschein 2005) . By contrast, persistent childhood poverty was found to be the most important predictor of adolescent mental health in three of four studies published in the U.K. (Lai et al. 2019; McKenna et al. 2017; Page et al. 2014; Russell et al. 2018 ). In the three remaining papers, based in South Korea, Sweden, and Norway, both decreasing income and persistently low income were associated with subsequent mental health issues (Björkenstam et al. 2017; Bøe et al. 2017; Choi et al. 2017) . Taken together, these studies suggest that decreases in household income do not have a unique effect on child/ adolescent mental health beyond the effect of general exposure to low-income. The exception may be in the U.S., and further studies should be conducted on this topic, both in the U.S. and abroad, to determine if this relationship is indeed uniquely observed in U.S. populations.\n",
            " In the remaining two categories, Health Behaviors and Socio-emotional Behavior, the results are simply inconclusive. For health behaviors, this inconclusiveness is due to distinctly different result patterns for each type of health behavior. For example, there was some evidence that downward income mobility during childhood may be associated with increased substance use in adolescence, although the particular substance that increased differed in all three geographically diverse samples Poonawalla et al. 2014; Skogen et al. 2019) . Meanwhile, there was no evidence of an effect of long-term income trajectories on nutritional or exercise behaviors (Kakinami et al. 2014a; Skafida and Treanor 2014) , although one study suggested that recurrent poverty, but not chronic or transient poverty, was associated with worse subsequent exercise and nutritional behaviors (Min et al. 2018) . Finally, one Nordic study found that transitioning into poverty was associated with worse subsequent sleep outcomes in adolescence . Overall, the current body of research suggests an interesting association between income changes and subsequent adolescent substance use, with possible regional variation, as well as subsequent sleep patterns, both of which should be expanded upon further in future research. The limited literature on the effect of income changes on nutrition and exercise behaviors do not support a consistent relationship, and should also be expanded upon, to strengthen the evidence base.\n",
            " The reviewed studies that assessed the effect of income changes on socio-emotional behavior also did not display a consistent relationship. Thirteen of the 24 articles in this category found that long-term or transient losses of income were associated with worse subsequent socio-emotional behavior, but nine studies found no unique effect of changes in income on child and adolescent behavioral outcomes (see e.g. Lai et al. 2019; Mazza et al. 2017; Miller and Votruba-Drzal 2017; Noonan et al. 2018; Yeung et al. 2002) . Thus, further research on this topic is needed to clarify the relationship between income changes and behavior.\n",
            " One possible area of further research could be to expand upon the finding that the effects of transitions into poverty may be more perceptible at later ages; specifically that persistent poverty between birth and childhood is the most important predictor of behavioral problems at age five, while transitions into poverty are more important at age 11 (Fitzsimons et al. 2017) . These results are based on evidence from a U.K cohort, so replicating the study in different countries could help determine if clearer patterns are elucidated at different ages. This area of research has the potential to reconcile some of the disagreement in the current literature, if the unique effect of income changes on child health outcomes, particularly behavioral outcomes, is found to be more perceptible at later ages.\n",
            " An alternative method for reconciling contradictory results in the current literature is to change the way poverty exposures are conceptualized. For example, two studies found unique results when chronic poverty was used as the reference category to assess the effect of income changes, as opposed to the typical reference category of consistently non-poor Eamon 2000) . Therefore, the unique effects of changes in income on health outcomes may be better elucidated when income is operationalized in a way that compares positive income changes to chronic poverty. Similarly, two studies of cognition and socio-emotional behaviors found that the positive effects of increases in household income were accentuated among chronically poor children and diminished, or absent, among non-poor children (Breidenstine 2004; Dearing et al. 2001) . Effectively, these papers uncovered a more nuanced relationship between changing income and child health by assessing the effect of income changes among chronically poor and non-poor children separately. The typical operationalization of income in this review compared children in several income trajectories, usually chronic poor, transition into poverty, transition out of poverty, or transient poverty, to chronically non-poor children. Future research could expand off of these four studies to re-operationalize income in a way that elucidates a more nuanced relationship between changes in household income and child health.\n",
            " Another useful pathway for future research could be to build upon the finding that negative income growth due to job loss did not have a more negative effect on children's overall health than income loss due to other sources, while the effects of income due to parental disability on child health were more pronounced (Fuji 2012) . This was the only study identified that explicitly compared the effects of different sources of income loss, but the results bear replicating in different populations and with different health outcomes as they could have clear public health and policy implications.\n",
            " There were also several studies included in this review that found parental mental health, parenting practices, and/or childcare arrangements to be important mediators of the relationship between income changes and child cognition and behavioral outcomes (see e.g., Holmes and Kiernan 2013; Lee et al. 2019; NICHHDECCRN 2005; Yeung et al. 2002; Zachrisson and Dearing 2015) . These results should also be replicated and expanded to other geographical populations and different health outcomes, as they could potentially offer a valuable key to understanding the mechanisms linking income changes to child health outcomes. This knowledge could in turn inform policy approaches aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of changing income on children's health.\n",
            " Fourteen of the included studies assessed the effect of changes in parental employment on the health of children or adolescents. Of these 14 studies, three (21.4%) examined anthropometric measurements, two (14.3%) examined cognition or development, one (7.1%) examined health behaviors, one (7.1%) examined dental health, three (21.4.0%) examined mental health outcomes, and eight (57.1%) examined behavioral outcomes. The unique aspect of parental employment, as an exposure, is that two prevalent and contradictory mechanisms are proposed to explain how parental employment affects children's health. The first mechanism follows the direction observed in most studies of income, with unemployment viewed as a negative shock to a household, in terms of resources and health, and therefore increased employment serves as a net benefit to a house (see e.g. Bubonya et al. 2017; Moustgaard et al. 2018) . In contrast, there is also the theory that increased maternal employment reduces the quality of childcare and maternal-child interactions, leading to worsened subsequent child health (see e.g. Ettinger et al. 2018; Im 2014) .\n",
            " Results from the three studies assessing mental health outcomes and the one study assessing adolescent sedentary health behaviors support the first mechanism. There is a generally consistent pattern in these papers that parental transitions into employment are associated with decreased mental health issues and improved health behaviors while transitions into unemployment are associated with the inverse (Bubonya et al. 2017; Chase-Lansdale et al. 2003; Martin et al. 2018; Moustgaard et al. 2018 ). However, there was variation between these studies in which parent's employment, mother's or father's, was significantly associated with child/adolescent mental health.\n",
            " In the remaining four outcome categories, anthropometric measurements, socio-emotional behavior, dental health, and cognition/development, the relationship between employment transitions and child health is less clear. The limited evidence from the three studies evaluating the effect of parental employment on anthropometric measurements seems to suggest that increased maternal employment is associated with subsequent increases in BMI, supporting the second mechanism, while increased paternal employment is associated with decreases in BMI (Ettinger et al. 2018; Jones 2018; Martin et al. 2018) . Similarly, two studies on children's socio-emotional behavior found that increased maternal employment was associated with subsequent behavioral problems (Im 2014; Dearing et al. 2006) . However, four studies also found no relationship or the opposite relationship between increased maternal employment and child behavior (Chase-Lansdale et al. 2003 Hope et al. 2014; Zachrisson and Dearing 2015) . Furthermore, two studies of general parental employment, not separated by gender, found unemployment events to be associated with increased child/adolescent behavioral problems (Hope et al. 2014; Wightman 2010) , although another similar study did not find this relationship (McMunn et al. 2012) . Yau et al. (2018) also found no relationship between changes in parental employment and adolescent's oral health. Finally, in the Cognition and Development category, two studies found no effect of parental employment (Chase-Lansdale et al. 2003; Im 2014) , while one study found that the negative effect of a parental job loss on subsequent cognition changed and decreased as children aged (Wightman 2010) .\n",
            " Overall, the body of literature on the effect of changing employment on subsequent child/adolescent health is inconclusive, specifically in regard to the effects of increased maternal employment on child/adolescent health. There is a definite need for further research on this topic to better clarify the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between parental employment changes and child health, especially given that only 13 (16.25%) of the 80 studies included in this review examined employment as an exposure. One useful area for further research would be to replicate the finding that the effect of unemployment on child health outcomes changes over time (Wightman 2010) . This approach could help reconcile some of the current disagreements in the literature, as most of the included studies focused on a particular, narrow age group (see Table 1 ). It should also be noted that while the mechanism underlying the relationship between parental employment, particularly maternal employment, and child health is still unclear, eight of the 12 studies found some evidence that decreases in parental employment had a negative effect on various child health outcomes. This evidence underscores the importance, from both a research and a policy perspective, of paying attention to the potential detrimental effects of unemployment events on the children of the unemployed (Bubonya et al. 2017 ).\n",
            " Changes in parental education and household food security were each only examined as exposures in two papers included in this review. The absence of studies assessing these exposures makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about how they relate to child and adolescent health. Both of the studies that examined the effect of changes in household food security were interested in anthropometric outcomes. The results of these two studies are inconclusive as one found the protective effect of becoming food secure disappears after infancy (Demment 2013) , while the other found that becoming food insecure was associated with a larger subsequent weight gain among children compared to becoming food secure, but did not compare food insecurity to persistent food security (Jyoti et al. 2005) . One of the studies on parental education also assessed BMI as an outcome and found that increased maternal education was not associated with subsequent weight gain while gains in paternal education were associated with decreases in weight (Jones 2018) . Meanwhile the other study on education found a very complex and inconsistent pattern between different educational attainments and subsequent changes in children's behavior and cognition (Ross 2019) .\n",
            " There were also three papers included in this review that examined composite measures of socioeconomic mobility as the exposure (Hackenhaar et al. 2013; James-Todd et al. 2010; Reinhard et al. 2018) . The results of these three studies were discussed with the results of income, but it bears mentioning that this was another category of exposure that has been under-studied in the literature.\n",
            " The current review includes interesting, while inconclusive, results that link changes in all three of these socioeconomic exposures, food security, education, and socioeconomic mobility, to child and adolescent health outcomes. All measures of socioeconomic status have important limitations. For example, measures of current income do not account for important assets or access to health/social services, and many are not adjusted to geographical variations in the availability, quality, and price of goods and services (Shavers 2007) . The overrepresentation of studies using income as the socioeconomic exposure in this review is a definite limitation in the current understanding of the effect of changes in SES on child health. Future research on this topic should therefore seek to move beyond income and explore the effect of changes in other measures of SES, including employment, education, and composite or assetbased measures.\n",
            " Defining adolescence is difficult as conceptions of adolescence have evolved over time and change depending on the physiological, cultural, or legal framework that underpins them. In this review, the target sample was children or adolescents 18 years of age or younger, as 18 coincides with the age of majority in many jurisdictions as well as the conclusion of secondary education (Curtis 2015) . However, 8 studies were identified that included adolescents over 18 years of age and did not separate these older adolescents from respondents 18 years of age or younger. The decision was made to include these eight studies due to imprecision inherent in defining adolescence as well as concerns that excluding them could also entail removing findings that pertained to adolescents under age 18. However, it is worth examining what influence the inclusion of these eight articles had on the results.\n",
            " Five of the eight articles examined the relationship between changes in income and subsequent child/adolescent health outcomes. Among those five studies, two provided evidence of a significant relationship between changes in income and the subsequent health behaviors of adolescents Skogen et al. 2019 ). Exclusion of either article from the review would not significantly alter the overall conclusion that the evidence linking income changes to health behaviors is inconclusive, as inconsistent results were observed for each category of health behavior and these two studies each evaluated a different type of health behavior. Similarly, Chatterji et al. (2013) was one of five articles that found decreased income to be associated with subsequent decreased overall health in children and adolescents, a relationship that was opposed by only one study. Exclusion of Chatterji et al. (2013) would therefore not impact the overall pattern that was observed between income and overall health. In contrast, Costello et al. (2003) was one of only two studies in the U.S. to show a unique effect of changing income on mental health outcomes, so removing this study due the inclusion of respondents over age 18 would weaken the suggested geographic pattern. Overall though, the majority of studies that evaluated the relationship between income changes and mental health did not find evidence of a unique relationship between the two, including Bøe et al. (2017) , which also included respondents over age 18. Inclusion of these latter two studies, therefore, did not impact the overall conclusion that more evidence would be needed to establish and clarify regional patterns in the relationship between income changes and subsequent child/adolescent mental health outcomes. In summary, removal of the five articles that assessed the relationship between income changes and child health would not change the overall patterns observed in this review.\n",
            " Three of the eight articles that included respondents over 18 years of age examined the impact of changes in employment on child/adolescent health. Chase-Lansdale et al. (2011) was one of four studies that did not find increased maternal employment to be associated with subsequent increased behavioral problems, so the individual inclusion of this study did not significantly alter the conclusions of this review. Meanwhile, Bubonya et al. (2017) and Moustgaard et al. (2018) were two of only three studies that suggested parental unemployment events have a negative impact on subsequent child/adolescent mental health outcomes. Exclusion of these latter two studies would significantly reduce the evidence supporting the negative relationship between parental unemployment events on child/adolescent mental health, although no studies were identified that refuted this relationship. If all three studies were removed, there would remain five studies that found decreases in parental employment to be associated with negative changes in child/adolescent health and four studies that did not, lessoning the consensus on the relationship between parental employment changes and child health outcomes.\n",
            " In addition to the overrepresentation of income as an exposure, an additional limitation of the research included in this review is the distinct overrepresentation of North American and European studies (N = 64, 80%), particularly U.S. studies (N = 38, 47.5%). There were often few, if any, articles from outside North America and Europe that investigated trends observed in those two continents, limiting the generalizability of certain patterns in the literature. In contrast, there were also examples where some health outcomes were only examined outside of North America, such as dental health, which again limits generalizability. Research in certain countries was also limited to specific geographical areas, such as the six Canadian studies included in this review, which all came from Quebec. The results in this review, and the information summarized in Table 1 , should facilitate the identification of geographical weaknesses in the current literature, and future research should try to replicate existing studies in new, more diverse geographies.\n",
            " It was beyond the scope of this review to conduct a thorough vetting and evaluation of article methods, as the principal goal of this project was to provide the first ever review summarizing and synthesizing the state of the literature on the effect of changes in household SES on child and adolescent health. However, a brief evaluation of bias using the NOS was performed, and detailed results of this evaluation are displayed in Table 2 . Overall, the papers included in this review displayed a low-level of bias, with 83.8% of the 80 studies scoring a 7 or higher, out of 9, on the NOS scale. The lowest score, three, was found in only one study (Hackenhaar et al. 2013) . Based on the bias analysis, the three most significant areas for improvement were using reliable methods to account for survey attrition, controlling for both SES and health confounding variables, and ensuring that the sample did not have the health outcome prior to exposure.\n",
            " Finally, in terms of the limitations of this review, the most significant is the possibility that publication bias influenced the observed results and patterns. The impact of publication bias on systematic reviews varies significantly between research fields. For example, a recent review found evidence of only mild publication bias in the fields of psychology and medicine, while another found that strong results in the social sciences were significantly more likely to be written up and published than weak results (Franco et al. 2014; Van Aert et al. 2019) . Given the heterogeneous nature of this systematic review, which straddles multiple research fields, it was not possible to perform the types of bias-adjustment analyses that are used in meta-analyses. Therefore, the impact of publication bias on the results of this review are unknown. This limitation was likely somewhat mitigated, however, by a comprehensive search of gray literature, which includes searching for reports and findings not published in academic journals, as well as the inclusion of dissertations that were not subsequently published in academic journals. Another limitation relates to the search terms used in this review. Firstly, it is possible that the search terms used were more biased towards income and employment than to other socioeconomic exposures, as these two socioeconomic exposures were specifically referenced in the search terms. Secondly, the concept of \"change\" was also difficult to capture in the search terms; studies often examined socioeconomic transitions alongside more stable socioeconomic trajectories and so the analysis of a change in socioeconomic status was not always clear from the abstract and title. These limitations were partially accounted for, however, by the thorough search of gray literature and a hand search of included reference lists. Search terms related to health were also explicitly not included in the search strategy to ensure that the results were not biased in terms of outcomes.\n",
            " Understanding the unique impact of changes in SES on child and adolescent health, as compared to the impact of chronic exposure to a specific socioeconomic level, has important policy and research implications. To synthesize the current literature on this topic, this article systematically reviewed the effect of changes in household or parental SES on the physical, mental, and overall health of children and adolescents. The results of this review demonstrated consistent patterns in the effect of changes in household income on child and adolescent cognitive/developmental outcomes, dental health, physical health, and overall guardian-assessed health. This review also found contrasting results on the relationship between changes in parental employment status and child/ adolescent health outcomes; although several studies found that decreases in paternal or combined parental employment were associated with worsened subsequent child health outcomes, other studies found the inverse relationship when examining maternal employment. Measures of income and employment made up the vast majority of exposures studied in this review, suggesting the need for future research to explore and compare more diverse types of socioeconomic exposures. Given that every measure of socioeconomic status has limitations, it is important that future research into the effect of SES changes on child and adolescent health examines a larger variety of socioeconomic variables. Overall, though, the literature in this review provides at least partial evidence of a relationship between changing household SES and each category of child and adolescent health outcomes, and in several cases the evidence supported strong relationships between the two. To strengthen the current literature and resolve inconsistencies, researchers should seek to explore a wider variety of socioeconomic exposures, replicate current geographically isolated results in diverse geographies, and explore the pathways linking changes in SES to child and adolescent health.\n",

            "Title: A Multidisciplinary Approach for Multi-risk Analysis and Monitoring of Influence of SODs and RODs on Historic Centres: The ResCUDE Project\n",
            "Body Text: In recent decades, the increasing anthropization has considerably amplified the negative impact of critical events, both natural (earthquakes, landslide, subsidence) and/or triggered by anthropogenic causes (panic in crowded places, terrorist attacks) on the safety of the Built Environment (BE), consisting of a network of street, buildings, infrastructures, open spaces and its users.\n",
            " Over the long-term period the BE is also influenced by very slow phenomena, such as the climate change, which have a direct impact on the climate of the cities, pollution and rainfall levels, energy consumption and aging of buildings. Such critical events, of geomatics and resilient urban methodologies, land-use and managing techniques and an agent-based approach.\n",
            " The project, whose description and its progress are hereafter presented, will develop over three years (from October 2019 to October 2022) and will be jointly developed by the Geomatics, Building Technologies and Urban Planning Groups.\n",
            " The ResCUDE project aims at addressing the needs for a better understanding of the effects of SOD and ROD on historic town centres. To this end, a multi-risk analysis is being applied to the historical BE, in order to the define its vulnerability and exposure to critical events (and the related damage), evaluate its levels of resilience and outline targeted mitigation actions.\n",
            " SODs and RODs have been usually analysed extensively in a separate way. At present, it is still necessary to deepen:\n",
            " • the mechanisms of potential interaction between RODs and SODs and the increase in magnitude of the latter; • interaction of people with the RODs;\n",
            " • the intrinsic resilience of the man-made environment towards the RODs;\n",
            " • the mitigation potential of the man-made environment against the negative effects caused by SODs.\n",
            " Current poor BE resilience usually depends on the fact that:\n",
            " risk mitigation/prevention strategies for RODs exclude the open spaces and human/user reactions, focusing just on the building; interactions between buildings and surrounding areas for risk reduction seem to be ignored, although they could lead to unpredictable critical safety conditions for open urban areas (i.e. uncontrolled car parking or inaccessible streets may make inaccessible the nearby open areas); risk increasing conditions such as crowding, and users' types are often ignored; causes and effects of ROD/SODs combination are usually neglected.\n",
            " Moreover, for SODs with a variable intensity over time (i.e. air pollution), risk reduction strategies marginally consider the potential of BE as a resilience-increasing element (i.e. typical strategies adopted to limit pollution are: vehicle stops, restriction of cars circulation, reduction of heating hours).\n",
            " The project wants to fill the previous gaps by fostering the integration between processes of knowledge, assessment, improvement and monitoring of BE in case of risks related to ROD/SOD. In this frame, geomatics data is being collected and/or generated on purpose, with the double aim of:\n",
            " 1. building a comprehensive 3D database of the BE, focusing on the historical centres, the acquired dataset will enable the opportunity of applying innovative approaches for:\n",
            " • Defining the performances of building aggregates to SOD, by collecting morpho-typological characters and technological features of buildings in historic districts from urban plans, usually expressed by classes of categories (e.g. building typologies, number of floors, constructive techniques, levels of conservations). These features constitute a Geographic Information System, used for the creation of main cataloguing maps in compounding the \"Historic District Plan\", and define a comprehensive model for assessing the potential level of resilience in response to climate change. • Adopting human response analyses in disasters by outlining spatial cognition and social behaviour in situations of panic and simulating evacuation and interventions in case of ROD. This methodology is based on the analysis of the behaviours in outdoor scenarios, as well as the influence on human choices of gender, age, health and other features, and focus on properties of the environment as activated, perceived and cognized by humans and on critical situations produced and driven by behavioural relationships between agents and with places, both of which tend to overlap in emergency situations [10] .\n",
            " 2. monitoring the structures over time, in order to identify potentially critical phenomena, as subsidence or landslides when present, and control they evolution and influence on the BE.\n",
            " The project is organized in three work packages, better described in the following paragraphs.\n",
            " The activities foreseen in WP1, coordinated by the Geomatics Group, are aimed at the extraction of multi-sensor and multi-scale 3D models, both through photogrammetric techniques and Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR). WP1 will be developed as follow:\n",
            " -Analysis of multi-sensor geo-spatial data for the extraction of high-precision Digital Surface Model (DSM) that will constitute the database on which three-dimensional simulations will run at predetermined time intervals. DSMs will be also deployed for delimiting areas subject to SOD and ROD in historical centres. -Exploitation of long-term Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) time series and other ancillary information (where available), as the geological setting of the investigated areas, to highlight subsidence and/or landslide phenomena [11] . -Development of algorithms for the processing of data acquired from satellite sensors operating in the thermal band, and hyperspectral data from airborne sensors and/or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems. This will allow the production of Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps to support analyses on surface urban heat islands.\n",
            " -Generation of 3D models at urban scale, which can be integrated with LST data, in order to better understand the intervention areas and supporting the mitigation actions of the effects of the investigated phenomena. -Implementation of a prototype WebGIS portal capable of providing detailed threedimensional information aimed at identifying the portion(s) of the building needing modifications/restoration and improve its performance.\n",
            " WP2 is coordinated by Building Technology Group. The activities focus on the relations between buildings in historic districts and the boundary environment in a longterm perspective in order to:\n",
            " -Define a comprehensive model aimed at the assessment of potential level of resilience in historic districts exposed to climate change (SOD). The knowledge of the historic building stock, as a combination of morpho-typological characters and technological solutions, represents the starting point of the analysis [12] . -Analyse and model technologies and materials for the mitigation of negative effects of SODs [13] , mainly related to the human wellbeing and the reduction of energy consumptions, solving the aesthetic normative constrain. Here, technologies and materials require a different scale of application: from the district scale to assess the outdoor comfort and the microclimate alteration, to the building scale to consider the comfort indoor and the energy needs (both as average and peak values).\n",
            " The effort allocated in WP3 will be carried out by the Urban Planning Group. In historic centres, RODs can lead to critical disaster conditions faster, undermining the host community's safety as well as resulting in time loss, which in an emergency equates to loss of life [14] . The aim of this WP is to enhance the understanding of the effect of physical and social settings in case of RODs. This is crucial in improving the safety of individuals and groups and to plan strategies, procedures and operations for preventing, controlling and managing risks and to optimize operational decisionmaking in emergency responses. More in detail, WP3 main objectives are to investigate:\n",
            " -Pedestrian dynamics and flows to identify localized critical aspects, evaluating the impacts and cascade effects and analysing its re-arrangement, including the development of evacuation time maps, space utilization maps and density maps. -Behaviour of key agent types, evaluating how their choices in different risk scenarios affect the whole emergency management. -Risk level of different spatial configurations evaluating their degree of criticality and assessment of the performance of different functional areas. -Evacuation procedures to define strategies for evacuation management, including low-level emergency service response and high-level system resilience implementation.\n",
            " The methodologies that are being employed in a synergic manner in the project, are briefly discussed hereafter.\n",
            " Geomatics is widely used in the field of cultural heritage preservation, with the purpose of reconstructing the shape of structures with a high level of accuracy, investigate their conditions and monitor their stability and changes over time. Some interesting applications are discussed in [15] and [16] . At the same time, 3D geomatics data constitute the element on which to base all the activities related to the documentation, the analysis and the enhancement of the built environment, as well as an input in the human behaviour simulation tool helping the decision-maker in risk management activities.\n",
            " The critical issue previously evidenced requires a number of different geomatics methodologies to be employed in the project that are:\n",
            " -Survey techniques useful to acquire 3D data at different scales of investigation (ranging from the single building to the district). Satellite and aerial photogrammetry, including UAV are being used to obtain DEMs [17, 18] . A slightly different approach, included in an open source tool for DEMs generation from high resolution optical satellite imagery, will also be considered [19] . -Monitoring techniques able to identify/measure subsidence/displacement phenomena and temperatures on large areas. Multi-temporal SAR datasets, where available, will provide useful information on both the spatial and temporal patterns of displacements, if present, through the generation of time series [20] using the DInSAR technique, while thermal image acquired from satellite [21] will allow the production of Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps. Satellite dataset will be considered also to assess the albedo value at large scale [22] .\n",
            " Geomatics techniques suitable to be employed are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 3\n",
            " The assessment of cultural heritage prone to climate change (SOD) requires the quantification of resilience as the main instrument in evaluating multi-dimensional risk assessment to SOD. However, the assessment of resilience, by definition, should involve mitigation and adaptation behaviours in a synergic way [23] . In the field of Cultural Heritage, the traditional process of recovery (knowledgediagnosisintervention) should be adapted to the resilient point of view [23] . Because of the cultural relevance, the methodology should include three main goals:\n",
            " -The identification of inherent behaviours of the cultural heritage in decreasing the effects of climate change locally (adaptive characters). -The detection of critical elements in the Built Environment that increase the exposure and affection to climate change, as well as the recognition of the most exposed elements to the effect of climate change (risk exposure). -The study of opportunities offered by complex and critical systems to be transformed to increase the resilient behaviour (mitigation solutions).\n",
            " As aforementioned in Sect. 2.2, the assessment of resilience should involve analysis both at district and building scale.\n",
            " At district scale, local microclimate alterations have to consider geometric and physic features of buildings as well as their environmental conditions. It is the case of protocols useful in determining Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) according to the Oke classification in Local Climate Zones [25] . Geometric and morphological features of buildings, physic characters and anthropogenic loads represents all the characters involved in evaluating classes of exposures to local Heatwave amplification or overheating. Direct local surveys of micro-climate and Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps (by satellite acquisition) represent the main tools in exploring behavioural attitude of district to be prone to local exacerbation of heatwaves (ROD). Moreover, the quantification of albedo value or the reflectance of surfaces is also required at large scale, as the result of large-scale analysis. Albedo physic parameter contributes in modifying local conditions for energy assessment as a consequence of potential temperatures reached by exposed surfaces; for local temperatures variation, the albedo parameter represents the capacity of materials in re-emitting in the system longwave [26] . Values could be computed as their direct measures on a sample (by spectrophotometer) or comparing database and previous data collected for traditional materials.\n",
            " Whereas, software-based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) (e.g. ENVImet) support the creation of virtual models to test mitigation actions at district scale.\n",
            " At building scale, morpho-construction techniques and state of maintenance support the recognition of opportunity of transformation at sub-system scale [27] . However, because of the presence of traditional techniques, direct surveys should be required in order to quantify thermal and optical parameters that can influence the assessment of comfort indoor and the energy needs at building scale. Here, dynamic simulation tools are the main instruments in correlating outdoor microclimate conditionsscaled in previous phaseand indoor energy and comfort results at building scale.\n",
            " The investigation of human factors is of fundamental importance in evaluating risk through emergency plans and operations. An innovative feature of the research to represent dynamic and complex social systems in case of RODs, is the scientific approach through a Multi-Agent modelling and simulation framework [28] .\n",
            " Multi-Agent Systems are particularly suitable for modelling cognitive processes and human interaction between people and their environment. Agent-based modelling performed in the proper manner [29] , can be used to analyse emerging social phenomena at group and crowd level, in our case applied to RODs [30] . This is also the fundamental technique to build computational simulations for these case studies, in order to apply modelling of individuals and social relationships in spatially explicit virtual environments [31] .\n",
            " The computer-based simulation is a method of realistic replication of human activities and use of space. It allows for hypothesis testing, verification and calibration of modelling formalization, the drawing up of recommendations based on the analysis of what if scenarios and the performance analysis of different case studies [32] . The comparison of simulated scenarios will help to define solutions that can improve BE resilience. Additionally, this approach is useful for the study of worst-case scenarios and disruptions that are not directly observable. A final advantage of the proposed methodology is to support knowledge structuring, where the main problem for the decision makers is their missing knowledge and lack of functional models [33] .\n",
            " In this preliminary stage, the main requirements of the 3D dataset have been outlined. With reference to the described activities, the main requirements are:\n",
            " -High resolution DSMs (around meter or better) to support the analysis of morphological features of complex urban systems at districts scale such as the historic ones; here, models support the recognition of geometric and constitutive elements of open areas and elementary linear units (streets) as well as the features of built environment as an aggregate that can modify locally inherent qualities. -High resolution Surface Temperature models in order to support the analysis at large scale of local microclimate alterations derived from urban (inherent) constitutive features and anthropogenic heat loads derived from human activities. In detail, the model resolution should be comparable with (or lower than) the smaller element of the districts that -usually for high compact areas -is the canyon featured by 2-3 m width.\n",
            " Since Multi-Agent systems develop simulations which must represent the dynamic variation of the system under study, the virtual environment built on the DSM should act a changing layer on which the social simulation takes place [34] . Thus, the main requirement for the digital layout of the area is the capacity of representing the real time evolution of risks in order to trigger agents' spatial behaviours [35] . Indeed, in accordance with its transition states, agents adapt their behaviours, e.g. movements.\n",
            " The digital environment not only needs to be dynamic in time, but also in space. These things considered, the digital model of the environment based on the DSM dataset should update at a pace which must fit both with:\n",
            " -The temporal scale of the simulation, which will range from the immediate choices of individuals, e.g. evacuees, first responders and emergency managers, to long term decision making on design, urban regeneration and strategic planning. -The spatial scale of the simulation, which will range from the area surrounding individuals and their behaviour in space, to the configuration of the urban neighbourhood area.\n",
            " The historic districts placed in the municipalities of Ascoli Satriano (FG) and Molfetta (BA), in the Apulia Region -Italy, have been selected as case studies, considering:\n",
            " -Their peculiar location. Referring to the Koppen-Geiger classification, Apulia region has many different climates, due to its orography. The oceanic climate is associated at the promontory of Gargano, in the north-east part, and the subappennine zone, located at north-west, both featured by high altitude; whereas along the cost and hills, humid sub-tropical (Cfa) and hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa) climates are predominant. Ascoli Satriano and Molfetta are located in the Daunian sub-appennine and on the eastern coasts respectively. Consequently, they are representative of two major Apulian climates, Cfa and Csa [36] . Thus, the two municipalities differ also in terms of Heating Degree Days (HDD) as defined by Italian law: Ascoli Satriano has 1652 HDD representative of climatic zone D, while Molfetta has 1142 HDD, and is included in climatic zone C.\n",
            " -The different morphology on built environment. As a clear consequence of local values and previous events, Molfetta and Ascoli Satriano show different morphologies in district arrangement. The two districts mainly include residential buildings; however, tower houseswith vertical development of dwelling on 3-4 floorsare representative for Molfetta's district, while dwellings in Ascoli Satriano are featured by two floors and a horizontal development. -Construction materials. Molfetta is representative of the traditional use of calcareous squared stonewith regular bonds -as prevalent construction material. Here, the structures are usually associated to compounded walls made by two layers of stone (inner and outer) and an incoherent system of mortar and slices of stones in the middle. Roofs are usually flat and have a structural wooden sub-layer. In the outer part there are both traditional (calcareous stone paving) and modern (paving or bituminous layers) materials. On the other hand, buildings in the historic districts of Ascoli Satriano are featured by pitched roofs while walls are very heterogeneous. In fact, walls made by small bricks and tufa blocks were combined with or substituted the original one made by irregular bonds of calcareous stones. -Their representativeness of two ancient towns typical of the Italian landscape. From a preliminary evaluation of their plan and topography, both case studies present interesting typological affinities and comparable differences, hereafter described, which may play a determinant role in influencing pedestrian spatial behaviour during emergencies.\n",
            " • Molfetta is a coastal town. Its origins can be traced to a small fisherman's village. The historic district is a peninsula surrounded by the Adriatic Sea on three sides. Until the 1800s, the water lapped the southern side which made the old town almost an island. The plan has the shape of an ellipse with the sites of the cathedral and the castle (destroyed in 1416, now Town Hall Square) in its vertices. Along the minor axis is the main street where 14 side streets converge. These streets run parallel and present sudden changes of section, in ancient times this had the function of trapping and disorienting enemies if they managed to enter the city. • Ascoli Satriano is located on the edge of the Apennines. In 1456 an earthquake totally destroyed the ancient site and forced relocation of the surviving inhabitants to the site of the current town. Since then the planimetric layout of the old town centre has remained unchanged despite it has been rebuilt many times following seismic events. This is characterized by a labyrinth of narrow alleys that climb up the hillside. This orography determines the spatial configuration and distribution of the streets of the ancient city, which is dominated by the Ducal Palace. This is a massive building placed at the highest point to protect against war attacks from the plain. On the opposite side the cathedral, as a landmark, stands out among lower buildings. The other hillside is steeper, inaccessible and with no buildings, this allows for wide views over the valley. -The different exposure to natural disasters, both for BE and man. Figure 1 and Fig. 2 highlighted the risk exposure to earthquake, landslide for Ascoli Satriano e Molfetta respectively, as well as human and built vulnerability for classes of ages and period of construction. -Ongoing subsidence phenomena affecting Ascoli Satriano that can provide further elements to the multi risk analysis. Displacements in the satellite Line Of Sight direction, obtained from DInSAR data, are evidenced by permanent scatterers (dots in Fig. 3 ) that show a velocity of displacements of some centimeters per year.\n",
            " Available geomatics data are listed in Table 3 . Table 3 . Available geomatics data [39] Digital terrain model Cell size = 8 Â 8 m Ortophoto Res. = 0,5 Â 0,5 BE shapefiles\n",
            " The assessment of the consequences of SOD and ROD on the BE and its users represent a complex task, due to the difficulties in the prompt detection of critical events (both in the long and short-term period), and the proper evaluation of the human behaviour in response to such events. The particular constructive characteristics (narrow/crowded streets, presence of ancient/valuable buildings and heterogeneous constructive techniques/materials) of historical centres makes them more prone to be damaged by ROD and SOD effects.\n",
            " Recent catastrophic episodes, along with the growing awareness of the increasing negative action of the weathering due to climate change, underline the need to improve the resilience of the historical BE towards these events. This problem necessarily requires an integrated approach that must take into account the topography and the constructive elements of the investigated areas and consider the human factor and its interaction with the BE during potentially critical occurrences.\n",
            " As discussed in this work, geomatics methodologies applied at the high-resolution survey and monitoring of the cultural heritage provide a very useful tool for measuring and controlling the evolution of historical centres. However, a thorough assessment of the problem requires also accurate information on the efficiency of the buildings for mitigating the negative effects of SOD, as well as reliable dimensionally constrained simulation models of the human behaviour in case of ROD.\n",
            " Over the next three years, the ResCUDE project will allow to carry out in-depth analyses on the identified case studies, integrating spatial, human and behavioural data, improving the processes of knowledge, evaluation, control, management and design of the BE in relation to the risks deriving from ROD and SOD events. The expected outputs will be used to define possible scenarios for civil defence purposes and undertake actions aimed at risk mitigation. Findings can be included in emergency planning for decision makers and emergency managers.\n",

            "Title: Tropical Sprue in 2014: the New Face of an Old Disease\n",
            "Body Text: Tropical sprue (TS) or tropical malabsorption, believed to have disappeared even in tropical countries despite contradictory evidence, is the commonest cause of sporadic malabsorption syndrome (MAS) in northern, southern, and eastern parts of India even currently [1••, 2•, 3, 4, 5••]. It is a condition in which malabsorption occurs in absence of an identified specific etiology primarily in the tropical regions of the world [6, 7•] . TS is diagnosed based on the following criteria: (a) compatible clinical presentation, (b) demonstration of malabsorption of two unrelated substances, (c) abnormal smallintestinal mucosal histology, which may be patchy, (d) exclusion of other specific causes for MAS (except small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth [SIBO]), and (e) persistent response to treatment with antibiotics such as tetracycline and folic acid [2•] . Compatible clinical presentation is very important as abnormal small-bowel mucosal histology has been reported in tropics even in asymptomatic subjects, a condition called as tropical enteropathy [8] . Tropical enteropathy, however, is not same as TS ( Table 1) .\n",
            " How Common Was TS in the Past?\n",
            " In the past, most believed that TS was the commonest cause of MAS in Indian adults [9] [10] [11] . In fact, epidemics of chronic diarrhea and MAS following acute infective gastroenteritis (referred to as \"postinfectious tropical malabsorption\") were reported from India [12•] . In a study from four villages from southern India in 1968, 8-20 % villagers, suffering from an attack of acute infective diarrhea continued to experience liquidity and frequency of stool who were diagnosed to have TS [1••] . Several other studies reported epidemics of diarrhea with features suggestive of TS in India [13] [14] [15] [16] . The Madras State health reports recorded five epidemics of chronic diarrhea of unknown etiology that clinically resembled TS between 1930 and 1942 [17] . Epidemics of TS also occurred among soldiers and prisoners of war in the Indo-Burma region during the Second World War, in American military personnel serving in the Philippines and in Bangladesh [6, 7•, 18] . A similar condition was also reported sporadically from temperate countries where it was named \"temperate sprue\" [19] .\n",
            " It has been conventionally believed that with improvement in socioeconomic status and hygiene and increased use of antibiotics and probiotics, there has been a reduction in frequency of sporadic TS. There is, however, hardly any evidence in favor of this hypothesis; in contrast, there has been several studies reported recently that contradict this hypothesis. In a recent study on 275 patients with sporadic MAS from Lucknow, India, 101 (37 %) had TS, which was the single commonest cause of MAS [5••] . In another study from a large teaching hospital in New Delhi, India, though celiac disease was the single commonest cause of MAS (62 %), 22 % had TS [3] . In a study reported from a hospital in Vellore, located in the southern region of India, 36 (29 %) of 124 adult patients with sporadic MAS had TS, which was the single commonest cause in this population [4] . In an earlier study from Lucknow, India, 39/99 (39 %) patients with MAS were diagnosed having TS using very rigorous criteria [2•] . All these studies clearly contradict the belief that sporadic form of TS has disappeared currently. In fact, most reports have suggested that the sporadic form of TS is frequently seen in India even today [20•] . Patients with TS have also been reported sporadically even recently from other parts of the world. Two American subjects living in Thailand and Vietnam were reported to have TS in 2013 [21] . Two other cases who developed TS after returning from Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Peru were reported in 2010 from the USA [22] .\n",
            " However, epidemics of TS have not been reported recently. This argument has been used to support the hypothesis that frequency of TS has reduced currently. An important issue to be reviewed here relates to a recently described entity called postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) [23•] . In this condition, following an episode of acute gastrointestinal infection associated with at least two of the followings (a) diarrhea, (b) vomiting, (c) fever, and (d) isolation of enteropathogen on stool culture, patients develops IBS for the first time [23•] . Most patients with PI-IBS have diarrhea-predominant disease [23•] . Initial studies on PI-IBS were reported from Sheffield, UK [24] [25] [26] [27] . Subsequently, several studies have been reported from other temperate countries in the world such as Canada, North America, South Korea, and China [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Would this condition, in which stool continued to remain frequent and liquid after an episode of acute gastroenteritis, be called as temperate sprue if described five decades ago? The answer to this question would be affirmative if the patients were found to have biochemical evidence of mucosal malabsorption on D-xylose test, fecal fat estimation, and abnormal small-intestinal histology. However, in no study that described PI-IBS, tests for mucosal malabsorption and small-intestinal mucosal histology were reported. Hence, it is difficult to say whether a proportion of these patients with socalled PI-IBS could have suffered from postinfectious tropical malabsorption or TS. Obviously, this form of postinfectious tropical malabsorption is similar to epidemic form of TS.\n",
            " There is considerable overlap in epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment of postinfectious tropical malabsorption or TS and PI-IBS (Table 2) . Briefly, 7-31 % patients with acute gastroenteritis have been reported to develop PI-IBS, a frequency quite similar (8-20 %) to that reported for postinfectious tropical malabsorption, whereas the latter condition was reported about five to six decades ago, interest in the former condition emerged primarily during last two decades [7•, 33] . Both the conditions have similar pathogenesis and treatment ( Table 2) . Though several studies on PI-IBS have been reported from temperate countries recently, not a single study on this condition has been reported recently in the areas of the world where epidemic of TS was reported [23•, 34] . Unfortunately, not a single study reported till date on PI-IBS performed tests for mucosal malabsorption and small-intestinal biopsy to exclude that these patients were suffering from PI-IBS and not postinfectious tropical malabsorption. In fact, a few studies reported abnormal smallintestinal permeability (SIP) in patients with diarrheapredominant IBS (IBS-D) with or without SIBO [35, 36] , some of whom might have PI-IBS; in fact, abnormal SIP might suggest presence of mucosal malabsorption; and abnormal SIP is well known in patients with TS [37••] . Therefore, based on the above evidence, it is logical to believe that a disorder somewhat similar to that described from southern We believe that following an acute gastroenteritis, though some patients recover completely, others may continue to have bowel dysfunction, which may be due to postinfectious tropical malabsorption or due to PI-IBS ( Fig. 1 ). Tests for mucosal malabsorption and small-intestinal histology are essential to differentiate between these two conditions. Hence, we suggest that in the future iteration of Rome criteria for diagnosis of PI-IBS, it is important to consider this issue and modify the criteria for diagnosis of PI-IBS as suggested in Table 3 .\n",
            " Pathogenesis of TS is multifactorial [38] . These factors include, gut dysbiosis including small-intestinal bacterial colonization and overgrowth, dysregulated host's immune response leading to protracted inflammation, reduced gut defense, abnormal SIP, villous atrophy, mucosal disaccharidase deficiency including that of lactase, bile acid de-conjugation, neuro-hormonal dysregulation, exaggerated fat-induced ileal brake leading to slow mouth-to-cecum transit promoting bacterial colonization, deficiency of vitamin B 12 and folate causing megaloblastosis of small-intestinal epitheliums, and colonic dysfunction leading to reduced colonic water Bacterial colonization (10/13, 77 % vs. 3/12, 25 %, respectively) and overgrowth (4/13, 31 % vs. 0/12, 0 %, respectively) were commoner in patients with TS than controls as demonstrated in an earlier study [39••] . Bacteria in the small intestine alters enterocyte brush-border motility [42] , deconjugate bile acids preventing its enterohepatic circulation [43] . As de-conjugated bile acids cannot form chylomicrons, fatty acid absorption is impaired causing steatorrhea [44] . Deconjugated bile acids also directly inhibit carbohydrate transporters, reduce intraluminal pH, and further damage intestinal enterocytes creating a self-perpetuating cycle [42] . Bacteria produce other metabolites such as acetate and formate [44] , which may affect intestinal function. Bacterial colonization and overgrowth cause alteration of duodenal morphology, namely, villous atrophy and an increase in intra-epithelial lymphocytes, which return to normal on antibiotic treatment [39••] . In TS, many different bacteria have been isolated including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloace, and patients can harbor one or more highly toxigenic strains [45] .\n",
            " Bacterial colonization in the upper gut is known to occur in children and adults with acute diarrheal disease in temperate areas of the world [46, 47] . Similar findings have been shown in tropical areas such as in Calcutta (currently renamed Kolkata) in association with acute gastroenteritis due to E. coli, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, or a variety of nonspecific enteric bacteria [48] . Moreover, bacterial contamination in the jejunum was found to persist in these patients up to 4 months after the original infection [48] . One study reported reduced secretion of gastric acid in patients with TS, though salivary IgA was normal [49] . In another study, a proportion of patients with TS were found to have hypogammaglobulinemia [50] . Obviously, these factors would result into reduced innate immunity of gut causing bacterial colonization and overgrowth in the small bowel in the presence of inadequate food hygiene, which is not uncommon in areas of the world where TS has been reported. Zinc supplementation is known to improve gut defense and improve SIP. Zinc supplementation reduced the severity and duration of diarrhea in infants and young children, in an earlier study from India [51] . But, there is no study of zinc in relation to TS. In a report on a single patient with TS developing following journey to Sri Lanka, low level of zinc was detected [52] . However, more studies using sophisticated immunological techniques may uncover many other aspects of reduced gut defense in patients with TS.\n",
            " Two earlier studies suggested that protozoa and fungi may play an important role in the pathogenesis of TS [53, 54] . Cryptosporidium parvum, Isospora belli, Blastocystis hominis, and Cyclospora cayetanensis have been identified in fecal samples and small-intestinal biopsy specimens of people suffering from various forms of prolonged diarrhea in the tropics [53] [54] [55] . Moreover, viral particles resembling orthomyxo and coronaviruses have been demonstrated in the feces of 90 % of patients with TS from southern India [56] .\n",
            " Normal SIP is necessary for physiological function of the small bowel including absorption [57] . SIP is abnormal in several diseases associated with altered small-intestinal functions such as IBS-D, PI-IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Postdysenteric gut dysfunction might result from persistent low-grade inflammation in enteric submucosal and neuromuscular compartments, as shown from studies in animals and human [63] . In patients with IBS-D and PI-IBS, increase in permeability could promote neuromuscular inflammation that disturbs enteric sensation and motility. Abnormal SIP has been reported in patients with TS. A study on estimation of SIP using urinary excretion of lactulose and mannitol by 1H-NMR spectroscopy on a small number of patients with MAS (n=18), including eight patients with TS and healthy controls (n=28), showed that the urinary excretion ratio of lactulose to mannitol was higher in patients with MAS as compared to healthy controls [64] . Also, urinary excretion of lactulose was higher in patients with TS but excretion of mannitol was the same as compared with healthy controls [64] . Another study on SIP using urinary excretion of lactulose and L-rhamnose showed that urinary excretion of lactulose was higher in TS patients as compared with healthy controls [65] . The magnitude of the absorption defects demonstrated in patients with TS was more severe than would be anticipated from the jejunal mucosal abnormalities [65] . In another study, abnormal SIP among patients with TS persisted in spite of treatment in a proportion of patients; [37••] those with persistently abnormal SIP continued to pass more frequent stool and gained less weight than those in whom it got normalized [37••] .\n",
            " Is TS Related to Neuro-Hormonal Dysregulation?\n",
            " TS is known to be associated with small-bowel stasis, which predispose to small-intestinal bacterial colonization and overgrowth [39••] . Small-bowel stasis in patients with TS may result from exaggerated ileal brake induced by malabsorbed fat passing through the ileum, which liberate gut hormones like peptide YY, neurotensin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (Fig. 2) [39••, 66••]. Gut hormones play a major role in intestinal motility. Hormones such as enteroglucagon, peptide YY, and neurotensin slow transit while motilin enhances the rate of gastric emptying and hastens small-intestinal motility [67, 68] . In an earlier study, patients with TS had raised basal plasma motilin and enteroglucagon concentrations, but their postprandial release of both gastric inhibitory polypeptide and insulin was significantly reduced [69] . In two earlier studies, orocaecal transit time (OCTT) was found to be longer in patients with TS than in controls [ [70] . In a recent study, infusion of fat into the proximal small intestine was shown to inhibit antroduodenal motility, delay duodeno-cecal transit time, and increase plasma levels of peptide YY and neurotensin than among controls [66••] . Though the same mechanism of fatinduced ileal brake may operate in patients with MAS and steatorrhoea due to any cause, such as celiac disease and chronic pancreatitis, it has been studied only in patients with TS [66••].\n",
            " In patients with MAS such as TS, a larger amount of fluid passes through the ileocecal valve than the healthy subjects [66••] . Colon can increase its capacity to absorb electrolytes and water to compensate for the higher amount of fluid coming to the colon to prevent occurrence of diarrhea. Ramakrishna et al. showed that in patients with TS, there is abnormality in the colon that prevents this compensatory mechanism predisposing to occurrence of diarrhea [71] [72] [73] .\n",
            " Is TS Due to Vitamin B 12 and Folate Malaborption?\n",
            " Deficiencies of folate and vitamin B 12 may favor the development of TS by causing megaloblastosis of small-intestinal epithelium [74] . Vegetarians are at risk for vitamin B 12 deficiency due to suboptimal intake [75] . A large proportion of Indian subjects are vegetarian, which may predispose to the deficiency of vitamin B 12 . Moreover, SIBO may predispose to vitamin B 12 deficiency as occurring in blind loop syndrome [76] . Although vitamin B 12 absorption is frequently improved by antibiotics, it may not return to normal levels despite prolonged therapy [77] . There may be, therefore, a coexistent mucosal lesion as previously described in E. coli-contaminated rats and small-intestinal diverticulosis in man [78, 79] . In a previous study on 38 patients with vitamin B 12 malabsorption, antibiotic therapy resulted in a rapid return of vitamin B 12 absorption to normal in 50 % of the patients [12•] . In another study, vitamin B 12 absorption returned to normal and there was a marked decrease in total luminal flora in all three subjects who were treated with tetracycline [79] . Furthermore, there was some correlation between the bacteriological findings in both the jejunum and ileum and vitamin B 12 malabsorption [80] . In the jejunal aspirates of patients with vitamin B 12 malabsorption, the mean log counts of aerobic flora, total flora, and bacteroides were greater than the counts in the controls and in the ileal aspirates, all except one of the patients with vitamin B 12 malabsorption had bacteria present in counts greater than 10 4 colony forming units/milliliter (CFU/mL) [80] . Whereas in those with normal vitamin B 12 absorption, only one fourth had bacterial growth and none had more than 10 3 CFU/mL [80] . This might suggest that bacteria to produce toxins altering small-intestinal physiology. Such a mechanism has been postulated for E. coli in a case of diverticulosis [79] . However, further studies to examine the nature of the cellular lesion responsible for the vitamin B 12 absorptive defect in TS and the possible role of bacteria in its pathogenesis are required. Empirical antibiotic treatment has been shown to improve diarrhea and associated malnutrition in most patients with TS [77, 81] . Most studies have been done with tetracycline and sulfonamides [81, 82] . It has been shown that folate and vitamin B 12 absorption improves markedly and symptoms resolve early with antibiotics [83] . Treatment with folic acid alone can be curative early in the course of the disease [84] . It has been proposed that antibiotics reduce the overall bacterial load in the gut leading to reduced inflammation and thus improving diarrhea [85] . Prolonged treatment with tetracycline may be required for complete resolution of symptoms. Tetracycline is generally given for 2 months. In a recent study, rifaximin was tried in treatment of TS without encouraging result [86] . More studies, however, are needed on this issue.\n",
            " Adequate dietary management is the key for the management of TS. Steatorrhea is a common feature of TS and contributes significantly to diarrhea [87, 88] . Antibiotics and vitamins may not completely cure steatorrhea. Cause of steatorrhea is multifactorial-mucosal malabsorption of fat, bacteria-splitting bile acids, and impaired enterohepatic recirculation of bile salts [89] . Restriction of long-chain fatty acids may help in reducing steatorrhea. It should be replaced by medium-chain triglycerides. Coconut oil, which is rich in mediumchain fatty acids, may be helpful in reducing diarrhea [90] . Moreover, malabsorbed fat might cause exaggerated ileal brake reducing gut motility, promoting SIBO and malabsorption in TS [39••] . Protein and carbohydrate intake should be guided by the weight and body mass index.\n",
            " Long-term prognosis of patients with TS with proper dietary management and antibiotics plus vitamins is good. However, in endemic regions, the disease may have relapsing course requiring repeated cycles of antibiotics. Also, not all patients who improve symptomatically have complete resolution of small-intestinal histology and functions such as SIP [39••, 91] .\n",
            " TS, once thought to be a common cause of MAS, is now believed to be uncommon, though the evidence contradicts this belief. There is significant overlap between TS and PI-IBS. In fact, PI-IBS and TS may be continuing spectrum of response of the gut to an episode of infectious gastroenteritis (Fig. 4) . Since pathogenesis of TS and PI-IBS is similar, we may need to learn about management of PI-IBS from our knowledge on management of TS. More research is needed on this issue.\n",

            "Title: The where and when of COVID-19: Using ecological and Twitter-based assessments to examine impacts in a temporal and community context\n",
            "Body Text: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals and communities have had to adapt to the evolving public health threat. Existing literature has observed increased psychological distress, anxiety, and negative affect among individuals across the pandemic period overall [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, less is known about how individuals and communities responded across the early months of 2020, during which changes in policies, threat levels, and disease information were frequent. Leveraging longitudinal data from individuals and their surrounding community before and during the early pandemic, the present study examined changes in psychological well-being among a sample of older adults living in the Bronx, New York. Thus, the individuals in the sample represent a population of interest due to their age, geographic location, and timing of data collection, factors relevant to the study of psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated these changes in psychological well-being from two perspectives: withinperson change from a 2019 pre-pandemic baseline to 2020 during the early spike in cases in the New York City area, as well as community-level change over this period in the same area. For this study, the community was defined as a geographic community, specifically Bronx County. To examine within-person change, we used data from the Einstein Aging Study (EAS), an ongoing longitudinal measurement burst study [8] . The EAS sample consists of older adults residing in Bronx County, New York. EAS participants reported on their thoughts, mood, stress, affect, and loneliness multiple times per day for several weeks; these intensive periods of repeated surveys are referred to as measurement \"bursts\" of ecological momentary assessment (EMA). We compared each participant's reports from the early pandemic (February-June 2020) to their own reports from their prior year's measurement burst. To examine community-level change in EAS participants' surrounding environments, we used language-based assessments [9] of community distress from public Twitter posts made by Bronx County users during the same periods as EAS data collection. We then compared the individual-level and community-level data to examine how indicators of psychological wellbeing from two sources correlated and fluctuated across 2019 and 2020.\n",
            " Although some studies have observed a general decline in psychological well-being over the pandemic period, recent research suggests that older adults may be somewhat protected against pandemic-related distress [10, 11] , a finding consistent with broad interpretations of Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST) which posits that older adults are more likely to be motivated to maintain positive emotions and to engage in emotion regulation strategies relative to younger adults, thus promoting affective well-being [12] . According to Strength and Vulnerability Integration (SAVI) [13] , however, especially when encountering stressors, preexisting individual differences may undermine older adults' strengths at emotion regulation and diminish age-benefits in emotional well-being compared to younger people [14] . For example, for those older adults who appraised the pandemic as challenging (perhaps due to an elevated health risk, cognitive impairment, or personality-related tendencies toward negative appraisal) may not have experienced affective protective effects of older age in the pandemic [15] .\n",
            " To capture this possible heterogeneity in older adults' psychological well-being during the early pandemic, personality traits and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) measured prior to the pandemic were examined as potential moderators. Extraversion and neuroticism were selected because of their relevance to psychological well-being and aging [16, 17] . MCI was tested as a moderator because participants with MCI may report worse psychological well-being, relative to participants without MCI, due to expected, non-pandemic trends (e.g., declining cognitive health across time) [18] . In the context of SAVI, MCI represents a negative experience that could contribute to lower levels of psychological well-being, independent of the pandemic.\n",
            " Because the pandemic is an unfolding event with varying community public health restrictions, positivity rates, mortality rates, and individuals' understanding of risk, making conclusions from longitudinal data can be complicated. Real-time alignment with community context is needed to understand such a dynamic event, but few data lend themselves to quantitative study at a large scale. Identifying the \"start\" of an unfolding event in a community can be difficult, and in the absence of an external gauge, any pre-pandemic to during-pandemic change detected could be due to numerous sources (e.g., seasonal variation, unrelated events, aging-related change). Thus, to \"triangulate\" [19] the likely explanation for any change observed, we incorporated longitudinal contextual data on well-being from the community in which participants resided.\n",
            " To construct well-being scores representing the surrounding Bronx community in which EAS participants resided, we extracted features from public Twitter posts made by Bronx County users during the time periods when EAS participants completed their measurement bursts. The Twitter posts that were assessed were not composed by EAS participants, but rather Twitter users in Bronx County during the time of EAS data collection. Past work has shown that Twitter users can be reliable \"canaries in the coal mine\" for community well-being [20, 21] . For example, psychological characteristics (e.g., anger, interpersonal tension) derived from language in Twitter posts within a community have been used to predict heart disease mortality risk within the same community [20] . Impressively, these Twitter extractions outperformed well-known risks from demographic, socioeconomic, and health characteristics such as smoking, diabetes, and hypertension. Thus, our second goal was to examine within-community change in well-being over the same 2019-2020 period as examined in the EAS individuals. Importantly, we investigated not only the longitudinal trends but also sought to illuminate the topics that may have produced the changes observed.\n",
            " Lastly, we compared the individual and community. This novel approach of contextualizing individual-level EMA reports with Twitter community markers is uniquely suited to address questions about psychological well-being during a rapidly evolving community-level event. During the early months of 2020, COVID-19 information and risks were rapidly changing, but the way that these larger community changes impacted individuals is unknown. Given the many ways individuals interact with their communities, for psychological and other health researchers understanding the participants' community environment may provide available, no-burden, and invaluable, but overlooked data on the impact of a shared threat.\n",
            " Individual-level data. EAS participants were recruited through systematic random sampling from Medicare and New York City Registered Voter Lists for Bronx County [22] . Collection of EMA measurement burst data began in May 2017, continued throughout 2020, and is ongoing. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study and participants provided written informed consent.\n",
            " EAS follows more than 300 participants with follow-up scheduled across the calendar year. To provide the clearest examination of possible initial pandemic effects, this analysis focused on 78 EAS participants who completed a 14-day EMA burst prior to and during the initial COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., participants that provided data at two bursts). Table 1 summarizes participants' MCI status, age, and other demographic variables reported prior to the pandemic. For this analysis, we considered participants that began their 2020 burst on or after February 1, 2020 to have completed the burst during the COVID-19 pandemic. This date roughly corresponds to when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a public health emergency on January 30, 2020 [23] and when the United States declared COVID-19 a public health emergency for the United States on February 3, 2020 [24] . As of February 4, 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 24 countries, including 11 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States [25] . The earliest participant to complete their burst during the pandemic period began the burst on February 5, 2020. These 78 participants completed their pre-COVID burst between November 28, 2018 and October 22, 2019 with a mean of 357 days between the two bursts (see Table 1 ). S1 Community-level data. Language based assessments were conducted on publicly available Twitter posts from the 2019 and 2020 weeks that overlapped with EAS data collection. These posts were created by users whose IDs were mapped to Bronx County following a previously validated approach [26] . This study aimed to examine well-being across individuals and their geographic community, thus we selected Tweets from accounts that had previously been mapped to Bronx County [27] because the EAS participants were sampled from Bronx County. The mapping approach detailed in past work [26, 27] was done in one of two ways. Some Tweets are geotagged to a specific location when posted because a small percentage of Twitter users have enabled geolocation coordinates on their account (this represented approximately 10% of the Tweets). Alternatively, because most Tweets did not include a geolocation, we used the free response location field where users could attach a location to each of their Tweets. Text in this field was matched to lists of unique city and location names that were within Bronx County. A subsample of Tweets that had both location information in the text field and geolocation data was used to confirm that the checking process was valid for locations in Bronx County. This automatic approach for determining the location of Tweets has previously been shown to be 93% accurate in reflecting a user's location [26] . These methods comply with Twitter's Terms and Conditions for the use of publicly available Tweets. Retweets and messages containing URLs were excluded because these contain non-original content. The relative frequencies of words and phrases were then extracted and input to artificial intelligence-based models of constructs detailed below. This approach used validated algorithms which extract features (i.e., quantitative variables) from the language patterns, and then find reliable associations between combinations of features and established self-report scales, such as personality measures of the construct [28] [29] [30] .\n",
            " Although EAS participants were not necessarily Twitter users, the posts provide information on the conversations occurring within the Bronx community in which the EAS participants resided, during the same periods when participants were completing their EMA bursts. Twitter was selected as the social media platform for three reasons. First, past work has identified COVID-19 related topics among Tweets [31] . Second, Twitter has been used as a tool in past public health work [32] , including during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 [33] and a cholera outbreak in Haiti in 2010 [34] . Although demographic data were not collected for Twitter users, these users were likely to differ demographically compared to EAS participants (particularly on age) based on national averages of Twitter users [35] . The use of Twitter is not intended to be representative of older adults' experiences, rather these data are meant to characterize the broader Bronx community. Past research has shown that despite the overrepresentation of younger individuals, Twitter content covaries with psychological and health outcomes in the community [20, 26] . Third, as these past studies mention, Twitter's role as a micro-blogging social media site makes it a likely platform where users would discuss the rapid changes and implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation policies.\n",
            " Individual level: EAS participant data. Individual difference measures. Individual difference measures used in this analysis were assessed in 2019. Personality. Participants completed the Big Five Inventory [36] . Eight items each were used to assess extraversion and neuroticism; scores for extraversion and neuroticism were calculated as the mean of their respective items. In this sample, Cronbach's alpha was 0.62 for extraversion and 0.71 for neuroticism. Mild Cognitive Impairment. MCI status was determined on the basis of comprehensive neuropsychological assessment according to Jak/Bondi criteria [22, 37, 38] .\n",
            " Repeated measures. EMA data used in this study were collected before and during the pandemic for each participant. COVID Onset was a dummy variable created to represent the time of EMA data collection with 0 representing the EMA period participants completed prior to the pandemic and 1 representing the EMA period participants completed during the pandemic.\n",
            " Participants used visual analogue slider scales (scored from 0-100) on study-provided smartphones to report on each EMA item. Thought unpleasantness, subjective stress, and mood valence were assessed up to six times daily and momentary emotional states and thoughts were measured up to five times daily. Thought Unpleasantness was assessed with the question \"In the past 5 minutes, what type of thoughts were you having?\" using a slider from \"unpleasant\" to \"pleasant\". For interpretation, this item was reverse-scored such that higher scores indicated more unpleasant thoughts. Stress was assessed via the question, \"Right now, how stressed are you?\" and used a slider from \"not at all\" to \"extremely\". Mood valence was assessed with the question, \"Right now how is your overall mood?\" with a slider from \"bad\" to \"good\" such that higher scores represented more positive valence. Momentary feelings of Tense/Anxious, Depressed, Frustrated, and Lonely were assessed as separate items, \"Right now, do you feel. . .?\" using sliders from \"not at all\" to \"extremely\" for each item. Thought Control and Worry were assessed with the questions, \"In the past 5 minutes were you having a train of thought that you couldn't get out of your head?\" and \"In the past 5 minutes, were you thinking about personal problems or worries?,\" respectively, using sliders from \"not at all\" to \"very much\".\n",
            " Community-level: Bronx community markers extracted from Twitter. Depressivity and anxiety. Artificial intelligence-based assessments of community depressivity and anxiety were extracted from Twitter posts using existing models. These models were trained in prior work by analyzing individuals' social media posts with their responses to a validated conventional personality measure-the NEO-PI-R which includes depression and anxiety facet scores [39] . Specifically, English-speaking Facebook users (predominantly from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom) opted-in to complete the NEO-PI-R and provided access to their Facebook posts such that online word usage and personality traits could be correlated [28] . The NEO-PI-R assessment of anxiety and depressivity facets were extracted from Twitter posts in the current study. Scores of depressivity represent the use of negative low arousal language and scores of anxiety represent the use of negative high arousal language [30] . In these models, a machine learning-based regression model was applied to words and phrases used in Twitter posts to extract scores on the depressivity and anxiety facets at the community level [40] . Using these validated pre-trained models, continuous community scores were produced such that higher scores represent greater amounts of depressivity and anxiety. This approach has recently been used to predict psychological well-being. Specifically, depressivity and anxiety scores derived from interview transcripts using the same artificial intelligence models predicted posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in World Trade Center attacks first responders [30] .\n",
            " Affective valence. Similar to the method used for depressivity and anxiety scores, words and phrases from Twitter posts were used to identify affective valence of language used. The model used to extract affective valence from Twitter posts in the present study was trained on a separate dataset of social media posts. In this prior work, the valence and arousal of 2,895 posts were rated by two independent psychologists (kappa > 0.80) [40] . These ratings were then used to develop a model that predicted the valence rating of posts based on the language used [41] . Applied to the present study, the frequency of words and phrases used in posts were weighted and a continuous community affective valence score of the words and phrases was produced [41] . Lower scores represent more negatively-valenced affect.\n",
            " COVID-19 topics. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method was used to identify topics based on automatically grouped clusters of words [42] . This approach was used to quantify the discussion around COVID-19 each week. Prior work derived 120 \"content-specific topics\" over a corpus of COVID-19-related tweets from January through August 2020 [31] . To find the topics most indicative of each week, we scored their relative frequency of the week versus all other weeks using the log-odds IDP metric [43] . We then summarized the topics scoring highest for the given week by plotting its most frequent words in a word cloud, where size indicates prevalence.\n",
            " The individual-level data from EAS participants were analyzed using separate multi-level models for each EMA outcome using proc mixed in SAS version 9.4 [44] . Each outcome was assessed separately as opposed to calculating composite scores (e.g., a single negative affect score or a negative cognition score) as the outcome to maintain granularity. It is not clear how the pandemic may have impacted specific aspects of negative affect or negative cognition among older adults; thus, each outcome was assessed separately. In each model, COVID onset was a level 1 predictor; gender, age, MCI status, extraversion, and neuroticism were level 2 predictors. Follow-up models included COVID onset X extraversion, COVID onset X neuroticism, and the COVID onset X MCI status interaction terms.\n",
            " Community markers extracted from Twitter were used to contextualize participants' responses to EMA measures and provide descriptive information about the time during which participants were completing these EMA bursts. The correlation between Twitter community markers and corresponding EMA responses for each week was calculated for 2019 and 2020. That is, responses on the tense/anxious, depressed, and mood valence EMA items were averaged within each participant across all observations the individual completed during each week. These weekly person averages were then averaged to provide a weekly sample-average score of tense/anxious, depressed, and mood valence for each week in 2019 and 2020 (for which data were available, 32 weeks in 2019 and 19 weeks in 2020). This approach mirrors the aggregation approach used to collect the Twitter community markers such that scores of anxiety, depressivity, and affect from users' tweets were aggregated across the week and then a mean community marker score was calculated across all users that contributed tweets during each week of the year. The aggregation approaches in the two datasets allowed for a comparison at a weekly level of how EAS participants' individual-level reports aligned with Twitterbased community marker scores in the same week.\n",
            " Summary statistics for the 2019 and 2020 individual-level data from EAS participants are provided in Table 2 . S1 Fig in the Supplemental Material shows weekly counts of EMA participants and Twitter users. In longitudinal models for the individual-level data, likelihood ratio tests provided evidence that including the random effect of COVID onset (i.e., allowing for individual differences in slopes) improved model fit for each EMA outcome compared to models that did not include this random effect. This implies significant individual differences in the patterns of change from 2019 to 2020. All multilevel models with individual-level data used an unstructured covariance structure.\n",
            " Separate multilevel models were used to test within-person change from 2019 to 2020 in EAS participants' two-week average momentary ratings of thought unpleasantness, stress, mood valence, thought control, worry, feeling tense/anxious, feeling depressed, feeling frustrated, and feeling lonely. S1 1) . MCI did not significantly moderate within-person change for any outcome.\n",
            " Effect sizes for significant results were calculated using pseudo R 2 to determine the proportion of variance explained in the outcome variable. The COVID onset variable explained 2.88% of the level 1 variance in the loneliness variable. For the significant interaction effects, neuroticism explained 4.33% of the variance in the COVID onset slope for the thought unpleasantness outcome and 1.12% of the variance in the COVID onset slope for the depressed outcome.\n",
            " A priori power analyses were not conducted because when the longitudinal study began in 2017, it was not designed to answer questions about an unexpected pandemic. To provide the clearest within-person comparison and limit the influence of other major societal events later in 2020, the sample size in the current analyses was limited to participants that completed burst periods both before and during the early pandemic. To provide additional insight regarding the observed significant effects, we applied the multilevel models reported above to 1,000 randomly sampled datasets drawn from the full sample size in the observed dataset. The multilevel model with loneliness as the outcome variable was conducted on each sampled dataset, each of which included 10 randomly selected participants from the observed data. The within-person change in mean loneliness rating from 2019 to 2020 (i.e., the fixed effect of COVID onset) was significant in 87.2% of the 1,000 simulated datasets with a sample size of 10 participants. This suggests a relatively robust effect observed in the full dataset for within-person change in loneliness. This process was repeated for the models that showed significant COVID onset X neuroticism effects. For the thought unpleasantness outcome, the COVID onset X neuroticism effect was significant in 66.4% of the 1,000 simulated datasets with a sample size of 10 participants. For the feeling depressed outcome, the COVID onset X neuroticism effect was significant in 66.5% of the 1,000 simulated datasets with a sample size of 10 participants. Longitudinal community-level psychological well-being with the 95% CI included. Any weeks in which the black circle markers are above this dashed line indicate community scores which were higher in 2020 relative to 2019, and those weeks below the dashed line indicate community scores which were lower in 2020 than 2019. Community anxiety scores and the 95% CI were higher in 2020 relative to 2019 for 11 of 19 EMAaligned weeks (58%) examined (see Fig 3) , community depressivity scores and the 95% CI were higher for 8 of 19 EMA-aligned weeks (42%) in 2020 (Fig 4) , and community affect scores and the 95% CI were more negatively-valenced for 14 of 19 EMA-aligned weeks (74%) in 2020 (Fig 5) . COVID-19 topic word clouds were overlaid on these panels so that the frequently used words or phrases in Tweets could be explored to illuminate events or aspects of the pandemic period that may have contributed to increases in community anxiety, depressivity, or affect valence. \n",
            " Individual-level EMA data were aggregated for each week in 2019 and 2020 for which data were available and aligned with community-level data. The correlation between the individual-level data on three outcomes (tense/anxious, depressed, and mood valence) and the corresponding community-level data on each of these outcomes (linguistic anxiety, linguistic depressivity, and linguistic affect) were calculated for 2019 and 2020. \n",
            " This study presents a novel approach of contextualizing longitudinal changes in psychological well-being during the early COVID-19 pandemic by integrating individual-level EMA data with community-level indicators. At the individual-level, we found within-person increases in loneliness from 2019 to 2020 among EAS older adult participants. We also found that participants higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism showed more within-person increases from 2019 to 2020 in momentary thought unpleasantness and feeling depressed. At the community-level, language analysis of Tweets from Bronx County where EAS participants resided showed declines in well-being. Specifically, higher anxiety and depressivity and more negatively valenced affect were observed in community Tweets in the majority of 2020 weeks relative to the same 2019 weeks. Finally, the topics revealed in word clouds derived from Twitter were also used to elucidate the week-to-week fluctuations observed in both the individual-level and the surrounding community across 2019 and 2020. These topics both support the interpretation of pandemic-related threats to well-being at both individual and community levels, as well as other major disruptions that occurred during 2020.\n",
            " It is important to consider that although the early pandemic period is likely a new exemplar for the classic developmental definitions of a shared history-graded influence [45] , it did not impact all individuals in the same way. Indeed, multilevel models of individual-level data fit better when individual differences in the patterns of change from 2019 to 2020 were allowed and neuroticism emerged as a significant moderator of change. Considering the goal of identifying generalizable patterns in research, this study's results suggest caution in this pursuitpatterns of the pandemic's impact on psychological well-being are expected to differ across communities (and samples), unfolding at different times and with different triggers driven by local conditions. The community-level data showed varying levels of anxiety, depressivity, and negative affect (relative to average levels) across weeks and the word clouds representing common topics posted on Twitter provide insight into the different events that may have caused the fluctuating levels of community-level psychological well-being. Some of the largest differences between 2020 and 2019 observed in the community-level markers of depressivity and negatively-valenced affect occurred in early June 2020. Selected word clouds for this week highlight new topics (e.g., racism, protests, #blacklivesmatter), which did not appear as common topics earlier in 2020 and corresponded to major non-COVID events such as the murder of George Floyd and the incident in which a white woman called the police on a Black man birdwatching [46, 47] . Sampling from a single week or aggregating across communities and weeks would likely have missed this important nuance. The use of Twitter demonstrated an approach for using auxiliary data to improve understanding of the social environment within a geographic area in psychological survey research without increasing burden on participants.\n",
            " Despite the lack of significant correlations between weekly scores, results shown in Figs 6-8 highlight the week-to-week variability and different patterns across psychological well-being measures between EAS participants and their surrounding community environment. For example, community and individual depressivity scores during the weeks of March and early-April 2020 appear to be tightly coupled and covary across these weeks (see Fig 7) which corresponds to the period when COVID-19-related cases, hospitalizations, and deaths peaked in New York City [48] . The variability across weeks in 2020 among both individual-level and community-level scores highlight the heterogeneity of the early pandemic period. Future studies that analyze data collected during 2020, but do not attend to date or location of data collection, may be influenced by an increasing mix of other significant and stressful events in an especially eventful year (e.g., changes in COVID-19 rates and related restrictions, protests, presidential election), with some locations and communities likely to be affected more by these events as well. For example, because the EAS sample includes only older adults, participants' psychological well-being may not have been as tightly tied to community changes in services impacting age-relevant roles, such as school closures and childcare which may have been picked up in Twitter [1, 49] . Considering the local conditions during the early pandemic period (e.g., COVID-19 case count, stay-at-home orders) provides relevant context for understanding data collected on individuals. With few exceptions [50, 51] , most psychological studies have not considered the local conditions to contextualize individual-level data.\n",
            " Individual-level data were limited to individuals over age 70 residing in a single county and community-level data were drawn from Twitter users from the same county, during the same time periods. Although these narrowly focused datasets and time periods may limit our findings' generalizability, these choices were made to enhance validity by cleanly aligning individuals with their community in real-time. As mentioned above, demographics and community context likely influenced how individuals experienced the early pandemic, and thus it is valuable to examine targeted groups whose experiences may not match those that would be concluded from studies that group an entire population together as a whole. In illustration of this concept, the age of our participants may help explain why more widespread changes in psychological well-being from 2019 to 2020 did not emerge in our study, considering previous findings that older adults have experienced less severe impairments of their psychological wellbeing due to COVID [10, 11] . Even with our targeted time scope, though, we dichotomized time into \"pre-pandemic\" (2019) and \"pandemic\" (2020) periods, thus treating the pandemic period as uniform and not further differentiating how the impacts of COVID-19 may have changed within this period. In future work, we will use the Twitter-based indicators as timevarying predictors, allowing us to model the effects of changing community distress on individual outcomes. Future research assessing the disruptive effects of the pandemic and other history-graded influences should consider how these effects differ across time and space and how they interact with other concurrent societal events.\n",
            " Research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being should consider the time and place of data collection. This study showed that from February to June of 2020, community levels of anxiety, depressivity, and negative affect fluctuated from week to week, suggesting that this period should not be considered homogenous. Further analysis of longitudinal reports of momentary psychological well-being collected from older adults living in Bronx County before and during the pandemic suggest increases in loneliness and poorer general psychological well-being specifically among individuals higher in neuroticism during the pandemic. Future work should consider critical community-level variables around current events such as case count, policies to prevent the spread of cases, and available information regarding risk in addition to community emotion levels. Additionally, the impact of social events such as protests of police killings and the U.S. presidential election that occurred during 2020 should also be considered. Together, the findings from individual-level and communitylevel data present an in-depth assessment of older adults' psychological well-being within a specific community during the early months of the pandemic, while being mindful of individuals' temporal, spatial, and social contexts.\n",
            " included in the study period. Note. EAS = Einstein Aging Study. Counts of Twitter users and EAS participants are presented for 2019 and 2020. The data were aligned at the respective weeks for 2019 and 2020 which do not correspond to the exact same dates in each year. The dates displayed on the x-axis represent the midpoint of the week in 2020. In Panel B, individual EAS participants completed EMA surveys across multiple weeks and therefore are included in the bars across multiple weeks meaning the sum of these bars exceeds the number of EAS participants (N = 78). Two participants' data are not depicted in this graph because one participant completed their pre-COVID EMA burst in December 2018, another in October 2019. These participants' observations, however, were included in the analyses of individual-level data. In the EMA portion of the results for this manuscript, we limited our 2020 time window to data completed during the week of June 13, 2020. Thus, the orange bars in panel B do not continue past the week of June 13. The x-axis extends beyond the 2020 data used in our analyses to show the EMA 2019 data collection, as well as to mirror the x-axis in the Twitter data. (TIF) S1 Table. Full multilevel model results. Results of separate parallel two-level multilevel models are shown. A total of 7,329 observations from 78 participants were collected in 2019 and a total of 7,204 observations from 78 participants were collected in 2020. One participant did not complete the personality measures and thus these 197 observations were excluded from these models. The number of observations used in each model differs because each outcome was assessed at different frequencies. Thought unpleasantness and stress were assessed 6 times per day and thought control, worry, tense/anxious, lonely, depressed, and frustrated were assessed 5 times per day. (DOCX)\n"

            "Title: Assessing the genetic component of the susceptibility of mice to viral infections\n",
            "Body Text: The severity and outcome of viral infections may be influenced by a number of factors. Some of these factors, for example the age of the host, its physiological status or previous infections with similar infectious agents, are environmental by nature. Other factors, by contrast, depend on the genetic constitution of both the host and the infectious agent, and it is for this reason that the encounters between the two organisms have sometimes been compared with the 'battle' of two genomes. 1 Indeed, co-evolution of viruses with their hosts towards less deleterious infections must be advantageous for both organisms, since any viral disease leading ruthlessly and regularly to the death of the host would also lead to the disappearance of the virus. Such situations may have occurred during evolution but, of course, there are no clues to substantiate this assumption.\n",
            " In the human species, several observations of inherited resistance (or susceptibility) to specific pathogens have been reported. Resistance to malarial infection was one of the first examples, while resistance to HIV infection is one of the most recent. In both cases, the observation led to the discovery of a single Mendelian locus: the sickle-cell trait in the first case (HbS), the gene encoding the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the latter. 2, 3 There have also been reports of other cases of resistance or susceptibility to infectious microorganisms that were controlled by single Mendelian units. In most instances, however, the observed differences have a more complex determinism, with several genes or quantitative trait loci being involved, reflecting the complexity of the host/virus interactions. 4 Using the mouse as a model species for investigating the genetic component of susceptibility to viral infections is advantageous because it is possible to test homogeneous populations (inbred strains) using different routes of inoculation and various doses or strains of virus. In addition, once a genetic difference has been observed between any two strains, the genes that are involved in determining this phenotype are amenable to molecular analysis. Finally, another advantage of the mouse species is that any gene that is suspected a priori to play a role in the pathophysiology of cellular infection may be modified by in vitro genetic engineering for further analysis. For all of these reasons, and despite the fact that viruses that are pathogenic to mice are not always pathogenic to man, it has been possible over the past few decades to identify a number of host cellular genes modifying the susceptibility of mammalian cells to particular viruses. [5] [6] [7] These genes, in general, act at one of three discrete steps of viral infection: 1) when the virus binds to the cell surface or when it enters the cell; 2) during the early phases of replication, interfering with the so-called innate mechanisms of immunity; or 3) during the later phases of virus production. This review will consider the cases in which genetic analysis of interstrain differences have allowed the identification of discrete loci with a major influence on susceptibility to experimental viral infections, with emphasis on those cases that have been investigated up to the molecular level by the strategy of forward genetics.\n",
            " Flaviviruses are positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses which are generally transmitted by arthropod bites (mosquitoes or ticks). In most cases, infections caused by these viruses are mild or even unapparent, indicating that some degree of adaptation between the virus and its host has occurred. In some regions, however, mosquito-borne flaviviruses can cause epidemic outbreaks in humans, and infected patients may exhibit a wide range of symptoms, ranging from transient febrile illness to life-threatening haemorrhagic fevers (dengue and yellow fever) or meningo-encephalitis syndromes (Japanese encephalitis and West Nile fever). The reasons why flaviviruses cause severe clinical manifestations only in a small percentage of infected individuals have not yet been elucidated, but recurrent epidemiological observations and recent scientific data indicate that host-dependent genetic factors might be important. Variations in mouse innate flavivirus susceptibility were reported for the first time in the early 1930s. Investigations performed during the following decades indicated that a major locus on chromosome (Chr) 5, designated flavivirus resistance (Flv), was responsible for the observed phenotype with, basically, two alleles: Flv r , which is dominant and induces resistance and Flv s , which is recessive and correlates with susceptibility. For historical details on the discovery and genetics of the Flv locus, refer to Shellam et al. (1998) or Brinton and Perelygin (2003) . 8, 9 Surprisingly, most (not to say all) laboratory-inbred strains of mice are susceptible to experimental infections, while most wild mice are resistant. To mention just one example of this dramatic difference in susceptibility, the author's group reported that a single intraperitoneal inoculation equivalent to 100 LD 50 laboratory inbred strains BALB/c and C57BL/6, was lethal for all of these animals 9.5AE1.5 days after inoculation, while mice from totally unrelated inbred strains recently derived from wild ancestors of either the Mus m. domesticus (WMP/Pas), Mus m. musculus (MAI/Pas, MBT/Pas, PWK/Pas) or Mus spretus (SEG/Pas, STF/Pas) species, or from laboratory strain PL/J, were resistant to the same treatment. 10 During this experiment, infectious particles of WN virus could be detected in the brains of infected mice after five days of infection, and the amounts of virus peaked at 10 9 focus forming units/g of brain tissue by day 7. High levels of anti-WN antibody could also be detected in surviving animals, indicating that the virus replicated in resistant strains. This study was no more than a recapitulation of the many similar experiments that had been carried out over the previous 40 years, with a variety of flaviviruses using several routes of inoculation and several doses and strains of virus. 8, 9 All of these experiments yielded similar results, confirming that the phenotype of resistance/susceptibility is not WNspecific but, on the contrary, extends to other types of flaviviruses as well. It is now established that the phenotype of resistance/susceptibility co-segregates with a point mutation in the gene Oas1b, encoding the 1B isoform of 29-59 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS1B). 10, 11 Although the Oas1b gene exhibits several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the different strains or species of mice, it is remarkable that all susceptible mice tested so far have a T!C transition that replaces an arginine residue with a premature stop codon in the fourth exon of the gene. The perfect correlation between susceptibility to viral infection and the occurrence of a stop codon supports the hypothesis that a truncated, and presumably inactive, form of 29-59 OAS L1 is indeed the cause of the innate susceptibility to flavivirus infection. The presence of a stop codon is also compatible with susceptibility behaving as a recessive trait and fits perfectly with one of the known functions of the interferoninducible enzyme 29-59 OAS, which is to synthesise 29-59 oligoadenylates which in turn activate latent ribonuclease L (RNase L), ultimately resulting in degradation of viral RNA and inhibition of viral replication. 12 In vitro experiments, performed with stable neuroblastoma cell clones overexpressing either the mutant or wildtype OAS1B, indicated that replication of the WN virus is less efficient in cells that produce the normal copy of OAS1B than in those expressing the mutant form of the protein, reinforcing the idea that the OAS1B gene is critical for controlling viral pathogenesis. 13 The structural organisation of the genes encoding 29-59 OASs has been studied in a few species, and in detail in humans and mice. In humans, it is a cluster of three genes designated OAS2, OAS3 and OAS1, respectively ( Figure 1 ). [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Human OAS2 and OAS3 have mouse orthologues in Oas2 and Oas3, and the transcription products of these genes are also very similar, with two alternatively spliced isoforms encoded in mouse Oas2, consistent with the existence of human isoforms p69 and p71 encoded in human OAS2, while -similar to the case in humans -there is only one transcript from mouse Oas3. The function of the proteins encoded in OAS2/Oas2 and OAS3/Oas3 is not yet clearly established. The structural organisation of OAS1 is very different in humans and in the mouse. In humans, there is only one OAS1 gene encoding four different OAS proteins (p42, p44, p46 and p48), resulting from an alternative splicing of the first five exons with the three exons of the C-terminal region ( Figure 2 ). In the mouse there are no less than eight transcription units, orthologous with the human OAS1 gene and arranged in tandem in the following order: Oas1e, Oas1c, Oas1b, Oas1f, Oas1h, Oas1g, Oas1a and Oas1d. For all of these eight genes, a specific interferon inducible promoter regulates transcription. So far only Oas1a has been found to be alternatively spliced yielding two transcripts each including different parts of exon 6. [19] [20] [21] [22] LXXXPA motif is a domain of 9 amino acids at the Cterminus of the protein which is essential for enzymatic activity. CFK motif is essential for tetramerisation of the molecule.\n",
            " Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences for the proteins encoded by the eight Oas1 genes indicates that Oas1c, Oas1d, Oas1e, Oas1f and Oas1h are structurally very similar and lack functional domains, such as the LXXXPA motif, the highly conserved aspartic acid residues in exon 2 and the CFK motif. 23 These observations suggest that, if these isoforms have retained their binding activity to double-stranded RNA, they have lost their Mg 2þ -dependent catalytic activity and, accordingly, may actually be inactive pseudogenes. [23] [24] [25] By contrast, Oas1g and Oas1a encode proteins that could be functional in the 29-59 OAS/ RNaseL cascade.\n",
            " The case of Oas1b is probably the most interesting of all, since, according to Perelygin and colleagues, the flavivirusspecific activity of the Oas1b isoform on viral replication might be correlated with a four-amino acid deletion in the P-loop motif that is unique to this isoform and which does not appear to exist in either rat or human. 11 This four-amino acid deletion may allow the Oas1b protein to recognise and bind a specific conserved RNA structure unique to flavivirus RNAs. Even though this hypothesis is supported by other experiments in vitro, 26 an alternative explanation to Oas1bspecific activity on flavivirus replication may also be found in its promoter sequence, where several binding sites (nuclear factor-k B, gamma-interferon activation site [GAS] and interferon-alpha stimulated response element [ISRE]) exhibit a unique organisation. In particular, it is noteworthy that Oas1b is the only gene for which the two binding sites, nuclear factor-kB and ISRE, are closely associated in tandem, producing a genomic structure that has previously been reported as being capable of triggering gene expression upon viral induction. 27 Sequencing the promoter regions of the Oas1b isoform in remotely related mouse species did not provide evidence that a particular structural change in this promoter might be associated with the phenotype of Figure 1 : Schematic representation of the organisation of the human and murine clusters of genes encoding 29-59 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS). The picture is not drawn to scale but is correctly orientated with respect to the centromeres for each species. All of these genes are transcribed and the direction of transcription is represented by arrows. Most of the mouse genes are probably pseudogenes, encoding proteins whose function is unknown but are probably not involved in the innate defence mechanisms against viral infections. (From Mashimo et al. 10 and reprinted with permission from Elsevier.)\n",
            " NFk kB, GAS and ISRE are acronyms that designate DNA binding sites in the promoter region of the gene. Due to a non-sense mutation in exon 4, the Oas1b/L1 isoform is translated in a truncated form in most mouse laboratory strains, but not in wild mice. Except for Oas1a, the mouse specific isoforms of Oas1 are not alternatively spliced. For isoforms OAS2/Oas2 and OAS3/ Oas3, the splicing process is the same in both species. The human 29-59 OAS transcripts are referenced according to Justesen et al. 17 and Rebouillat et al. 18 (From Mashimo et al. 10 and reprinted with permission from Elsevier.) resistance or susceptibility after flavivirus infection. This substantiates the hypothesis that the stop codon found in the Oas1b coding sequence of most laboratory strains is directly related to this phenotype. 10 Infections agents, especially when they are transmitted by arthropods, are not a threat to laboratory animals Situations in which mammalian genomes harbour orthologous genes in variable copy numbers are not uncommon. Olfactory receptors, for example, are also arranged in clusters and are at least three times more numerous in the mouse than in the man. 28 It was suggested that these variations were the result of different selective environmental pressures experienced by the ancestors of modern rodents and primates. Finally, and again concerning the Oas1b isoform, a likely hypothesis to account for the presence of the same stop codon in virtually all laboratory strains is that all of these strains inherited the same segment of Chr 5 from a common ancestor. Such a situation is not uncommon among mouse laboratory strains and was also observed by Staeheli and colleagues when, as is discussed below, they elucidated the genetic basis of susceptibility to orthomyxovirus infection. 29 Whether this occurred by chance only or under some sort of selective pressure, however, is an open question.\n",
            " Two very interesting observations concerning the genetic control of human susceptibility to flavivirus infections have been published recently. The first, by Bonnevie-Nielsen and colleagues, reports a significant correlation between the basal activity for OAS1 and an A/G SNP at the exon 7 splice-acceptor site (AG or AA) of the OAS1 gene. 30 According to those authors, in a cohort of 83 families, each containing two parents and two children, allele G had a higher frequency in people with high enzyme activity than in those with low enzyme activity, with the activity being related to this polymorphism in a dose-dependent manner across the GG, GA and AA genotypes. Allele G generates the p46 enzyme isoform, whereas allele A ablates the splice site and generates a dual-function antiviral/proapoptotic p48 isoform and a novel p52 isoform. The discovery of this genetic polymorphism and of its influence on host susceptibility to flavivirus infections underlines the likely importance of OAS1 in innate mechanisms of defence. Further experiments with mice should now be designed to confirm this interesting hypothesis.\n",
            " Another epidemiological survey reported by Sakuntabhai and colleagues indicates that polymorphisms at the CD209 gene, which encodes a C-type lectin differentially expressed by CD8alpha splenic dendritic cells and which is an attachment receptor for the dengue virus, probably also plays a crucial role in the severity of dengue pathogenesis. Dermal/interstitial myeloid dendritic cells constitute the first line of the innate host's defence against pathogens at the anatomical sites where it replicates after the initial bite by the infected mosquito. Consistent with this notion, it has recently been demonstrated that a promoter variant of CD209 (DC-SIGN1-336) has a functional role in the transcriptional regulation of CD209 and confers strong protection against dengue fever but not against dengue haemorrhagic fever. 31 Engineering mutations in the orthologous mouse gene should also be interesting to test this hypothesis.\n",
            " The phenotype of innate resistance or susceptibility of mice to flavivirus experimental infections described above was the first example demonstrated to have simple Mendelian inheritance. The phenotype of resistance/susceptibility towards orthomyxoviruses, infections which will now be considered, is the most extensively documented and the first for which the genes responsible have been characterised at the molecular level. 32 When challenged with mouse-adapted strains of influenza virus, for example when injected intracerebrally with the neurotropic avian influenza A strain or injected intranasally with a human pneumotropic strain, most laboratory inbred mouse strains die, while mice of strain A2G and most wild-derived inbred strains resist. [33] [34] [35] This phenotype is controlled by a genetic region on chromosome 16 with two closely linked genes, Mx1 and Mx2. 36 Mx1 has three alleles: Mx1 þ , the wild-type allele, which is dominant and confers resistance; and two recessive alleles (Mx1 À ), both resulting in susceptibility. The mouse Mx1 gene encodes a 72 kDa nuclear protein of the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases, whose transcription is induced by interferon shortly after infection. 29 In Mx1 À /Mx1 À mice, the protein is either absent because several exons of the gene are deleted (strain BALB/c, for example), or non-functional because it carries a nonsense mutation (strain CBA, for example). 37 Here again, the mutant, nonfunctional alleles of Mx1 are overrepresented in laboratory strains but are uncommon in wild mice. It is a good fortune that strain A2G, which was developed from 'illegitimate offspring' of strain A with wild mice, was used in early experiments; otherwise the discovery of the function of MX1, the Mx1 encoded protein, would probably have been delayed. It is also interesting to note that the phenotype of resistance/susceptibility of wild mice towards viruses of the influenza group was discovered in rather artificial conditions, since mice are not natural hosts for that sort of 'airborne' virus. For this reason, it was suggested that the Mx1 system may serve an important purpose against other pathogens of the same orthomyxovirus class or against pathogens of related classes. Moreover, it was demonstrated some years later that influenza-like arboviruses, such as the Thogoto virus, the Dhori virus or the Batken virus -which are common pathogens for wild mice -were also able to trigger the Mx-mediated innate mechanism of defence. [38] [39] [40] Wild mice resist experimental infections with these viruses, whereas laboratory mice do not.\n",
            " The closely linked Mx2 gene, which is only a few kilobases apart from the Mx1 locus, is also non-functional in all laboratory mouse strains examined so far because of an insertional mutation in its coding sequence generating a frame shift and premature termination. 32 As mentioned above, the MX protein product of the Mx1 gene is not normally synthesised in resting cells but is induced after interferon-alpha or -beta (but not -gamma) stimulation in macrophages. Unlike 29-59 OAS, the MX protein is a nuclear protein whose function is to impede virus replication. Several experiments have clearly demonstrated that the lack of MX1 protein in laboratory mice could be restored by transgenesis with a normal copy of the wild-type Mx1 allele or the orthologous copy of another species -rat or man, for example. [41] [42] [43] The Mx2 gene of the feral strains encodes a protein comprising 656 amino acids, which is also expressed following interferon treatment and localises to the cytoplasm. It has been demonstrated that this protein inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus replication.\n",
            " Similar to 29-59 OAS, MX proteins exhibit considerable sequence preservation among most mammalian species, including man. The structure of these proteins has been extensively studied and they have been found to consist essentially of two main domains: an N-terminal domain, which is shared with several other GTP-binding proteins, and a C-terminal domain with two extremely important leucine-zipper motifs, which are essential for proteinprotein binding. 44, 45 Mutations in either of these two domains usually result in loss of activity for the MX protein.\n",
            " Interestingly, it was demonstrated that some amino acid substitutions can only partially affect the activity of the protein, making it unable to prevent the replication of some, but not all, representatives of the orthomyxovirus family. 46, 47 Interspecific variations in the antiviral specificity of the MX protein is It is likely that many genes cooperate to make a mouse resistant to a particular infection, but these genes can be identified only when they have a mutant non-functional allele often explained by some discrete polymorphisms at the sequence level.\n",
            " The MX protein encoded by the MXA orthologous gene of human cells shows a high degree of sequence similarity with MX2; it also accumulates in the cytoplasm of interferon-treated cells, associating with the endoplasmic reticulum. Unlike MX1, however, it inhibits a limited range of RNA viruses. It was demonstrated, for example, that transgenic mice that permanently express the human MXA protein became resistant to infection with Thogoto virus but remained susceptible to Dhori virus. 48 This difference in specificity was precisely attributed to a polymorphism in the coding sequence. These results indicate that the Mx1/Mx2 system is a powerful defence mechanism against tick-borne influenza viruses in mice, although MX1 and human MXA GTPases are also active against some other negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses such as bunyaviruses (Rift Valley virus, La Crosse virus, Crimea Congo virus, etc). 49 In the case of bunyaviruses, confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate that MXA co-localises with the nucleocapsid protein of the viruses in the perinuclear regions of infected cells, preventing the transport of this protein to the Golgi compartment, the site of virus assembly. In the case of Thogoto virus, meanwhile, MXA prevents the incoming viral nucleocapsids from being transported into the nucleus, the site of viral transcription and replication. 49 \n",
            " Coronaviruses represent a large family of positive-sense and single-stranded RNA viruses. These viruses infect mostly epithelial cells of a wide range of vertebrates, including mice, rats, pigs, cattle, birds and humans. (The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in South-East Asia is still fresh in our memories). In humans, enteric infections can also occur in young infants and neurological syndromes have also been reported. Coronaviruses represent a major threat for laboratory animal (mice in particular) breeders, with murine hepatitis virus (MHV) being by far the most frequent pathogen in breeding colonies, although the situation has improved over recent years due to better diagnostic and prophylactic measures.\n",
            " MHV, like other RNA viruses, mutates rapidly and frequently recombines with other coronaviruses of the same group. This results in the generation of a great variety of strains with various degrees of pathogenicity. Among all these strains, the best studied are MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, JHM, A/ 59 and S, of which MHV-3 is regarded as the most aggressive. 50 Some strains have a primary tropism for the upper respiratory tract and others for the enteric mucosa and liver. 51 Mice of all strains and ages are susceptible to experimental infections, but the severity of the clinical symptoms that ensue greatly depends on the genetics of the virus and of the infected strain. Investigations have been undertaken in several laboratories to unravel the genetic determinism of this trait, and two loci have been reported to be of importance: Hv1 (formerly Hv) and Hv2 (now designated Ceacam1). Hv1 has two alleles: Hv1 r , which occurs in strain C3H/An and determines resistance to viruses of the MHV-2 group; and Hv1 s which determines susceptibility and is found in strain PRI. Heterozygotes are susceptible. The cellular basis for this phenotype seems to be at the level of macrophages, in which the virus fails to replicate in resistant mice. The molecular basis of this difference is not known and the locus has not even been positioned on the mouse genetic map. It is known, however, that it is neither linked to the Oas1 locus on chromosome 5 nor to Hv2, the other locus for MHV resistance. 52 Hv2, now designated Ceacam1, is more interesting. It was discovered after challenging mice of various inbred strains with viruses of strains JHM or A59. 53, 54 Strain SJL carries the resistant allele Hv2 r (now known as Ceacam1 b ), while most other inbred strains are homozygous for the susceptible allele (Hv2 s , now Sequence variations in homologous genes of different species parallel the evolution of infectious agents. It is an illustration of the 'battle' of two genomes. Ceacam1 a ). The Hv2 locus maps to Chr 7. 55, 56 After a series of elegant experiments, the molecular basis of the phenotype determining susceptibility has now been totally elucidated. The receptor for MHV, designated CEACAM1, is a glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily and of the carcinoembryonic family of cell adhesion molecules. This molecule is abundant on the intestinal brush border membranes of the colon and small intestine and also on liver cell membranes -two cell types which are the principal targets for MHV replication. 57 This receptor has been isolated by immunoprecipitation and has been extensively studied. 58 It has been demonstrated that it binds specifically to the spikes that are on the envelope (on the corona) of the MHV virus, allowing entry of the virus into the cells. Mice of the inbred SJL strain synthesise an alloform of the glycoprotein (CEACAM1b) which differs from the homologous glycoprotein of the other strains (CEACAM1a) by 27 of the 108 amino acids of the N domain (D1), and this is sufficient to hamper viral integration (and of course replication) into the intestinal and hepatic cells. SJL mice are resistant to 10,0003 the normally lethal dose of MHV-A59. 54 In addition to the murine coronavirus MHV, mouse CEACAM1a protein and its human orthologue are targets of bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis, as well as Moraxella catarrhalis in humans. Human coronaviruses, however, do not bind to this molecule.\n",
            " Mice with a genetically engineered null allele at the Ceacam1 locus (Ceacam1 -=-) have been produced. It has been demonstrated that these mice are fully resistant to MHV-A59 infections by both intranasal and intracerebral routes: 59 after an experimental infection, virus was recovered from the liver and spinal cord tissues of normal C57BL/6 mice but not of mice homozygous for the knockout allele. These results indicate that CEACAM1a is the sole receptor for MHV-A59 in both liver and brain, and rules out the possible existence of another receptor for the virus as previously postulated. 60, 61 This result is also particularly interesting since it is the first time that a genetically engineered mammalian species has been shown to become resistant to a viral infection and exhibit no other deleterious effects. This, of course, might have considerable economic impact if it could be applied to other species.\n",
            " Herpesviruses represent a large and rather heterogeneous family of enveloped DNA viruses which are a leading cause of diseases in humans, second after influenza viruses. Herpesviruses cause either overt diseases, like varicella or chicken pox, or can remain silent for many years, being reactivated only on certain circumstances, for example as shingles. In the mouse, herpesvirus infections are less common than in humans and apparently only two members of this family can infect spontaneously: MCMV-1, also described as murid herpesvirus 1 (MuHV-1), and the murid herpesvirus 3 or MuHV-3, sometimes described as mouse thymic virus. 50 Only MCMV-1 is interesting in the context of this review because very little is known concerning the pathology of MuHV-3, which seems to be rare and is extremely difficult to grow in vitro.\n",
            " Spontaneous infections of mice by MCMV-1 result in subclinical salivary gland infections in which the virus persists for a very long time, possibly for the duration of the animal's life. In this sense, the infection of mice with MCMV-1 mimics human infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), which is sexually transmitted and remains almost unapparent, but which can become a serious health problem in patients who are immunodepressed after organ transplantation or if suffering from AIDS.\n",
            " Experimental infections of mice not previously infected (ie with a specific Because the infectious agents are sometimes very different, laboratory animals are not always good models for investigating the physiopathology of infectious diseases in humans patrogen free [SPF] standard) with MCMV-1 can result in the death of the animal or in major symptomatology, depending on the age of the mouse, the strain to which it belongs, the route of inoculation and the dose and strain of virus inoculated. 62 Variations in susceptibility of the different strains of experimentally infected mice have been reported and a major role was initially attributed to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) H2, with strains with an H2 b or H2 d haplotype at the MHC being ten times less resistant than strains with an H2 k haplotype. 63 Recombinant inbred strains are inbred strains bred from F1 hybrids between two unrelated parental strains. The genome of these strains is homozygous for 50 per cent of each of the parental alleles.\n",
            " Scalzo and colleagues, re-investigating the genetic basis for the control of acute splenic replication after inoculation of MCMV virus into mice of strain C57BL/ 6 (resistant) and BALB/c (susceptible), and using a set of recombinant inbred strains derived from these two parental strains, demonstrated the importance of an autosomal dominant non-H2 gene, Cmv1, with a probable location on Chr 6. 64 The location of the Cmv1 locus on Chr 6 was confirmed and refined by several authors, and it was demonstrated that the phenotype of resistance/ susceptibility was correlated with the activity of natural killer (NK) cells against MCMV-1-infected cells. [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] Positional cloning of the Cmv1 locus revealed that the phenotype was associated with structural variations in a cluster of genes -members of the killer cell lectin-like receptor family a (Klra), encoding inhibitory or activating NK cell receptors that interact with MHC class 1 molecules in promoting cytolysis of infected cells. 70 The observation that the recombinant inbred strain BXD-8/Ty, with a Cmv1 r haplotype derived from strain C57BL/6, was nonetheless highly susceptible to MCMV-1 infection, was explained by the discovery of a deletion of the Klra8 gene, pointing to the specific importance of this gene. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, Brown and colleagues demonstrated that the Ly49H was absent in mice of the BXD-8 strain and, moreover, that treatment with an anti-Ly49H monoclonal antibody prior to MCMV infection abrogated MCMV resistance in mice of the C57BL/6 inbred strain. 71 This suspicion was confirmed by producing 'resistant' transgenic mice expressing a functional KLRA8 (formerly Ly49H) in an otherwise susceptible genetic background. 72 The innate defence mechanism operating against MCMV-1 is now well understood: the resistant allele at the Klra8 locus encodes a membrane receptor capable of binding to a viral product called m157, which is an MHC class I-like protein expressed at the surface of all infected cells, and the m157-KLRA8 interaction triggers the cytolytic machinery of NK cells and the production of interferon-ª. 73, 74 Infected mice are then protected by both the killing of infected cells and the production of interferon. The Klra8 locus provides the first example of an NK receptor that is able to mediate clearance of viral infection via direct recognition of a virally encoded protein. 75 Two interesting observations on this mechanism of defence were published recently. The first, by French and co-workers, indicates that more aggressive mutant viruses can emerge under the selective pressure of innate immunity as it operates in the case of herpesviruses. 76 This, of course, raises a serious issue, since mutant viruses may also occur in human patients and cause death. The second observation originates from Vidal's laboratory at McGill University, from which a great deal of current knowledge about innate immunity to MCMV-1 has been acquired, and indicates that the NK cell mechanism implicated in resistance depends on the functional interaction of the Ly49P receptor with the MHC class I molecule H-2D(k) on MCMV-infected cells. 77 The first observations on the role of H2 genes have thus been confirmed and elegantly interpreted.\n",
            " Retroviruses are special types of RNA virus because, after infection of permissive mammalian cells, they are retrotranscribed as proviruses and integrate into the mammalian genome, where they stay forever. In general, there are three types of retrovirus: the oncoviruses, whose genes are transcribed in oncogenic molecules; the spumaviruses, which are responsible for weak or inapparent infections in many mammalian species; and the lentiviruses, of which HIV1 and HIV2 as the most famous examples, are cytopathogenic. All three classes of retroviruses can infect mice and variations in the susceptibility of the different inbred strains have long been known. 78, 79 The Friend leukaemia virus and its many variants have been used extensively as models for studying the intimate mechanisms at work in the determinism of oncovirus susceptibility. From these studies, a number of cellular genes have been identified, either after pure in vitro approaches or because they existed in different allelic forms in the different laboratory strains. All of these genes (designated Fv1, Fv2, Fv4, Rmcf, etc) actively protect the cells from infection by different mechanisms, acting at different steps of the viral life cycle, and some of them have now been cloned. [80] [81] [82] All of these results have been presented in detail in several excellent reviews, so will not be further discussed here. 7, [83] [84] [85] [86] It is, however, important to understand that research on the susceptibility of mouse cells to adapted retroviruses may have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to inhibit other retroviral infections, including those by the lentiviruses HIV1 and HIV2.\n",
            " Several other cases where different strains of laboratory mice exhibit different degrees of susceptibility when experimentally infected have been studied. So far, however, knowledge of these genes has not reached a level of resolution leading to the molecular characterisation of gene products.\n",
            " Among the most documented cases in which there is a strong influence of host genetics are infections with Theiler's virus. This picornavirus, which is very common in wild mice and is an occasional contaminant of laboratory animal colonies, causes persistent and demyelinating infections of the central nervous system, and this syndrome is considered to be one of the best models of human multiple sclerosis. The virus infects neurones for a few weeks and then shifts to white matter, where it persists in glial cells and macrophages. Susceptibility to persistent infection varies among inbred strains and is multigenic, with a major effect of H2 class I genes. Other non-H2 susceptibility loci have been identified, but so far none have been cloned. 87, 88 Tmevp1 and Tmevp3 are two of these non-H2 genes that appear to regulate the expression of important cytokines. 89 Another example is provided by the Sindbis virus, an alphavirus. Based on the observation that BALB/c mice are resistant while C57BL/6 are susceptible, a gene (neuro-adapted Sindbis virus 1 [Nsv1]) which controls early viral load and determines the likelihood of paralysis and death has been discovered and mapped to Chr 2, but here again the molecular nature of the protein encoded by this gene is not yet known. 90 Finally, a few other genes or genetic regions have been found to be of importance for the genetic control of susceptibility of mice to experimental infections with human herpes simplex virus 1. These genes have not even been precisely mapped. 91 \n",
            " This review has reported a small number of cases in which different strains of laboratory mice exhibit varying behaviour, with some of them being more resistant than others after experimental infection with several types of viruses. Using the classical strategy of forward genetics, often called positional cloning, a handful of loci have been identified at the molecular level and the gene products characterised. This has helped to explain why, for example, if the alloform of the CEACAM1 glycoprotein that appears at the surface of intestinal and liver cells of mice does not 'fit' perfectly with the viral ligand, entry of the coronavirus MHV into the cell is impeded and the mouse is not infected. This discovery had an immediate application, with the production of a resistant (and viable) transgenic mouse strain with no glycoprotein at all on its cell surface. Similar situations with other viruses and other species might be discovered in the future. Unfortunately, situations as simple and straightforward as that reported above will probably not be frequent. Viruses are highly host specific, and information gathered from experiments performed in mice with mouse viruses can only be considered as indications or 'targets' for investigations in other species. Human coronaviruses, for example, do not, apparently, bind to CEACAM1-like molecules. Another difficulty is that viruses often use functionally important molecules as receptors, which cannot be deleted or even altered without important sideeffects for the host cells. Modifying the cell receptor structure with the aim of altering the phenotype of susceptibility of a given species to viral infection will probably not reveal an easy way to go.\n",
            " The case of the OAS1 locus and its importance in the innate mechanism of defence against flavivirus infection is interesting for two reasons. First, the role of 29-59 OAS was discovered from observations made in mice, in which Oas1 exists in two versions: normal, or mutant and non-functional. This finding allowed epidemiologists to focus their attention on this gene, which led to the discovery that the region was critical for the severity of dengue in endemic regions, although a totally different alteration of the molecular structure of the gene was discovered to explain this. 30 It is likely that situations of this kind will also be found for other viruses. In fact, the genes reported here as examples (Flv, Mx1, Mx2, Cmv1, etc) were all discovered because they had a null allele, with dramatic phenotypic effects, segregating the different laboratory strains or wild specimens, but these are exceptions. It is likely that the genes that are involved in the organisation and function of the innate defence mechanisms are extremely numerous, with each of them having an additive effect. Moreover, for the vast majority of these genes, there is, as yet, no mutant, nor even a variant allele amenable to genetic analysis. Many of the transgenic strains that are generated worldwide appear to have an increased susceptibility to the viral infections sometimes occurring in laboratory facilities, irrespective of the nature of the transgene. This clearly indicates a high level of complexity and genetic integration.\n",
            " A final important point must be addressed in this review, concerning the polymorphism segregation among the laboratory mouse populations. Unlike human populations, laboratory mice are rather homogeneous because they are all derived from a limited number of ancestors stemming from different subspecies. 92 With an increasing use of strains recently derived from wild specimens of unrelated origin, it is likely that many more genes influencing susceptibility towards infectious agents will be discovered. Wild mice are constantly attacked by pathogens, including viruses, and, accordingly, they must constantly improve the specificity and efficiency of their innate mechanisms of defence. Furthermore, these mechanisms probably vary according to the geographical origin of the specimens. In the same way, the chemical mutagenesis or systematic genetrapping projects that are now in progress in several laboratories worldwide should also provide researchers with many interesting new mutant alleles. The problem in these cases would be to detect the interesting genotypes after challenging the offspring of mutagenised ancestors with appropriate tests. This will be the challenge for researchers.\n",

            "Body Text: Infectious diseases greatly impact human health, biodiversity, and global economies, highlighting the need to understand and predict their distributions.\n",
            " Ecological niche modeling (ENM) was not originally designed to explicitly reconstruct complex biological phenomena such as diseases or parasitism, requiring a reevaluation of the traditional framework.\n",
            " We provide an integrative ENM framework for disease systems that considers suitable host availability, parasite ecologies, and different scales of modeling.\n",
            " Disease transmission is driven by factors related to parasite availability and host exposure and susceptibility, which can be incorporated in ENM frameworks.\n",
            " A plethora of algorithms is available to perform ENM (e.g., MaxEnt, Regression Trees) and methods for the development of accurate models have been described at length (see [19, 20] for comparisons). Ecological interactions are hypothesized to affect species distributions only locally (i.e., the Eltonian noise hypothesis [10] ) and are usually considered irrelevant in traditional coarse-scale ENM applications [10, 21] . However, growing evidence suggests that biotic interactions may have a larger role in shaping broad-scale species distributions, especially under changing conditions (e.g., climate change) [10, [22] [23] [24] . For example, continental-scale distributions of the North American warbler are better explained when coupling biotic interactions (e.g., vegetation requirements) with abiotic factors (climate data) [23] . Biotic interactors can be included in ENM by incorporating interacting species as predictor variables (preprocessing), restricting the distribution of the focal species to regions where interactions may occur (post-processing), and linking demographic population models to the final ENM [10, [25] [26] [27] .\n",
            " The two most common disease distribution modeling methods are black-box and componentbased approaches (Table 1 ; [18] ). Black-box approaches model the overall geographic distribution of a final manifestation of host-parasite interactions (e.g., disease outbreaks), assuming that this outcome summarizes all biotic interactions involved in transmission [28] [29] [30] . This approach provides a pragmatic framework to generalize disease distributions and is useful when transmission dynamics are poorly understood and data are limited, which is frequently the case for EIDs [31] . However, the black-box oversimplification may be perilous as it neglects ecological complexity (e.g., the identity of key host species for transmission). Alternatively, component-based approaches consider the individual ecologies of all species involved in disease transmission (e.g., parasites, hosts) [16, 17, 32] . This approach allows the identification of host species and prioritization of areas for disease surveillance and control. Component-based approaches require in-depth knowledge of the disease system (e.g., the identity and ecologies of relevant species, transmission cycle), which may not be readily Glossary Allee effect: correlation between population size or density and the per capita growth rate (mean individual fitness) of a population. Basic reproductive number (R 0 ): expected number of secondary cases caused by a single infectious individual in a population. Biotic, abiotic, and movement (BAM) framework: simplified representation of a species' geographic distribution determined by the intersection of suitable abiotic conditions (A), biotic interactions (B), and the species' dispersal capacity (M). Bridge host: host population capable of facilitating transmission between two otherwise geographically disconnected maintenance and target populations. Coinfection: simultaneous infection of a host by multiple parasite species.\n",
            " Disease system: set of species, including parasites, susceptible hosts, and vectors, involved in the maintenance, transmission, and expression of a disease. Ecological niche modeling (ENM): computational method used to predict species geographic distributions by combining factors related to a species' environmental requirements with those related to occurrence and dispersal. Ecophylogenetics: field in biology that focuses on the study of ecological patterns in biological communities (e.g., community assembly, species co-occurrence) explained by the evolutionary relationships among coexisting species. Eltonian noise hypothesis: ecological hypothesis stating that local-scale ecological interactions have negligible effects on a species' geographic distribution. Emerging infectious disease (EID): diseases that have increased in incidence or geographic range, found in novel hosts or caused by newly evolved parasites. Exposure: likelihood of contact between a target population and hazards. The degree of exposure will depend on the contact rate, the parasite's transmission mechanism, and the nature of a contact event. available, especially for emerging diseases (e.g., Middle East respiratory syndrome) [18] .\n",
            " Obtaining the necessary information on disease systems can be labor intensive, time consuming, and economically unfeasible [18] . Choosing between these two approaches for disease distribution modeling should be done in accordance with the research question, data availability, and implicit assumptions [18, 22] .\n",
            " Data Quality and Availability A major challenge of the application of ENM to disease systems is the lack of reliable, highquality disease occurrence repositories. This has led to the widespread use of black-box modeling for disease outbreaks [28] [29] [30] and component-based modeling of hosts only [17, 32] . The use of outbreak data to model disease distributions raises methodological issues. Disease data are generally aggregated at coarse politicoadministrative levels (e.g., province, country), losing crucial information on the local natural history of the disease [1, 33] . Additionally, the geographic site of infection and the associated uncertainty are generally not reported and may instead refer to the health-care facility where it is diagnosed [1] , potentially misleading the identification of ecological conditions favoring disease occurrence. This could be further complicated by centralized health-care infrastructures and scarce epidemiological resources, resulting in predictions of the site of diagnosis instead of the site of infection and parasite persistence [34] . Lack of information on the ecology of a disease system may hinder proper identification of the parasite species (or strain in the case of viruses) causing the disease and/or the hosts involved in their transmission. This is particularly true for EIDs [31] , posing a significant challenge to the prediction of geographic distributions in an ENM framework.\n",
            " Host-Parasite Interactions At least two interacting speciesa parasite and a host [35, 36] are present in a disease system. These systems vary in complexity as some parasites can infect multiple hosts, potentially requiring the presence of keystone host species for their transmission (e.g., vectors) and maintenance (e.g., reservoir hosts). Here we define 'parasites' broadly to encompass all organisms capable of causing disease (i.e., pathogens), including microparasites (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa) and macroparasites (e.g., flatworms, nematodes). Similarly, we broadly define 'hosts' to include arthropod vectors and vertebrate reservoir hosts of parasites.\n",
            " Since biotic interactions lie at the core of disease systems, neglecting interacting species and their role in parasite dynamics (maintenance, reproduction, and transmission) may lead to failure to forecast disease distributions ( Figure 1 ). Parasite transmission is strongly influenced by interactions among infected and susceptible hosts, which can be altered by host behavior and demography [6, 37, 38] . For example, parasite transmission was found to be related to spider monkey (Ateles hybridus) grooming activity [39] and to aggregation behavior during hibernation in bat colonies of multiple species [40] .\n",
            " Transmission dynamics can be further altered by the structure of the ecological community [9, [41] [42] [43] [44] . For example, host species living at higher population densities with smaller body sizes and shorter generation spans were more likely to be competent reservoirs for multihost vector-borne diseases [37] . Likewise, host species diversity was found to alter transmission by decreasing host density (i.e., dilution effect) and increasing contact rates between host species (i.e., amplification effect) in a rodent-borne disease [45] . Host immunity and parasite-parasite interactions may also shape disease distributions as they may facilitate or limit transmission [6, 7, 41, 46] . For instance, decreased competence of the bacterium Rickettsia conorii was observed in dogs previously infected by other Rickettsia species [47] . Given the complexity of these interactions, traditional single-species ENM approaches could fail to accurately predict disease distributions and transmission risk, particularly at finer scales. However, traditional approaches may be sufficient for some disease systems, especially if they are simple or well understood (e.g., dengue). Therefore, appropriate selection of the approach will depend on data availability and the question at hand.\n",
            " A common assumption of disease ENM is that predicted host distributions and disease presence are equivalent [17, 32] . This should be considered with caution since susceptible hosts may occur where parasites are absent, and even when infection occurs, disease may be absent [7, 48] . For example, flying foxes (Pteropus medius) are necessary hosts for Nipah virus persistence; however, this virus can be absent in areas where flying fox populations are present [48] . Therefore, host presence should be considered only as 'vessels' available for parasite introduction, establishment, and spread (Box 1). Likewise, parasites are generally assumed to be homogeneously distributed across the host's range (uniform prevalence; Figure 1A ) and fine-scale mechanisms underlying parasite transmission (e.g., host movement, behavior, demographics) are usually not considered.\n",
            " Spillover: process in which a pathogen is transmitted into a novel host species, mainly referring to the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans. Susceptibility: possibility of a given exposure to hazard resulting in harm; also termed vulnerability by some authors.\n",
            " Target population: population that is the focus of a study or public health intervention.\n",
            " Vector: a living organism, typically invertebrate, acting as intermediary in the transmission of a parasite from a source to a target population. Zoonoses: diseases that can be transmitted between humans and animals under natural conditions. Outcomes of host-parasite interactions are highly variable, ranging from no apparent negative effects on the host (e.g., asymptomatic or subclinical infection) to host mortality [49] [50] [51] . A review of mammal-virus associations reported that the vast majority of infected mammal species were asymptomatic (224 of 312 mammal-virus pairs) [52] . Hantavirus infections in Box 1. Guidelines for ENM to Predict Disease Distributions\n",
            " The predictive power and biological realism of ENM forecasts of diseases is likely to improve by the inclusion of biotic interactors [10, 43] . However, reliable parasite, or disease, occurrence records and information on disease natural history may be lacking, posing an exceptional challenge for disease distribution modeling. Knowing the data limitations of a disease system is crucial for predictor variable and evaluation metric selection and the incorporation of biotic interactors [24] . Understanding of the biological meaning, assumptions, and units of outputs is equally important for proper model interpretation. We discuss the most frequently encountered scenarios in disease ENM and how biotic interactors should be included accordingly ( Figure I) .\n",
            " (1) Available occurrence data and known transmission mechanism: When parasite occurrence data are available, these should be preferred over disease outbreak data to minimize spatiotemporal uncertainty. However, if reliable site of infection data are available these should ideally be used. In this case, component-based approaches focused on modeling the geographic potential of the parasite can be implemented. Information on host species (e.g., distribution, abundance) can be incorporated as predictor variables (preprocessing) to complement abiotic variables. However, model outputs should be interpreted with caution as proper definition of units may be difficult [24] .\n",
            " (2) Unavailable occurrence data and known transmission mechanism: Given the reliance of parasites on host species, component-based modeling of hosts could be used to identify suitable areas for parasite persistence. That is, estimated host distributions are used as a proxy for potential parasite distributions. Selection of host species (e.g., identity, number) for modeling will depend on their role in the disease system as well as the nature of the system itself. If parasite persistence depends on interactions between different host species, stacked or joint host distribution models (post-processing) can be used, assuming parasite presence is equal or more likely in areas where all of its hosts are found than where only one host species is found [24] . Likewise, seasonal factors capable of affecting transmission (e.g., rainfall, migration patterns) should be accounted for whenever possible. However, excessive use of abiotic and biotic variables could generate over-fit and complex models, which may be difficult to parameterize and interpret. (3) Unavailable occurrence data and unknown transmission mechanism: This situation warrants black-box modeling [18] . The point-radius method can be used to mitigate geographic uncertainty inherent to human disease data [91] . Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in environmental dimensions, outlying disease cases reported in areas of inconsistent environmental conditions (e.g., imported cases) can be removed. Due to the temporal lag between infection and disease expression, temporal uncertainty of exposure should be considered to ensure that environmental variables match disease reports. North America can result in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is often fatal in humans while having no discernible impact on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), its primary host [46] . Host immunity, genetics, and physiology also play important roles in disease expression, varying among individuals [6, 49, 53] and populations [54] . The generalist amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) can cause disease in some amphibian species but not others; thus, mapping a single host would underestimate the parasite's geographic distribution ( Figure 1B) .\n",
            " Selection of ecologically relevant predictor variables is necessary to generate reliable modeling outputs and should be supported by the biology of the species and the spatiotemporal scale at hand [26, 55] . Variables directly affecting a species' physiology are preferred since their relationships with its geographic distribution are assumed to be stable across spatiotemporal scales [26, 56] . Indirect variables may be employed as proxies for direct variables, although these should be avoided if they are correlated with factors driving the demography, dispersal, or distribution of biotic interactors [26] . For example, in the tropics, altitude could serve as a proxy for temperature and has been used to predict the distribution of mosquito-borne diseases, since vector distribution is restricted by low temperatures. However, elevation can be a confounding factor not related to the species' physiology, as compared with temperature, and in general, should be avoided.\n",
            " In disease systems, the effects (direct/indirect) of abiotic variables depend on the parasite's ecology and relationship with its hosts. Parasite life cycles range from having free-living stages to being completely restricted within a host. Leptospira bacteria (the causative agent of leptospirosis) are capable of persisting in humid soils and waterlogged environments [57] . In this case, environmental variables such as precipitation or the presence of seasonal water bodies are more likely to have direct effects. Conversely, parasites unable to persist outside their hosts, like rabies viruses [58] , are likely to be influenced by environmental variables (e.g., climate) indirectly. Hence, host availability may directly affect the maintenance of host-restricted parasites. The nature of the parasite-host association will determine the ecological relevance of environmental variables and how these should be employed to model parasite distributions.\n",
            " Epidemiological strategies to control diseases focus on regulating parasite transmission from a source population (usually wildlife or domestic hosts) to a target population (usually humans or domestic animals) [38, 59, 60] . Component-based ENM (details in Modeling Disease System section) can be used to identify areas where potential disease sources and target populations overlap, allowing informed interventions [60, 61] . This requires a comprehensive understanding of the natural history of the disease system to properly identify host species acting as sources and spreaders of infection [38] . Misidentification of the host and parasite species involved in epidemics and spillover events, or their functional roles in disease maintenance, may lead to ineffective or counterproductive control measures with potential social and economic costs [6, 38, 61] .\n",
            " In single-host systems (Figure 2A ), disease control strategies should target regions where source populations overlap with the target population ( Figure 2B ; [38, 61] ). This can rapidly become complicated in multihost systems as changes in the host community may impact parasite maintenance or transmission ( Figure 2C ; see [41, 61] ). Further complications arise when hosts act as bridges facilitating parasite transmission between spatially disjoint host populations ( Figure 2C ,D) [38] . For example, wild birds associated with wetlands and aquatic environments, such as shorebirds (Charadriiformes; gulls, terns, and waders) and waterfowl (Anseriformes; ducks, geese, and swans), constitute the host reservoir for avian influenza ( Figure 2C ). Since shorebirds and livestock are spatially disjunct ( Figure 2D) , strategies aimed at this group only would not stop influenza transmission from waterfowl to livestock and consequent human infection, despite them being part of the reservoir.\n",
            " Appropriate selection and inclusion of biotic interactors in parasite ENM requires prior identification of suitable host species ( Figure 3A) ; that is, host species that possess characteristics supporting parasite survival, reproduction, and transmission and are therefore essential for parasite persistence [35, 36, 62, 63] . For a given parasite, different suitable host species must share particular traits enabling its establishment and persistence [9, 35, 63] . Here, we propose an adaptation of the niche concept that considers host traits as microscale abiotic and biotic dimensions of parasite niches, defined here as host-space (H-space in Figure 3B ).\n",
            " Under this proposed approach, associations between parasites and host populations can be summarized by adapting the traditional biotic, abiotic, and movement (BAM) framework\n",
            " Occurrence points (Box 2) to host-space. We refer to this adapted framework as BAM-H ( Figure 3B ). Here, B H represents the set of dynamically linked (biotic) factors favoring persistence in hosts where bidirectional effects with parasite load can be observed (i.e., affected by parasite abundance) [26, 64] , such as immune response (similar to predator-prey interactions) [46, 49, 54] or Transferring the theoretical representation of the BAM framework (left) to an empirical ecological niche modeling (ENM) application using real-world data to reconstruct the geography of dengue virus in Guatemala (right). Here, the biotic component of the parasite, B, is denoted by the fundamental niche of the dengue vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti (red polyhedron) [8] . A (gray points) summarizes global bioclimatic variables [89] condensed in three principal components. Finally, the dispersal potential, M, was restricted to Guatemala as the area of interest (black polyhedron).\n",
            " (B,C) Model predictions of disease distributions are affected by the inclusion of biotic interactions within the ENM framework.\n",
            " coinfection (similar to facilitation/competition) [65] [66] [67] . HIV infection, for example, facilitates the establishment of other parasitic organisms including viruses, bacteria [65] , and protozoa [68] . A H comprises the set of physical and chemical (e.g., body temperature, pH, presence of cell receptors in the membrane) host traits representing suitable conditions for establishment and persistence with generally unidirectional effects on parasite load [6, 26, 36, 41, 64] . For example, rabies virus can survive only in hosts with a specific body temperature range (4-39 C) [58] , resulting in a predominance of mammalian hosts (37 C) but not birds (40 C) . Similarly, SARS coronavirus cannot infect cells lacking angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its entry receptor [69] . Last, M H represents the set of host species populations that have been accessible for the parasite to disperse (i.e., transmit). Transmission between individuals is essential to guarantee parasite maintenance [also expressed as basic reproductive number (R 0 ) > 1] in a host population (i.e., intraspecies transmission) or community (i.e., interspecies transmission). Although dispersal-related parasite traits (e.g., free living vs host restricted) are important determinants of transmissibility, parasite mobility can be further constrained by host demography and ecology [18, 70] ; however, these traits may be less relevant for parasites with environmental reservoirs (e.g., anthrax). For example, parasite persistence may not be possible if the host population size is too small (similar to Allee effects). Social contact, grooming rate, or burrowing behavior limits the transmission of parasites (e.g., fleas in small mammals) [71] . Factors constraining transmission can operate across multiple spatial scales, ranging from limited dispersal between individuals in a population (e.g., decreased host population size for density-dependent transmission) to barriers between host populations (e.g., geographic barriers). Parasites may be absent in suitable hosts due to local parasite extinction, seasonality (e.g., host migration patterns, precipitation patterns needed for parasite transmission), dispersal, or transmission limitations (e.g., geographic barriers, low host density, host immunity) and in the case of economically important hosts (e.g., livestock) due to disease management control (e.g., vaccination, disease control programs). Transient infections could also occur in dead-end hosts (H DE ) ( Figure 3B ,C), unsuitable hosts limiting their persistence (R 0 1; i.e., sink populations). Our approach is complementary to traditional parasite ENM and classic transmission models. By identifying parasite host breadth, BAM-H would allow the proper identification of relevant biotic interactors that inform parasite ENM and should therefore be used jointly (Figure 3 ).\n",
            " Closely related host species tend to share ecological, physiological, and immunological traits, making them more likely to share parasites [36, [74] [75] [76] . The identification of closely related hosts (i.e., sharing similar traits) could help to identify potential reservoirs and predict potential spillover (H P ), analogous to predicting suitable geographic areas (novel hosts) for species invasion (parasite spillover) in invasion ecology. Parasite sharing among closely related host species (phylogenetic clustering) could be interpreted as parasite niche conservatism in host-space [as observed in kissing bug species (Triatoma sp.) in North and Central America] [77] . Potential hosts (H P ) would therefore be more likely to be closely related to known hosts. Conversely, parasite sharing among distantly related host species (phylogenetic overdispersion) implies that parasite sharing among known hosts is driven by factors other than host relatedness, important to consider when determining H P . Such factors may include broad physiological tolerances (large A H ) or increased transmissibility (M H ) between host populations with overlapping geographic ranges ( Figure 3C [36, 75] ). Furthermore, parasites may experience expansions in their occupied host breadth (H O ) following landscape alterations or shifts in their geographic distributions [75, 78] (see Box 3 for applications).\n",
            " Despite widespread recognition of the need for risk assessments to ensure successful disease intervention strategies, definitions of risk remain inconsistent. These definitions seem to confound the different processes contributing to risk, hindering proper quantification and comparisons between assessments [85] . A recently proposed framework aimed to disentangle the underlying mechanisms of risk by decomposing it into three processes: parasite availability (hazard), contact with parasites (exposure), and likelihood of infection (susceptibility) [85] .\n",
            " Our proposed integrative ENM framework combines traditional parasite ENM with the hostspace concept, allowing a more comprehensive estimate of the potential geographic distribution of diseases across scales, and could therefore be implemented to estimate hazard (parasite availability). However, we must note that this is only one component driving disease risk for a target population (Box 3). Several often interacting factors such as behavior [59] , nutrition [86] , immune history [47] , and social status [33, 87, 88] are critical for successful parasite maintenance. When possible, these factors should be considered and incorporated into ENM frameworks to enrich risk assessments. Exposure can be incorporated by overlaying the geographic distribution and densities of the target population (e.g., humans) [14] . Susceptibility factors could be added by including information on socioeconomic (e.g., GDP, age) or cultural (e.g., taboo systems, traditional practices) factors influencing exposure to hazard. An example of susceptibility factors increasing exposure is the traditional funeral practices involving the touching and kissing of dead bodies that contributed to the spread of Ebola in the 2014 West African outbreak [59] .\n",
            " Disease risk mapping still faces considerable challenges. Gathering information of parasite occurrence data, in both animals and humans, can suffer from logistic (e.g., sampling in remote Box 3. Improving Epidemiological Surveillance: Using Ecophylogenetics to Estimate Host Breadth Epidemiological surveillance aims to identify and monitor disease-causative agents and to use this information to inform public health policy. However, how can we possibly achieve these goals when we do not know which areas or host species should be targeted for surveillance? Ecophylogenetics provide a basis to disentangle the relative contributions of host relatedness (phylogeny) and host ecology (e.g., interaction networks, demography) to parasite-sharing patterns among different host populations ( Figure 3C [78] ). Integrating phylogenetics with community ecology could help in understanding patterns of host phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion across spatiotemporal scales. This holds great potential for the development of new tools to predict parasite host breadths (H P and H O in our proposed framework), a key component of understanding disease transmission dynamics at the landscape level [56, 77] . Additionally, ecophylogenetics may provide insights on potential spillover events that could result in disease emergence, a highly relevant topic under global change and increased international movement of species leading to shifts in host communities and translocation of parasites to new areas and hosts [79, 80] . Adoption of the host-space framework under ecophylogenetics could improve epidemiological surveillance, allowing early targeting of potentially suitable hosts (HP) [62, 63] .\n",
            " Current initiatives such as the Global Mammal Database [81] , the Malaria Atlas Project [82] , and COMADRE [83] could lay the groundwork to implement the host-space framework and serve as a platform to integrate data from different sources similar to large-scale biodiversity repositories (e.g., the Global Biodiversity Information Facility [84] ). Coupling ecophylogenetics with ENM could increase our understanding of how external environmental conditions (e.g., climate) and host traits explain disease distributions, although these approaches have rarely been applied until recently [78] . Nevertheless, although the theoretical basis to target potential hosts via ecophylogenetics exists, further work is required to successfully implement this approach.\n",
            " areas, ethical human-subject-research regulations) and ecological (e.g., low prevalence, latency) limitations. Parasite detection may be limited by the choice of clinical screening method. Serology tests report past infection whereas PCR or deep-sequencing methods detect parasites present at the moment of collection. Data on susceptibility factors are limited and their effects are not always understood, hindering proper quantification of susceptibility. We believe that a next frontier in disease risk mapping should focus on overcoming these limitations. Investment in active surveillance efforts in wildlife and human populations, as well as new technologies and tools (Box 3) for parasite detection and identification techniques, may improve our ability to collect more reliable disease occurrence data. Interdisciplinary approaches integrating ecology and social sciences may further our understanding on how biological and socioeconomic factors interact to influence disease risk.\n",
            " ENM is a powerful tool to better understand the distributional ecology of diseases. We described how biotic interactions make disease systems more ecologically complex than the traditional biodiversity studies for which ENM was designed. Limited knowledge on disease natural history (e.g., transmission mechanism, host species involved) may considerably change modeling assumptions, resulting in ecologically unrealistic outputs. Here, we present a new frameworkthe host-space nichethat is complementary to traditional parasite ENM, which should improve the integration of parasite-host interactions. This host-space niche framework will help in identifying relevant biotic interactors and understanding disease distributions across landscapes.\n",
            " Finally, we point out that risk can be defined only when a target population is identified. Risk depends on multiple interacting factors including parasite presence, exposure, and the susceptibility of the target population. We emphasize the need for a clear and uniform definition of risk as well as a unified methodological framework to quantify it. Quantification of disease transmission risk is also important for strategic allocation of resources for public health and the conservation of endangered host populations.\n",
            " The ideas presented here should encourage discussion towards a comprehensive methodological framework to quantify and map disease distributions and risk that are based on ecological and epidemiological theory (see Outstanding Questions). However, challenges remain, particularly ensuring that disease occurrence data reflect the site of infection and the biological realism of model assumptions. Increased epidemiological surveillance and data sharing via online repositories will facilitate the establishment of a renovated field of disease mapping based on ecological theories. We provide guidelines (Box 1) to estimate the geographic distribution of diseases via ENM by accounting for data limitations and different ecological scales. The incorporation of biotic interactors into the models will allow more realistic estimates of disease distributions that could help to guide cost-effective disease control efforts.\n",
            " How can disease occurrence data be improved? Besides spatial and temporal biases, disease occurrence data may also be skewed by uneven sampling of host species (e.g., reservoirs) and reports of the locality of development of symptoms or the locality of the diagnosis, misrepresenting the locality of infection. Active surveillance efforts targeting parasite sampling in host taxa could help to reduce these biases, increase understanding of parasite dispersal, and improve occurrence reporting.\n",
            " Can host traits be used to predict parasite host breadth? We have proposed a niche-conservatism approach to identify potential hosts given their phylogenetic relatedness with known hosts. Host traits essential for parasite establishment can be determined in a more mechanistic manner through experimental testing of parasite physiological niches and may be validated in laboratory essays.\n",
            " How can risk factors be integrated into ENM frameworks to quantify disease transmission risk? Behavioral and clinical surveillance provides insights on factors influencing exposure and susceptibility to infective parasites. However, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary to adequately generate data-driven models useful for policy making. Integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches remains a challenge in ENM disease risk mapping, which usually neglects the human dimension of disease transmission. \n",

            "Body Text: Arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes have been expanding their global distribution in recent years, and new viruses , such as chikungunya and Zika, have emerged and spread globally [1] . This expansion is thought to be attributed to a combination of increased urbanization, global travel, and environmental changes associated with increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns [2] . That the latter of these is driving arbovirus expansion is not unexpected: mosquitos are ectotherms that depend upon water sources to complete their life cycles, so temperature, precipitation, and humidity play critical roles in the mosquito-vectored arbovirus transmission cycle [3] [4] [5] . Global surface temperatures have increased by 0.8-1.2 C above pre-industrial levels, and precipitation data show uncharacteristically extreme variations in rainfall [6, 7] . Because of this, the global landscape of mosquito-borne arboviruses is being transformed as suitability for mosquito populations and the viruses they transmit changes. Autochthonous transmission of mosquito-borne arboviruses is occurring more frequently in subtropical and temperate regions, occurring at higher elevations in tropical regions, and becoming increasingly more intense in endemic regions, leading to larger outbreaks [8 ,9,10 ] . In the present work, we investigate recent emergence and expansion of arboviruses transmitted by the anthropophilic mosquito species Aedes aegypti (and in some case the secondary vector Aedes albopictus) as a case study for environmentally driven arboviral expansion. We first describe known relationships among meteorological variables, mosquitoes, and arboviruses. We next describe the ongoing global expansion of dengue as it relates to climate and discuss the novel outbreaks of chikungunya and Zika virus that began in 2013 and 2015, respectively. We discuss recent arbovirus activity in the temperate Argentinian city of Có rdoba, where the emergence of dengue began in 2009 and has been ongoing. Finally, we review recent work aimed at better understanding the impacts of climate and changes thereof on present and future arbovirus activity and highlight gaps in empirical and modeling studies that could help us better understand the future of arbovirus transmission under a changing climate.\n",
            " Dengue (DENV serotypes 1-4), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses are transmitted to people primarily by the female Ae. aegypti mosquito [11] . Ae albopictus has been implicated as a secondary vector in the transmission of all three arboviruses as well [11] . These viruses cause a significant and growing burden of febrile illness in people worldwide. Severe clinical manifestations of dengue fever, although less common, can result in hemorrhage, shock, and death in some cases [12] . CHIKV infections are characterized by fever and severe arthralgias, with increasing evidence of fatal complications [13] . ZIKV was designated by the World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in 2016 after congenital and neurological complications were associated with infections [14] . Co-infections are common, and differential diagnosis is difficult in the absence of molecular diagnostics (e.g., PCR) due to similar clinical presentation [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . No specific therapeutic treatment is available for these arboviruses, and vector control remains the primary public health intervention to prevent and respond to epidemics. A DENV vaccine is available in some countries; however, it is recommended to be used only for seropositive individuals older than nine years [22] .\n",
            " Temperature plays an important role in the transmission of arboviruses, due to nonlinear effects on mosquito physiology, which affect rates of development and mortality in Aedes mosquitos [5, 23, 24] . Temperature also regulates viral incubation in the mosquito vector, with optimal warm temperatures reducing the extrinsic incubation period [25, 26 ] . Understanding the effects of rainfall on arbovirus transmission is more complex and depends on the local social-ecological context. The Ae. aegypti mosquito prefers to breed and lay eggs in containers that hold water, often in and around the home, where female mosquitoes blood feed on people. Increases in rainfall can increase vector populations due to an abundance of rain-filled containers around dwellings [27] . However, drought conditions and water scarcity can also increase vector populations if people begin to store water in containers around the home [28].\n",
            " Numerous studies have looked at the links among temperature, Aedes populations, and arbovirus transmission. Mechanistic models based on mosquito thermal biology suggest that DENV transmission occurs optimally at 28. 1 C in Ae. aegypti, and 26.4 C in Ae. albopictus [29] . Other studies have examined suitability of habitats for Aedes mosquito expansion and potential of regions to support arbovirus transmission under current climate conditions and predicted climate change scenarios [10 ,30,31] . A recent study in Ecuador determined that Ae. aegypti will expand its range into higher elevations of the Andean foothills, estimated to affect 4215 km 2 of new territory and 12 000 people under the most extreme scenario of climate change by 2050 [32 ] . Similar elevational range expansions are to be expected throughout the tropical Andes, increasing the population at risk of arboviral infections. Although arboviral disease burden is expected to worsen globally, some of these models suggest that transmission of arboviruses may decrease in tropical regions due to temperatures that become too warm to sustain mosquito populations [10 ,29] . It is also possible that local mosquito populations may evolve to be better adapted to changing climate conditions.\n",
            " DENV re-emerged in the Americas during the 1980s and 1990s, with all four serotypes (DENV1-4) co-circulating and causing major epidemics in urban areas throughout the region [33] . In the past two decades alone, dengue has expanded its range beyond subtropical and tropical regions of the globe, with autochthonous transmission and outbreaks occurring in parts of the United States, southern Europe, Uruguay, central Argentina, and Australia [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . In the United States, outbreaks have occurred in Hawaii, southern Florida, and along the Mexico-Texas border [34, 35, 38, 41] . In Europe, a large outbreak of dengue was reported in Madeira, Portugal in 2012-2013, with DENV likely originating from Venezuela [37, 42] . Autochthonous transmission has also been reported for the first time in southern France and Croatia [36, 39] . In South America, autochthonous dengue transmission was reported in subtropical regions of Argentina in 1997 and Uruguay in 2016 for the first time since Ae. aegypti was though to to be eliminated in the 1960s [40, 43] . Today, Aedes populations are found throughout Europe, the temperate Southern Cone of South America, and the United States, and the threat of importation of Aedes populations, and potentially the arboviruses transmitted by the mosquito vectors, is rising with increases in global travel and as the climate becomes more suitable for transmission.\n",
            " In endemic populations, dengue outbreaks are increasing in frequency and magnitude. In 2019, much of tropical and subtropical parts of the world experienced increases in dengue transmission that surpassed orders of magnitude. The Americas are currently reporting a resurgence of DENV, with 3 139 335 cases of dengue fever reported by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in 2019 alone, the highest number of cases ever reported in a single year in the Americas [44] . Over two million cases were reported from Brazil alone; however, the highest incidence rates were reported from countries in Central America (Nicaragua, Belize, Honduras) [44] . This resurgence continues in 2020, with PAHO reporting over 1.6 million cases to date (EW 24). Argentina is currently experiencing its largest dengue epidemic on record, with more than 78,000 cases from EW 31 in 2019 to EW 20 in 2020, according to the National Epidemiological Reports of the Ministry of Health; approximately half of the cases are from the central temperate region [67,68].\n",
            " In 2013, CHIKV emerged in the Caribbean and spread rapidly throughout Central and South America [45] . Both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were implicated in the transmission of CHIKV [46] . The expansion of both vectors due to meteorological extremes is also a likely factor in the rapid spread of chikungunya, as a number of outbreaks followed extreme rainfall events [47, 48] . Furthermore, the year 2014 was the first in a sequence of years that are now listed as the warmest years on record [49] . A large outbreak of chikungunya was reported in Italy, with over 300 cases reported, and autochthonous transmission was also reported in France [50, 51] . In the Americas, over 1.1 million cases were reported in 2014 [52] .\n",
            " Beginning in 2015, ZIKV emerged and spread with extreme intensity throughout the Americas. Between 2015-2016 laboratory-confirmed and suspected cases were reported from 87 countries and territories worldwide, with over 750 000 cases reported from the Americas alone [53, 54] . Autochthonous ZIKV transmission was reported in southern Florida, France, and Argentina-regions at the edge of the historical range of arbovirus transmission [53] .\n",
            " A region of notable Ae. aegypti and DENV emergence is the temperate Southern Cone of South America. Early Climate change and arbovirus emergence Robert, Stewart-Ibarra and Estallo 3 cases of dengue fever were reported in Argentina in 1916, and no cases were reported for 80 years [43] . Ae aegypti was eliminated from all of Argentina in 1963 following aggressive vector control campaigns in response to the yellow fever pandemic; however, the vector became reestablished in its historic range and has spread into new southern latitudes. By 1986, the vector was detected in the northeast subtropical region, and in 1997 the first autochthonous cases were confirmed in northwestern Argentina [43] .\n",
            " Ae aegypti was detected in the city of Có rdoba, Argentina, for the first time in 1995. The city has a population of about 1.4 million and is located in the central region of the country (31.4 S, 64.2 W). Có rdoba has a temperate climate with warm rainy summers (November-March), and cool, dry winters (June-September). Of note, the Ministry of Health has not detected vector activity during the winter months, thus suggesting that local arbovirus transmission requires annual importation of the virus, likely from people traveling to endemic regions [55 ] .\n",
            " In 2009, Có rdoba experienced its first dengue epidemic on record, with 130 total cases reported [55 ] . In 2013, 2015, and 2016, Có rdoba experienced epidemics of increasing magnitude, with 822 cases of dengue reported in 2016 (Figure 1 ). The city is currently experiencing the largest dengue outbreak on record, with more than 7,500 cases reported from EW 31 in 2019 to EW 24 in 2020 [68]. In 2014 and 2016 imported cases of CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, were first reported in Có rdoba, although no vector-borne autochthonous transmission has been reported for either virus. Imported DENV cases were noted from the northern provinces of Argentina and neighboring dengue endemic countries (Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay) [55 ] .\n",
            " Following the first outbreak, a robust entomological surveillance study was initiated in 2009, allowing for monitoring of vector dynamics during the first 10 years of arbovirus emergence [56 ] . A recent analysis of Ae. aegypti from this surveillance study, dengue cases and local climate in Có rdoba revealed significant increases in Ae. aegypti population size between 2010 and 2017. Oviposition and larval abundance were significantly positively correlated with mean temperature in the same month. Monthly anomalies in minimum temperature, calculated using a thirty-year base period (1987-2017), indicate that this period of dengue emergence has been characterized by warmer than average temperatures, with 60% of months (65 of 108) warmer than the long term average of a given month (Figure 1b) . Each of the outbreaks has been preceded by extreme meteorological events ( Figure 1 ). Outbreaks in 2015 and 2016 followed extreme precipitation events where monthly precipitation reached a peak of 8.90 and 11.13 mm, respectively, above monthly averages (Figure 1a,c) . Outbreaks in 2013 and 2016 followed closely after periods in which the monthly mean minimum temperature was as much as 3 C higher than monthly averages, and the 2009 and 2015 outbreaks occurred during periods in which the monthly mean temperature was 2-3 C higher than monthly averages (Figure 1b,c) . The current 2020 epidemic is an order of magnitude greater than outbreaks previously experienced. However, it is hypothesized that the epidemic has grown due to the increased time that people are spending in their homes, exposed to Ae. aegypti, due to mandatory quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate and other non-climate co-variates that may have increased the likelihood of the current epidemic also need to be explored.\n",
            " Ongoing research in Có rdoba continues to assess the role of climate in mosquito-borne disease emergence at a local level over a long-term period. Although meteorological anomolies have been associated with each of the dengue outbreaks in the last decade, it is difficult to find significant relationships between climate and dengue transmission in a period of initial emergence with four outbreaks across ten years. It is, however, possible with the available data to begin exploring the effects of climare variability and extreme climate events on arbovirus transmission, and, as we have done here, use the results of this exploration to inform future studies aimed at finding signficant links between climate and arbovirus transmission. Có rdoba is among a short list of places where an actively emerging arbovirus can be carefully studied and may provide important insights to understanding the emergence of arboviruses globally.\n",
            " With concerns of continued global expansion of arboviruses driven by climate change, much effort has been placed on developing a better understanding of which regions of the world are at risk today and in the future. Many mathematical and statistical studies have investigated the potential for dengue and related arboviruses to emerge in naive populations as a result of global rises in surface temperatures [57] . Studies have emphasized the connection between climate and dengue and predicted the potential for expansion of both the vectors and the arboviruses into regions at the margins of transmission that are currently deemed unsuitable for arbovirus transmission [10 ,58,59 ,60] . Region-specific studies have predicted the potential for greater suitability for arbovirus transmission in some major U.S. cities [61 ] , rural and southern regions of Brazil [62] , and central and western regions of China [63] , among others.\n",
            " Although multiple studies have been conducted at the global scale, there are a dearth of local longitudinal studies in zones of current and future arbovirus emergence. The recent work investigating the impacts of climate on dengue in Có rdoba is among the few longitudinal studies that aim to connect dengue emergence with temperature and precipitation in a temperate region. While global analyses are informative, it is local analyses that underscore the evidence that climate and arbovirus transmission are closely linked. Studies aimed at detecting arbovirus emergence and investigating links between transmission and climate are vital to our ability to understand, predict, and respond to emergence events [64, 65] . In a recent study, health sector stakeholders from the Caribbean have highlighted the urgent need for more local studies linking climate and arboviral disease-without this information, they are limited in their ability to take informed actions to adapt to a changing climate [66 ] .\n",
            " Additional empirical, modeling, and statistical studies are imperative for developing a better understanding of the links between climate and arbovirus transmission, particularly in regions at the margin of arbovirus emergence. In addition, resources are needed to strengthen entomological and epidemiological surveillance by the public health sector in regions of emergence, and the establishment of sentinel surveillance sites in zones of likely future emergence. \n",

            " The onset of new viral pathogens with a high epidemic-pandemic potential is often the result of complex interactions between animals, humans and environment (Coker et al., 2011) . The latter can play an important role in the dynamics of human diseases since it has long been known that climate changes affect human health concerning not only chronic pathologies but also infectious diseases (Epstein, 1999 (Epstein, , 2001 Kovats et al., 2000; Costello et al., 2009; Altizer et al., 2013; Bouzid et al., 2014; Willox et al., 2015) .\n",
            " Favorable climate conditions are necessary for survival, reproduction, transmission and spread of pathogens, of their vectors and hosts. Significant correlations between some climate indicators and the spread of COVID-19 epidemic have been documented (Araújo and Naimi, 2020; Aribi and Sghaier, 2020; Barcelò, 2020b; Bashir et al., 2020) . Indeed, changes in climate conditions can indirectly influence the epidemiology of infectious diseases through the modification of the living environment of the involved etiological agents (Epstein, 2001; Wu et al., 2014) . According to the European Environment Agency (EEA, 2008) , in the 20th century the global average surface temperature has increased by 0.74°C, determining the reduction of the polar caps by 2.7% per decade and the increase of the global sea level of 1.8 mm per year since 1961. These changes have caused the occurrence of extreme weather events in many parts of the world. At the beginning of 2000s, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated an average temperature increase of 1.5-5.8°C during the 21st century, with more and more frequent extreme events such as heat waves, floods and droughts (IPCC, 2001) .\n",
            " Several studies have shown that long-term climate warming can favor the geographic spread of many infectious diseases (Epstein et al., 1998; Rodó et al., 2013; Ostfeld and Brunner, 2015) . Moreover, extreme weather events may influence the epidemiology of infectious diseases determining changes of their spatial and temporal distribution as well as of the intensity of outbreaks and of the global emergency and re-emergency of infectious agents (McMichael et al., 1996; Epstein, 2000; Kuhn et al., 2005; Wu et al., factors, since they have been estimated to cause several million deaths per year worldwide (Lelieveld et al., 2015 (Lelieveld et al., , 2019 . Atmospheric pollutants can induce pro-inflammation and oxidation mechanisms in lungs and other organs, impairing also immune processes. From these evidences, a negative effect of air pollution on the prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 is conceivable. A similar link between pollution and incidence of disease has been studied during the previous SARS epidemic. In 2003, Cui et al. observed that patients living in regions with moderated air pollution levels died more frequently compared to those living in regions with low air pollution levels. Air pollutants can elicit different toxicological mechanisms, such as cytotoxicity through oxidative stress with overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), DNA oxidative damage, mutagenicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and stimulation of pro-inflammatory responses (Di Pietro et al. 2009 , 2011 Visalli et al., 2015) . Moreover, in Italy, during the initial phases of COVID pandemic, remarkable higher mortality rates were observed in northern regions, notoriously more polluted compared to other ones, suggesting a role of pollution in the spread of pandemic (Conticini et al., 2020) . However, current data on COVID-19 spread and mortality could be altered by the different approaches used for studying COVID-19-related deaths and infected people. Recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in countries such as Spain, France, USA and UK having pollution levels very different from those of the northern Italy suggest that in the spread and mortality of COVID-19 are probably involved different variables, among which the age and density of the affected population, its social habits, the policies adopted to contain the diffusion of the infection, and also meteorological conditions (Contini and Costabile, 2020).\n",
            " Like other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, depending on the aerial spread of respiratory droplets, exposes the virus to external environmental conditions. Therefore, the spread of this virus is likely constrained by climate factors. Regarding the potential impact of latitude on the viral transmission, while some authors (Oktorie and Berd, 2020) have suggested as an unlikely event the spread of COVID-19 pandemics at high latitudes or poles, due to their characteristics of remote regions and with low population densities, a growing concern for the transmission to Antarctic wildlife has been reported by other studies (Barbosa et al. 2021) . This aspect could be in relation to the increasing anthropogenic activities in these vulnerable regions of the Earth, stressing the need for suitable containment measures.\n",
            " In this scenario, the outbreak of Coronavirus has been considered as a clear message sent by Gaia 7 et al., 2020; Bar, 2020). Even animal life benefits from the stop of the human activities. The behavioral changes of wild animals such as birds, insects, and street animals indicate the impact that human activities have on living beings. A certain correlation between atmospheric changes and changes in the behavior of animals during lockdown period has also been observed (Bar, 2020).\n",
            " On the other hand, another important feature of COVID-19 pandemic is related to the massive use of disinfectants to counteract the viral transmission. Among these compounds, an extensive analysis of the potential impact on water quality and ecosystem health by the use of chlorine (NaClO) as the cheapest tool to avoid viral transmission, has been reported by García-Avila et al. (2020) . These Authors have underlined that in the environment chlorine is transformed into highly dangerous compounds (i.e. halogenated organic compounds) that are toxic for marine biota, since they can persist in the environment longer than chlorine.\n",

Increased concern has also been posed by the amplified plastic pollution consequent to the use of Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) such as protective masks or gloves (Abbasi et al., 2020) , that have stimulated the search for sustainable alternatives (i.e. bio-based plastics, Patrício- Silva et al., , 2021 or recycling practices related to circular economy approaches (Adyel, 2020) . Indeed, COVID-19 pandemic has opened new point of views regarding the management of plastic wastes De-la-Torre et al., 2021 , SanJuan-Reyes et al., 2021 , also in relation to their role as vectors of contaminants, including absorbed antibiotics that can select antibiotic-resistant and biofilm-producing bacterial strains (Laganà et al., 2018 (Laganà et al., , 2019 Caruso, 2019; Patrício-Silva et al., 2021) .\n",
            " All the considerations related to the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aquatic environment stress the need for further studies, addressing the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in aquatic systems while concerted efforts are needed to reduce the load of plastic wastes, in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), such as SDG 14 (United Nations, 2015) .\n",
            " A synthesis of current literature about the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the main environmental compartments (atmosphere, hydrosphere, litosphere, biosphere) is shown in Table 1 However, it has been reported a frequent rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in water systems and that there is no current evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through contaminated drinking-water. Detection of important viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 from urban SARS-CoV-2 is widely reported and this presence can be used to monitor COVID-19 in a community. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in soil even follow the spill of sewage that can act as a source and evidences reported a survival of enveloped viruses in this compartment up to 90 days. However, no paper has been published up to date indicating how this virus could be quantified in soil samples. Table 2 are reported studies about the environmental impact of the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidences show that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an exceptional increase of production, consumption, and disposal of PPE, especially surgical face masks. The overuse of PPEs is determining the increase of plastic pollution especially in water environments. Plastic waste in freshwater and marine environment can be easily ingested by higher organisms, such as fishes, entering in the food chain and potentially determining chronic health problems to humans.\n",
            " Although the main and better-known route of transmission of CoVs is the direct one through the emission of droplets , the environmental survival of SARS-CoV-2 outside the human body and its potential environmental spread via different matrices such as water, air, and food should not be ignored (Núñez-Delgado, 2020). Recently, Yeo et al. (2020) highlighted the potential fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, the release through faeces has been confirmed for SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2005a; Petrich et al., 2006) , MERS-CoV (Zhou and Zhao, 2017) and SARS-CoV-2 (Tian et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b) . Moreover, some researchers focused their attention on the possible CoVs transmission through bioaerosols originated from toilet flushing, as demonstrated by Yu et al. (2004) for SARS-CoV and recently suggested by Ong et al. (2020) for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, an involvement of contaminated food in CoVs transmission can be supposed given the already established survival of the human or animal CoVs on vegetables (Mullis et al., 2013; Yépiz-Gòmez et al., 2013) .\n",
            " The fate of the SARS-CoV-2 in the urban water cycle has raised a great concern in the scientific community, also regarding the pathways of transmission of COVID-19 via building sanitary plumbing systems (Bilal et al. 2020). The need for adequate monitoring programs to evaluate wastewater treatment and fate of urban waters has been underlined, in the light that viral survival and persistence in water systems after wastewater discharge depend on several factors (i.e. temperature, UV or solar inactivation, organic substances, potential competitor microorganisms). The migration pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f aquatic environments have been reviewed by Kumar et al. (2020) . Since most the majority of fecal-oral transmitted viruses are highly persistent in the aquatic environment, the Authors underline that knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 persistence in water is essential to follow viral fate in water, wastewater and groundwater and subsequent human exposure. Therefore, surface water and groundwater represent relevant viral control points through possible leaching and infiltrations of effluents from health care facilities, sewage, and drainage water. In aquatic environments, a literature review on the occurrence, persistence and possible management of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported by Patel et al. (2021) , who have analyzed the main questions related to these issues and suggested the suitability of wastewater-based epidemiology studies to detect the spread of the pandemic.\n",
            " Several studies have been carried out to assess the presence and the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and wastewater, recognizing this environmental compartment as a potential way of exposure to infection (Ahmed et al., 2020; Barcelò, 2020a, b; Corpuz et al., 2020; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020; Nemudryi et al., 2020; Reusken et al., 2020) . Cahill and Morris (2020) have explored the potential risks related to the use of recreational waters, concluding that there have been no reports of humans contracting the SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral transmission to date and therefore the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure to recreational water users is believed to be low, although the potential risk of faecal-oral transmission cannot be excluded where SARS-CoV-2 is present in its infectious state following excretion from human body. At this regard, the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection posed by faecal contaminated water have been assessed by Shutler et al. (2020) , who have reported viral stability within water up to 25 days, and that rivers, waterways and water systems contaminated by high infection rates can provide infectious doses >100 viral copies per 100 ml of water. This issue is mainly related to the evidence that other viruses with the same structural characteristics, such as H1N1 \"Spanish flu\", avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, have been detected in the stools and urine of infected subjects (Wigginton and Ellenberg., 2015) . In this regard, Wang et al. (2005b) showed that SARS-CoV can persist in stools and serum up to 96 h. Also in sewage holding tanks of an international ferry boat, as well as on surface of airconditioners and ventilation systems, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was detected (Mouchtouri et al. 2020 ).\n",
            " Specifically, the Authors assumed the transfer of infected respiratory droplets/nuclei from these surfaces to people standing against the air flow direction.\n",
            " Recent evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater systems has been reported by Ali et al. (2021b) , who have highlighted the presence of this virus in several continents (Europe, Australia, Asia and America), underlying the importance of wastewater-based epidemiology as a new surveillance and prevention tool of viral infectious disease transmission.\n",
            " In general, researches regarding the presence and persistence of viruses in aquatic environments have focused especially on non enveloped enteric viruses, showing a higher resistance in various J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f environmental conditions compared to enveloped ones that are inactivated in water (Wigginton and Ellenberg, 2015; Carducci et al., 2020) . However, in the last decade, some authors have reported the probable presence of enveloped viruses, such as CoVs, in sewage systems (Ikehata et al., 2009; Cantalupo et al., 2011) . In Italy, first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters has been reported by La Rosa et al.\n",
            " (2020a). The survival of CoVs in wastewater can be affected by several variables such as temperature, relative humidity, presence and concentration of suspended solids and disinfection products (Casanova et al., 2010; La Rosa et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2021) . Low temperatures and humidity generally favor high persistence and viability of CoVs (Yeo et al., 2020) . Gundy et al. (2009) reported a decrease of CoVs survival with increasing temperatures in different types of waters (filtered and unfiltered tap water) or wastewaters (filtered and unfiltered primary and secondary effluents). The same authors reported also that the CoVs T99.9 (time for 99.9% of virus titer decrease), in filtered tap water, increased from 10 to ~100 days when temperature decreased from 23°C to 4°C. Moreover, higher T99.9 for the unfiltered wastewater compared to that for the filtered one at the same environmental temperature (23 °C) was observed, suggesting that a higher solid content in water/wastewater could exert a protective effect on the virus and increase its survival in the environment. This was also in agreement with the hydrophobicity of the envelope, responsible for a lower virus solubility in water and a major rate of viral adhesion on solid particles (Gundy et al., 2009) .\n",
            " Viruses are the most abundant particles in all the environments, including seas and oceans where they are present in a concentration of about 10-fold greater than prokaryotic (Suttle, 2005 (Suttle, , 2007 . Previous studies have highlighted that marine viruses play a critical role in determining aquatic communities and influencing ecosystem dynamics (Bergh et al., 1989; Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990; Suttle et al., 1990) . In marine waters, viruses are present at a concentration ranging from about 10 7 to 10 10 L -1 , while in marine sediments from 10 7 to 10 10 g -1 of dry weight. Many studies showed that viruses are abundant especially in surface water and subsurface sediments where their concentration exceeds by 10-1000 times that recorded along the water column (Paul et al., 1993; Maranger and Bird, 1996; Danovaro and Serresi, 2000; Danovaro et al., 2002 Danovaro et al., , 2008a . Some authors found a significant difference in viral abundance among different marine habitats. Specifically, the highest viral presence was found typically in low-salinity coastal waters (Culley and Welschmeyer, 2002; Corinaldesi et al., 2003; Clasen et al., 2008) , and surface coastal sediments (Danovaro et al., 2008b) , decreasing up to three orders of magnitude in deep waters and sea sediments (Hara et al., 1996; Magagnini et al., 2007; Danovaro et al., 2008a, b) . Virioplankton abundances were also found to decrease moving from productive coastal zones to oligotrophic offshore surface waters (Wommack and Colwell, 2000; Corinaldesi et al., 2003; Payet and Suttle, 2008) .\n",
            " Many characteristics of waters, such as temperature, salinity, turbulence and nutrient availability, remarkably influence viral presence in marine ecosystems, because they affect the presence, distribution and metabolism of the planktonic cells acting as viral hosts (Wommack and Colwell, 2000; Weinbauer, 2004) . This is supported by the previously documented significant positive correlation between the viral production and prokaryotic growth rate (Glud and Middelboe, 2004; Mei and Danovaro, 2004; Danovaro et al., 2008b) .\n",
            " As SARS-CoV-2 can reach the marine environment through human fecal emissions and, therefore, Rimoldi et al., 2020). Ye et al. (2016) showed that the coronavirus MHV (Murine Hepatitis Virus) in raw wastewater underwent a 90% reduction in its infectivity after 13 h at 25°C, but remained longer infectious (36 h) at 10°C. The collected evidences suggested that after excretion whole coronavirus particles probably may survive in wastewater depending on different environmental conditions, and, after discharge into aquatic habitats, they may reach coastal marine waters where, however, undergo considerable damage and loss of infectivity. Studies showed that in seawater different viruses, both of eukaryotes and phages, experience particle decay, at different rates, as a result of sunlight (UV-C radiation) and interaction with nucleases and proteases present in marine microorganisms and free in water (Heldal and Bratbak, 1991; Wommack et al., 1996; Noble and Fuhrman, 1997; Wilhelm et al., 1998) . However, the decay of CoVs in natural waters has not been studied.\n",
            " Concerning the presence of CoVs in biota, members of the family Coronaviridae are known to infect not only birds and mammals, but also invertebrates, reptiles, amphibian and even fish (Bukhari et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2018 , Mordecai et al., 2019 . Confirmed associations of CoVs with aquatic biota have been listed by Wartecki and Rzymski (2020) , who have suggested the role of aquatic environments inhabited by large populations of flock-forming or colony-forming waterfowls and frequently visited by bats, as possible hotspots of CoVs, with potential cross-species transmission. Regarding marine biota, to date there is no evidence of Betacoronaviruses members hosted by marine animals, while members of both Alphacoronaviruses and Gammacoronaviruses have been described in marine mammals (Schütze, 2016; Bossart and Duignan, 2018) such as Alphacoronavirus in the Harbor Seal (Bossart and Schwartz, 1990) , Gammacoronavirus in the Pacific Harbor Seal (Nollens et al., 2010) , Gammacoronavirus in the Beluga Whale J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008) and Gammacoronavirus in the Bottlenose Dolphin (Woo et al., 2014) .\n",
            " However, it must be noted that although these viruses are associated with respiratory diseases in pinnipeds and cetaceans, they are poorly similar to SARS-CoV-2 because both Gammacoronaviruses and Alphacoronaviruses share little homology with the new CoV. Wild birds are known to be viral reservoirs, and birds living in marine environment are also known to harbor CoVs. For example, a novel coronavirus, member of the Gammacoronaviruses, was identified in American herrings and great black backed gulls (Canuti et al., 2019) . Interestingly, these sea bird CoVs belong to the same clade of marine mammal CoVs, suggesting that a possible spillover between these animals has occurred. Marine Gammacoronaviruses have morphology, genome organization, and replication highly similar to human CoVs (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008; Woo et al., 2014) . While no marine Gammacoronavirus has been cultivated, experiments using the avian Gammacoronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) have shown that it shares with human CoVs similar entry, replication and shedding. Moreover, while it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 recognize the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its cellular receptor , IBV binds to sialic acid but, despite it infects primarily respiratory tissues, both they may have a wide cell tropism and can infect multiple sites (Winter et al., 2006; Promkuntod et al., 2014; Bande et al., 2016) .\n",
            " aquatic food animals or their products, highlighting that despite this virus is not a foodborne virus, it can survive on contaminated cold-chain food sources. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 does not replicate in cold blood organisms who have a different ACE2 cell receptor and therefore it is unlikely that human consumption of aquatic animals or their products can transmit SARS-CoV-2, as well as that marine CoVs that are neither zoonotic nor closely related to human CoVs can cross the species barrier.\n",
            " The COVID-19 pandemic is having an impressive impact on human society and activities forcing the The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the environment and the involvement of others animal species have been reviewed in this study. The presence and persistence of this virus in the environment, especially in aquatic environments, have been the subject of several studies. However, from the currently available J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f scientific evidences, it is possible to assume that due to the high decay rates and the high dilution rates, SARS-Cov-2 and CoVs in general are not able to persist in natural habitats for long time periods. This would minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection of any susceptible host that potentially could act as a viral reservoir. However, since terrestrial mammals and cetaceans have, similarly to humans, on ACE2 the receptor binding domains, surviving virions may potentially infect these animals especially near urban wastewater outfalls (Nabi and Khan, 2020) .\n",
            " In conclusion, CoVs as free persistent virions, especially in marine and freshwater ecosystems, are not frequent, but this could depend on the limited knowledge of the viral diversity in aquatic reservoirs (Mordecai and Hewson, 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020b) . Current understanding of the potential risk represented by the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in marine environments can be improved by a much broader monitoring and analysis of the dynamics of viral spread through further studies on this issue.\n",
            " Citizens around the world are making responsible efforts to reduce viral transmissions and preserve human health. The pandemic teaches us that the same commitment must be dedicated to protecting and preserving the health of the planet Earth. Choosing more sustainable actions for the planet represents the greatest challenge for the future of humanity. In this scenario, actions such as supporting the recovery and development of impacted communities, favoring the resilience of coastal ecosystems and safeguarding their services are strongly recommended (Steven et al., 2020 ; United Nations Environment Programme-Mediterranean Action Plan, 2020).\n",

Samples from receiving rivers (two sites, sampled in the same dates as wastewaters) showed in some cases a positivity to PCR amplification, probably due to non-treated discharges, or the combined sewage overflows. Nevertheless, also for rivers vitality was negligible, indicating the absence of sanitary risks. Aquatic food does not present the big danger to the human population as was initially feared due to the association of early outbreaks to seafood markets and indicate areas needing more research. 1\n",

            "Title: African perspectives: modern complexities of emerging, re-emerging, and endemic zoonoses\n",
            "Body Text: R ecent events have shown that public health, animal health and national economies have been threatened, globally, by the increased occurrence of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (ErEIDs) [1] . Specifically, land use change cum agricultural practices, surging human demographic, pathogen evolution (antimicrobial resistance), failure of public health systems, global travel and more global interconnectedness in spatial and temporal dimensions have driven these threats [2] . Other aggravating factors include: ecological changes, incursion into previously uninhabited areas, changes in human behavior, environmental degradation, international trade, technology and industry, antimicrobial misuse, and deficiencies in public health infrastructure and decision-making [1] [2] [3] . Major ErEIDs − including zoonoses − have been reported in the last two decades including: Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, Hendra, Nipah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1, H5N8 and H7N9 subtypes, West Nile fever, Pandemic H1N1 Influenza, Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Many of these diseases have been documented in Africa.\n",
            " In Africa, 47 of the 54 countries (87%) have reported ErEIDs to the WHO since 1997 ( Table 1) . While several initiatives have been implemented globally to accelerate progress toward a safer world [4] , it is yet not clear whether African countries are ready and capable of handling the magnitude and threats associated with ErEIDs [4] . Here, we reviewed plausible reasons and drivers for the upsurge of ErEIDs in Africa and proffer some mitigating measures.\n",
            " Human populations in African countries have rapidly increased in the last few decades (Figure 1 ). Population growth has occurred together with a substantial modification of human and pathogen behaviours [2, 4] . For example, Hoosegood has identified that societal behaviours eg, union formation and cohabitation, re-marriage and partnering, union instability-widowhood, divorce and separation, fertility and fecundity, and fertility-related decisions significantly impact on and are impacted by HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan regions particularly, in Southern Africa [5] . Second, urban growth has disrupted wildlife and pathogen ecology [1, 2] . As human-pathogen contacts increase, so does the probability for more outbreaks. Pathogens affected include cowpox, Lyme disease, Nipah, Hendra and Ebola viruses as well as the group named ESKAPE -which includes Enterococci, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and En-terobacteria-which explains between 45 and 77% of all African human mortalities [1, 3] . As human-pathogen contacts increase, so does the probability of more outbreaks.\n",
            " To prevent epidemics, it is needed to markedly improve public infrastructures, sanitation, and the health systems. For instance, the public and animal health surveillance systems must transform, so interventions occur within acceptable response times [1, 3, 4] .\n",
            " Third, in the 20 th century, the average temperature has increased approximately 0.7°C in the African continent. Climate change has predisposed Africa to highly vulnerable situations, particularly around internationally shared water resources. Consequently, new challenges have emerged, including: border-related conflicts, food security risk due to declines agricultural production, vectorand water-borne diseases, (especially in areas with inadequate health infrastructure), flooding and exacerbation of desertification by changes in rainfall and intensified land use [2] . Predictions related to water resources include: (a) decreased rainfalls in portions of the Sahel, (b) increased rainfalls in east central Africa, (c) increased temperature ranging from 0.2°C to >0.5°C per decade, especially in the semi-arid margins of the Sahara and central southern Africa [6] . Some studies have also suggested that major climate change will influence water resource use, natural resources management and biodiversity, human health, food security, resettlement and infrastructure re-allocation, and desertification [2, 6] . Variance in climatic conditions will impact significantly on disease ecology and epidemiology with upsurge in human-animal disease conditions due decreased salinity of the soil which can increase the number of toxic bacteria and breeding sites for mosquitoes and rodents.\n",
            " These challenges can have consequences on international trade and commerce. Since the liberalization of trade policies between countries over the past two decades, national economies have grown in leaps and bounds. While such policies have fast-tracked growth forecast for African countries, they also have augmented the risks of emergent and trans-boundary animal and human diseases especially associated with long flights, such zoonotic tuberculosis, influenza viruses, HIV/AIDS and cholera. Because trans-border movements of livestock and/or some commercial practices may bring together disease vectors and humans, human and animal health should be addressed together [1] [2] [3] .\n",
            " Fourthly, the rapid expansion in human populations (and consequently, the need to meet the food security needs) has warranted the intensification of animal and crop agriculture. These changes have converted previously fallow lands and forest into arable, agricultural and/or grazing lands. Associated with these changes are increased (a) rodents populations, (b) dispersal and redistributions of wild ruminants populations and their ectoparasites, (c) wildlife-livestock-human interactions, and (d) occurrence of diseases like Rift Valley Fever. Bodies of evidence have suggested that the rate of future zoonotic diseases will be closely linked to the evolution of the agriculture-environment nexus [1, 2] . It is suggested that, as long as Africa (or any other continent) does not address complex interactions -such as those that involve agriculture, the environment, economics, sociology, as well as zoonotic pathogens, disease outbreaks may follow human-driven disruptions, as those observed after major changes in land use, eg, those related with the construction of dams, mines, and intensive agriculture.\n",
            " The fact that pathogens have evolved and keep evolving should be emphasized. Microbes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have developed multiple resistance mechanisms due to excessive and long-term use of antimicrobials, genetic transfers of resistance genes and selective pressures [2, 3] . Endemic antimicrobial-resistant Africa will need to prioritize rapid detection, prompt response to ErEIDs, optimize the benefit of geospatial epidemiology in policy decisions and utilize interdisciplinary educational programs. ) . Intense human-animal interactions, and consumption of non-certified pathogen-free animal products facilitate the spread of zoonoses pathogens come with heavy clinical and economic burdens, especially in the developing countries. Recent review had indicated that endemic infections associated with antimicrobial resistance requires a particular attention because such diseases are linked with approximately 44 to 77% of all annual human deaths in Africa [3] . It has been estimated that, by 2050, more lives will be lost due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) than cancer [3] . One major component of antimicrobial resistance is the overuse of antimicrobials in the production of livestock, which are then passed to humans [3] . Because vaccines reduce the incidence of infectious diseases (and, therefore, antibiotic use), immunisations might reduce AMR [1, 3, 7] .\n",
            " Prevention and mitigations: given the numerous and serious issues here identified, African governments need to prioritize efforts aimed at rapid detection and prompt response to emerging or re-emerging pathogens. For example, the Critical Response Time (CRT or time available to implement effective epidemic control measures) should be considered in decision-making [1, 5] . That is so because for any intervention to be very effective (≈ 100%), it must be deployed under a realist timeframe; if it requires a longer period of time, it will necessarily be (i) less effective (if not ineffective), and (ii) more expensive [5] . CRT may or may not include geo-referenced data. When it lacks geographical data, it becomes much shorter, making useless almost any intervention. Thus, the real significance of CRT is that it should be expanded (giving decision-makers more time to complete interventions) − which can only be achieved when high-resolution geo-referenced epidemiologic data are analyzed in time and space. Thus, to achieve improved epidemic control measures, geographically explicit data should be collected from epidemics, analysed and lessons learnt made available for future interventions. Only such (local or regional) data can support scientifically valid decision-making. Yet, even recent epidemics have been addressed with ad hoc policies, such as the classic '3-km radius control rings' -which assume all epidemics (ie, all pathogens, all host species, and all local geographies) are identical [1] [2] [3] . Failure to consider local bio-geo-epidemiological information has led to widespread dissemination of major epidemics, such as Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone [8] .\n",
            " Infectious diseases and zoonoses are extremely expensive to nations both clinically and economically, for example a recent valuation had estimated such costs to include: SARS in Asia and Canada (US$ 30-50 billion), HPAI H5N1 globally (US$ 30 billion), worldwide influenza H1N1 (US$ 45-55 billion), Ebola in West Africa (US$ 10 billion) and Zika in Latin America and the Caribbean (US$ 7-18 billion) [9] , promptly delivered pre-emptive actions and control measures, as well as targeted interventions can significantly reduce burdens associated with these diseases.\n",
            " The creation of interdisciplinary educational programs aimed at local and regional decision-makers involved in disease diagnosis, dissemination, and control, is recommended. Such programs could develop and integrate: (i) local data on antimicrobial resistance, (ii) high-resolution, local geo-referenced data, and (iii) site-specific control measures that can be implemented within biologically valid critical response times.\n",

            "Body Text: environmental changes, new and recurring diseases are likely to continue to emerge.\n",
            " The effects of zoonoses on human health and economics have recently been underscored by notable outbreaks such as those involving Nipah virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV). A recent retrospective study of 335 emerging infectious episodes over a 64-year period emphasized the role of wildlife as a source of emerging infections. However, research efforts have typically been focused toward either humans or economically related species (1) .\n",
            " The frequency of these events increased substantially over the period of investigation (2) . Such infections are now often perceived as agents of biologic warfare rather than infections with a long but insidious history in their appropriate ecologic niche. Why then are these infections becoming a serious public health concern? The answer is a complex multifactorial set of changing circumstances. To support the growing human population, we have an increasing demand for nutritional support, resulting in intensive agricultural practices, sometimes involving enormous numbers of animals, or multiple species farmed within the same region. These practices can facilitate infection to cross species barriers.\n",
            " Additionally, we are witnessing increasing globalization, with persons (3), animals, and their products (4) moving around the world. This movement enables unprecedented spread of infections at speeds that challenge the most stringent control mechanisms. Furthermore, continual encroachment of humans into natural habitats by population expansion or tourism brings humans into new ecologic environments and provides opportunity for novel zoonotic exposure. Climatic changes have facilitated the expansion of compatible conditions for some disease vectors, remodeling dynamics for potentially new, emerging, and reemerging zoonoses (5) . In the next 2 decades, climate change will be the most serious issue that dominates reemergence of pathogens into new regions.\n",
            " Climate change also effects evolution of pathogens, and where relevant, their vectors. Continual mutation and recombination events give rise to variants with altered levels of fi tness to persist and spread. Changing ecologic circumstances and pathogen diversity can give rise to variants with altered pathogenic potential. However, the host must not be ignored. Increased longevity and therapies for persons with diseases can modulate host susceptibility and concomitant infections and upset the evolving and dynamic infection balance.\n",
            " Data for this review were identifi ed in PubMed searches and relevant journal articles and excluded those studies not published in English. Emerging or reemerging pathogens must be considered on multiple levels. First, pathogens not previously known have been identifi ed. For example, alteration in the processing of cattle feed in the United Kingdom resulted in extended host range and emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle (6) . Similarly, mixing of multiple species under stressful conditions can promote a species jump such as that witnessed with SARS-CoV (7) . New opportunities can be created by climatic changes such as global warming and ecologic alterations facilitated through changed land use and movements of infected hosts, susceptible animals, or disease vectors. In 1987 In , 1997 In -1998 , outbreaks of infection with Rift Valley fever virus in Africa were associated with changes in river fl ow and fl ooding resulting from damming of rivers or heavy rainfall. Many zoonotic pathogens fall into the category of generalist agents exhibiting extensive host diversity, e.g., Coxiella burnetii, the etiologic agent of Q fever. This bacterium can successfully infect hosts ranging from domestic animals to wildlife, reptiles, fi sh, birds, and ticks.\n",
            " Others agents have restricted specifi c transmission dynamics because of limited host ranges. These agents include simian immunodefi ciency viruses 1 and 2, which are found in chimpanzees and sooty mangabees, and Rift Valley virus, which is transmitted by Aedes spp. and Culex spp. mosquitoes and found in sheep and goats. For many zoonotic agents, the potential to cause infection in accidental hosts, such as humans, exists, but often this represents a dead-end host. Pathogens such as Anaplasma spp., Erhlichia spp., Rickettsia spp., Bartonella spp., West Nile virus, and rabies virus can be included in this group.\n",
            " From an epidemiologic point of view, \"A reservoir should be defi ned as one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which a pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defi ned target species\" (8) . Conversely, some zoonoses in specifi c conditions show remarkable ability for human-to-human transmission beyond the confi nes of natural sylvatic cycles. This ability was seen during a recent outbreak of plague among diamond miners in the Congo. This outbreak was initiated by an infection of a miner, which became pneumonic and resulted in 136 secondary cases of pneumonic plague and 57 deaths (9) . Transmission of plague is complex and dynamic, with combinations of stochastic and adaptive mechanisms. As seen in this example, rapid transmission often occurs, but this is accompanied by slower, localized transmission among enzootic reservoir species, which often use vector-borne expansion among low-density hosts (10) . Other zoonoses, given correct circumstances, can result in human-to-human transmission. These zoonoses include those that cause Ebola fever, infl uenza A, plague, tularemia, and SARS (11) .\n",
            " New or emerging virulence traits can evolve and result in large-scale transmission and concomitant alteration of pathogenicity. This new pathogenicity may include increased invasiveness, enhanced spread, toxin production, or antimicrobial drug resistance. Y. pestis has shown a resurgence in regions such as Madagascar, with isolates showing a marked increase in resistance to antimicrobial agents (12) . Similarly, a recently evolved outer surface protein A serotype of a Lyme borreliosis spirochete (Borrelia garinii serotype 4), has shown particularly aggressive tendencies and is often associated with hyperinvasive infection (13) . Concern has also been noted about increasingly frequent isolation of Corynebacterium ulcerans carrying the diphtheria toxigenic phage.\n",
            " Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation, on which natural selection, genetic drift, gene fl ow, and recombination act to shape the genetic structure of populations. This factor is especially notable in viruses, which have relatively small genomes and short generation times, particularly among viruses with more error-prone RNA genomic replication (14) . However, most mutations are deleterious and under pressure of innate and adaptive host immunity, viruses probably always experience selection for mutation rates >0. The upper limit on mutation rates will be determined by factors such as natural selection, genomic architecture, and the ability to avoid loss of viability or genetic information, albeit, that a loss of genetic information and increased specialization is observed in co-evolution with a host (15) .\n",
            " According to evolutionary theory, higher mutation rates should be favored in a changing environment, such as altered host immune defenses. However, in experimental settings, artifi cially increased mutation rates are often associated with lower virus titers. In addition, a complex relationship exists between underlying mutational dynamics and the ability to generate antigenic variation, which in turn has serious implications for the epidemiologic potential of the virus.\n",
            " Evolutionary changes are not always a prerequisite for viral emergence in a new host. Some viruses (e.g., poxviruses), have a wide host range and show a relatively low mutation rate. However, in other viruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, evolutionary change is essential for effi cient infection and transmission to new hosts (16) . Because most viruses replicate poorly when transferred to new hosts, greater variation is more likely to assist viral adaptation to its new host.\n",
            " All too frequently, the diagnosis of zoonotic disease is delayed through lack of clinical suspicion or failure to obtain adequate clinical histories. Some zoonotic infections are unusual (e.g., scabies infection after handling of pet guinea pigs). Other infections may have a less obvious animal link. Mowing lawns is believed to be a risk factor for acquiring tularemia (caused by Francisella tularensis) in disease-endemic areas where lagomorph reservoirs may be killed by mowers or hedge trimmers (17) .\n",
            " For some infections, zoonotic transmission occurs indirectly through food. Human brucellosis is not usually acquired through animal contact but is transmitted more often by consumption of infected animal products such as unpasteurized dairy products (18) . Salmonella spp. have repeatedly caused outbreaks of salmonellosis after persons have eaten uncooked eggs (19) . Hepatitis E virus has been transmitted through consumption of uncooked deer meat (20) .\n",
            " Exposure routes may be airborne, as demonstrated for several outbreaks of Q fever (21) . An ongoing airborne Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands related to goat farming has raised awareness of this previously neglected zoonosis (22) . How humans were exposed to these animals would not have been apparent; the exposures were identifi ed by epidemiologic mapping of the distribution of cases. These examples underscore the necessity of gathering comprehensive patient data to effectively diagnose zoonoses.\n",
            " Sporting activities can expose humans to zoonotic infections. Hunting wildlife has been associated with infections such as brucellosis and tularemia (23) . Less obvious routes arise from activities such as water sports. Leptospira spp.-infected animals excrete viable organisms in their urine, which can persist in aquatic environments for prolonged periods. After a triathlon event in 1998, a total of 52 of 474 athletes tested were diagnosed with leptospirosis (24) . Suspicion of water sport-related infections with hepatitis A and Leptospira spp. led to closure of an area of Bristol, United Kindom, where docks were used for recreational water activities (25) .\n",
            " Horses are now moved from countries in Europe to warmer regions (e.g., United Arab Emirates) to prolong the racing season during the winter. Hunting activities have promoted large-scale export of animals such as hares (possible reservoirs of tularemia and brucellosis) from Poland and the movement of potentially rabies-infected raccoons in the United States. In other countries such as the United Kingdom, pheasants are bred and released for shooting in the fall and provide plentiful hosts for questing ticks and increasing their abundance. Importation of pheasants into the United Kingdom from France was associated with introduction of a mild zoonotic infection (Newcastle virus disease) in 2007 (26) .\n",
            " Companion animals have many forms of contact and opportunities to transmit multiple zoonoses. The sexual stage of the life cycle of Toxoplasma spp. occurs in cats, thus exposing humans to infection in situations in which hygienic measures have not been observed. Cats also serve as reservoir for Bartonella henselae, the etiologic agent of cat-scratch fever (27) . Cowpox virus can also be transmitted to humans by contact with cats (28) . Animal bites can result in zoonotic infections, typifi ed by infection with Pasteurella multocida. Even in the absence of a bite, contact with animals (e.g., licking of wounds) can result in infection. More recently, attention has focused on transmission of Rickettsia felis into the human environment by cat fl eas (29) .\n",
            " Dogs are the most likely source when humans become infected with rabies virus and are potential sources of Toxocara spp. This emerging threat is becoming apparent with importation of rescued dogs and global movement of dogs with their owners, which has resulted in several cases of leishmaniasis in the absence of sand fl y vectors. Dogs can be a source of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and could play a role in zoonotic spread of genetic elements responsible for antimicrobial drug resistance (30) . Contact with dogs in Mediterranean regions has been implicated as a likely source of infection in recent cases of Mediterranean spotted fever reported in traveling humans (31) .\n",
            " Cats and dogs can introduce plague or rabies into human environments and have been associated with Q fever in humans and dermatophytosis (ringworm). Scavenger habits of these animals bring them into contact with many zoonotic agents, and close living relationships with humans such as sharing meal plates or beds offer many opportunities for disease transmission.\n",
            " Pet rats have recently been incriminated as the source of Leptospira icterrohemoragiae infection in their owners. Psittacine birds are an established risk factor for acquisition of Chlamydophila psittaci. During recent years, the market for exotic pets has greatly increased. This increase has resulted in transmission of several unusual organisms, such as exotic Salmonella spp., which are often associated with pet reptiles. Media attention was captured after an outbreak of monkeypox in America that affected >70 persons in 2003. After infected African rodents had been imported for the pet trade, the infection spread into native North American black-tailed prairie dogs and was subsequently disseminated among humans (32) .\n",
            " Zoonotic diseases associated with hunting and eating wildlife is of increasing global concern. Bush meat is considered a delicacy by many and has resulted in its growth as a commercial enterprise. Tracking, capturing, handling, butchering in the fi eld, and transporting of carcasses involve risks of cross-species transmission. Particularly high risks are associated with hunting nonhuman primates. The act of butchering is a greater risk factor for acquiring bloodborne pathogens than transporting, selling, and eating the butchered meat (33) .\n",
            " Zoonotic pathogens from wildlife may infect humans with little or no human-to-human transmission (e.g., avian infl uenza virus and Hendra virus). Alternatively, increased travel or migration and increased between-person contacts have facilitated emergence of simian immunodefi ciency virus/HIV/AIDS in Africa. Increased exposure to wildcaught animals and high mutation rates of many RNA viruses have increased their predominance among emerging zoonoses transmitted from human to human; RNA viruses from bush meat may therefore play a possible role in future disease emergence.\n",
            " Large-scale movement of persons, livestock, food, or goods is now commonplace and provides increasing opportunities for rapid spread of pathogens. Trichinellae in horsemeat have been transported across the Pacifi c Ocean and infected consumers in other parts of the world. Discarded tires provide new habitats for mosquitoes in addition to their usual ecologic niches. The World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organisation implement strict control of animal movement. Transport of animals can result in mingling of different species in crowded and stressful conditions. This mingling can suppress immune responses to persistent infections and increase pathogen shedding. Under such circumstances, susceptible species can readily become infected (34) .\n",
            " Tourism has exponentially increased in recent years. This fi nding has resulted in increasing numbers of imported zoonoses, such as a variety of rickettsial spotted fevers, brucellosis, melioidosis, genotype I hepatitis E (35), tickborne encephalitis (36) , and schistosomiasis (37) .A rapid increase in cases of African tick bite fever has been associated with travelers to sub-Saharan Africa and the eastern Caribbean. This disease, which is caused by R. africae, is transmitted by a particularly aggressive Amblyomma sp. tick; >350 imported cases have been observed in recent years (31) . Infection sequalae, such as subacute neuropathy, may be found long after travel when tick bite fever eschars have disappeared (37) . An estimated >1 million international journeys are made each day, and a staggering 700 million tourists travel on an annual basis. Detailed travel histories of patients who show clinical signs and symptoms of disease are needed.\n",
            " Deforestation and development of natural habitats have been seen on a global scale to accommodate intensifi cation of agriculture and living areas for humans. As a result, eco-logic habitats have been disrupted, reservoir abundance has changed, and transmission dynamics have been altered. Reduced host abundance may force vectors to seek alternative hosts, increasing opportunities for disease transmission, as demonstrated by increases in human cases of Lyme borreliosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fevers, and anaplasmosis. Development of forests to provide rubber plantations in Malaysia has been correlated with increases in schistosomiasis (37) . Wildlife may modify feeding practices as a consequence of changing land use, bringing them closer to humans and livestock. This modifi cation was suggested to have been instrumental in the Nipah virus outbreak that affected pigs and humans in Malaysia in 1999. Nipah virus persists as a serious problem in many rural areas of Bangladesh and India, where infected bats living near human dwellings, urinate in date palm sap, which is later consumed raw by humans (38) .\n",
            " Human population growth has been associated with reshaping of population demographics. Increasing from 1 billion at the beginning of the 20th century to 6 billion by the end of the century, current predictions forecast a human population of ≈10 billion by 2050. This prediction is accompanied by a staggering increase in urbanization of the population from 39% in urban environments in 1980 to 46% in 1997 and a predicted 60% by 2030. This highdensity clustering of the human population paves the way for potential outbreaks on an immense scale (5) .\n",
            " Many areas are now experiencing a reemergence of zoonotic pathogens, partly resulting from collapse of public health programs during political upheavals. Often, these areas increasingly appeal to those seeking adventurous or unusual holiday destinations.\n",
            " Delay in development of clinical signs and often insidious onset can challenge appropriate diagnosis and patient management. Furthermore, movements of animals used for agricultural trade, sport, and as companions also offer opportunities for further dissemination of infections. Brucellosis-free countries have seen reintroductions associated with movement of infected livestock. Movement of pets throughout Europe has been associated with an alarming increase in diseases such as leishmaniasis. Moreover, pets can harbor ectoparasites such as ticks, fl eas, and lice. All of these parasites, especially ticks, are notorious vectors of multiple zoonotic agents.\n",
            " We are at risk for airborne transmission of zoonoses by many factors (e.g., from travel to farms, consumption of food, and mowing the lawn, which as been associated with tularemia). Visiting petting farms or having family pets increases the likelihood of potential zoonotic infections, especially if pets are exotic. Water sports may increase the risk for acquiring leptospirosis. Wilderness camping activities have been associated with hantavirus infection after inhalation of aerosolized urine excretions of rodents. Other sporting activities such as hunting have been associated with brucellosis and tularemia. Travel to other countries opens a range of new potential zoonotic exposures through direct contact or indirectly through fomites, food, or arthropod vectors. Increasingly exotic locations are being sought with associated exotic zoonoses. Some tourists consume local delicacies, such as aborted animal fetuses in Ecuador, which are a source of brucellosis (39) .\n",
            " Many zoonoses can be considered opportunistic infections. Increasing demands for protein necessitate increased levels of farming. Food can provide a vehicle for spread of pathogens from animals to humans. Contact with animals during farming, hunting, or by animal bites can increase transmission of diseases (e.g., rabies and tularemia). Arthropod vectors can transmit diseases on an immense scale to other hosts as in cases of West Nile fever and plague.\n",
            " Changing patterns of farming, life style, and transportation infl uence the dynamics of pathogen ecology. Pathogens are subjected to changes by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Mutation, recombination, selection, and deliberate manipulation can result in new traits acquired by pathogens and result in potential epidemic consequences.\n",
            " Reemergence of diseases through opportunistic host switching is likely to continue as a major source of human infectious disease. Strategies to improve public health have focused on improved surveillance in regions of perceived high likelihood of disease (reemergence). These strategies include improved detection of pathogens in reservoirs, early outbreak detection, broad-based research to identify factors that favor reemergence, and effective control (i.e., quarantine and improved hygiene) (40) .\n",
            " To recognize and combat zoonotic diseases, the epidemiology of these infections must be understood. We need to identify pathogens, their vertebrate hosts, and their methods of transmission. Identifi cation should include knowledge of spatiotemporal disease patterns and their changes over time. These features can be used to identify dynamic processes involved in pathogen transmission (Figure) , which can be used to account for observed disease patterns and ultimately forecast spread and establishment into new areas.\n",
            " Armed with information on expected disease patterns, we can address whether change has occurred beyond that which would normally be expected. However, this analysis may not be suitably responsive to control new and emerging zoonoses. Improved detection may be achieved through use of syndromic approaches rather than searching for specifi c pathogens.\n",
            " Human disease surveillance must be associated with enhanced longitudinal veterinary surveillance in food-producing animals and wildlife. Prompt detection and instigation of control measures such as vaccination are pivotal to prevent disease spread. Novel molecular methods (e.g., DNA microarrays) offer unprecedented opportunities for rapid detection. However, these methods require optimization and validation before they can be used in routine microbiology laboratories. Cloned antigens or attenuated vaccines can be rapidly modifi ed into appropriate antigenic forms. However, for identifi cation of specifi c pathogens, more research will be needed to provide timely management of a new or emerging disease threat.\n",
            " Approaches for identifi cation of pathogen replication in vectors are more likely to offer substantial benefi ts for control of zoonoses. These methods are inappropriate for human vaccines, which must adhere to stricter legislative criteria. However, control of zoonotic infections in reservoir hosts has a pronounced protective effect in human populations. Use and development of antiviral drugs are other useful possibilities, but these drugs are likely to be too expensive for use in large disease outbreaks and emergence of drug resistance may result in concomitant loss of therapeutic options for these agents.\n",
            " We do not know which zoonosis will be the next serious public health threat. However, as we increase efforts to improve the capacity to respond to this pathogen, we will also increase the likelihood that we can effi ciently and effectively respond to new, reemerging, or neglected zoonoses in the future.

            "Body Text: Microorganisms are the unicellular or multicellular organisms, which include bacteria, archaea, viruses, protists, and fungi (Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012; Sommer and Bäckhed, 2013) . Microbes sometimes can protect the human body from lethal pathogens, improve metabolism, and strengthen the immune system of the host (Ventura et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, the imbalance of the microbial community may cause a wide range of human diseases, such as obesity (Zhang et al., 2009) , diabetes (Wen et al., 2008) , rheumatoid arthritis (Lynch and Pedersen, 2016) , and even cancer (Schwabe and Jobin, 2013) .\n",
            " As a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has caused an unprecedented public health crisis recently. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 with the enhanced transmissibility are emerging globally. Traditional drug development could not keep pace with threats from the fast-spreading SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, because of the complexity, high cost, and long experiment period of the traditional drug discovery process. The world needs to speed up the drug discovery process for With the recent development of deep learning, especially the graph neural networks, more and more researchers have begun to try to find solutions based on the deep learning for their biological problems (Shamshirband et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021) , such as drug interaction identification (Deng et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020) , protein function prediction (Gligorijević et al., 2021) , virus classification (Deif et al., 2021) , and disease-genes association prediction (Shu et al., 2021) , etc. These studies show the potential of graph representation learning in biological questions.\n",
            " In the research on microorganisms, there is a large amount of known information about the action of microorganisms and drugs, the genetic information of microorganisms, and the molecular formula information of small molecule drugs. We can use calculation-based methods to process these data to predict the possibility of interaction between microorganisms and drugs. This prediction allows us to initially screen out related therapeutic drugs for microorganisms that cause diseases, thereby speeding up the development of specific drugs for related diseases.\n",
            " For microbial-drug association prediction, there are also several reported methods based on the graph representation algorithms. For example, Zhu et al. (2019) propose a method to predict human microbe-drug association, which is named Human Microbe-Drug Association by KATZ measure (HMDAKATZ). HMDAKATZ predicts possible drug-microbe associations using chemical similarity of drugs based on the Gaussian kernel similarity. Long et al. propose a Heterogeneous Network Embedding Representation framework for Microbe-Drugs Association prediction (HNERMDA) (Long and Luo, 2020) . HNERMDA predicts drug-microbe association by heterogeneous graph neural network. Long et al. proposed a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based framework for predicting human microbe-drug associations, named GCNMDA (Long et al., 2020a) . GCNMDA predicts drugmicrobe association by introducing microbial protein interaction and chemical similarity of drugs. Long et al. propose a framework of heterogeneous graph attention networks to predict the association between drug and microbe (HGATDVA) (Long et al., 2020b) . HGATDVA predicts drug-microbe associations by introducing a network of protein interactions between drug targets and microbial hosts. All of these previously reported methods first construct a heterogeneous network with microorganisms and drugs as nodes and then use some network representation methods to get the feature vectors of nodes in the heterogeneous network. For the prediction of the potential association between microorganisms and drugs, a common approach is to first build an action network with a variety of biological information, such as the interaction network between microorganisms and drugs. Then, the graph representation learning algorithm is used to learn node vector representation from the biological interaction network. Finally, the node representation vector obtained by the algorithm is used to predict the probability of potential association between microorganisms and drugs.\n",
            " Human Microbe-Drug Association by KATZ measure is the first algorithm used to predict potential links between microbes and drugs. In this method, the graph kernel similarity of microorganisms was calculated based on the known conditions to construct the microbial similarity network. Then, the drug similarity network was constructed according to the chemical structure similarity of drugs. By integrating the existing data of microbiota and drug association, a biological network with microbe and drug can be obtained. The KATZ algorithm was then used on this biological network to predict potential associations between microbes and drugs. HNERMDA is a method based on metapath2vec (Dong et al., 2017) to learn the node representation vector of microorganisms and drugs. By constructing an interaction network between microorganisms and drugs, it utilizes metapath2vec to learn their node representation vectors. Then, in the downstream prediction task, the bipartite graph recommendation algorithm with bias is used to predict the potential association between microorganisms and drugs. GCNMDA is a method that uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) (Kipf and Welling, 2017) to learn node representation in heterogeneous biological networks composed of microorganisms and drugs, obtaining node representation vectors of microorganisms and drugs for the downstream prediction of potential drugs. Host protein information was introduced into the HGATDVA to construct two heterogeneous biological networks: One is a biological network composed of two isomeric nodes of microorganism and drug, and the other is a biological network composed of three isomeric nodes of microorganism, host protein, and drug. During node representation learning, graph attention networks (GAT) (Velickovic et al., 2018) were used to learn network representation of two biological networks, respectively, and two sets of node representation vectors were obtained. The node representation vectors of the two groups of microorganisms and drugs were added to predict the potential association between microorganisms and drugs. In the follow-up prediction of the association between microorganism and drug, the operation is carried out on these node feature vectors. Therefore, a good node feature can make our prediction result more accurate.\n",
            " In the previously reported studies on the prediction of microbe-drug association, different graph representation learning algorithms are mainly used to improve the prediction performance. With the development of graph neural networks, there are more and more graph representation algorithms with better performance, such as GCN, GAT, heterogeneous graph attention networks (HANs) (Wang et al., 2019) , and heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) (Hu et al., 2020) , etc.\n",
            " In this article, we propose a model incorporating two attention mechanisms into a GCN to enhance the performance of graph characterization algorithms, thereby improving the performance of microbial-drug association prediction. In terms of relevant evaluation indicators, our model is better than the relevant benchmarks. In this case study, we predicted four SARS-CoV-2related drugs on the relevant dataset through the trained model and verified the effectiveness of two of them in the latest database. The entire network is composed of three subnetworks, namely, the interaction network between drugs and drugs, the interaction network between microorganisms, and the associated network between drugs and microorganisms. (B) Graph neural networks of two attentional mechanisms. Through the graph convolution operation on the node feature and the graph structure and the feature projection of the fully connected function, the projection of the three-node features can be obtained, which can be used to calculate the attention weight matrix between nodes and the node feature of attention between feature components, so as to calculate the final node representation features. (C) Prediction of potential associations between microorganisms and drugs. Through the inner product of the learned node representations, the prediction score between the drug feature and microbe feature can be obtained, so as to determine whether there is an association between the node pair.\n",
            " We divide the information in the network into three levels of information. The first is the information inside the node. Generally speaking, entities such as drugs and microbes are abstracted into nodes in the network. To distinguish different nodes, unique features are assigned to nodes, namely, feature vectors of nodes in the network structure. The second is the information between nodes, the edges in the network. Finally, there is edge-to-edge information, the meta-path in the network.\n",
            " The attention mechanism was first proposed in the field of natural language processing; that is, we can assign different weights to different word vectors. GAT is the earliest method to introduce an attention mechanism in the field of graph neural networks. It assigns different weights to different adjacency features in the stage of information aggregation. This kind of attention is not global attention, but only the attention between first-order neighbor nodes. HAN is an attention-based model for heterogeneous networks, which proposes two attention mechanisms: one is node-level attention, the other is attention between different meta-paths. First, feature vectors from different adjacent points are aggregated on each meta-path by the attention mechanism, and then, feature vectors from each source path are aggregated by assigning different weights to each metapath. Node-level attention in HAN is still the attention of local nodes, whereas attention between meta-paths is indirect global attention. But this approach relies heavily on setting up the meta-path. HGT is an improved approach to GCN that brings attention to message aggregation by introducing query vectors and key vectors. There are also two attention mechanisms in HGT, namely, attention between local nodes and attention between meta-paths.\n",
            " However, the existing graph neural networks with attention mechanisms are all based on the local nodes; that is, the attention weight is only allocated between the source node and its neighbors. Due to the limitation of the network structure, the attention information between the source node and its higherorder neighbors is not calculated.\n",
            " In view of the problems in the above methods, we propose two attention mechanisms, namely, the attention mechanism between all nodes and the attention mechanism between feature components within nodes. Through this new attentionbased graph neural network, better node feature vectors for predicting microbial-drug association can be obtained. The whole prediction process is shown in Figure 1 . Through nodeattention, we can get the attention of one node in the graph to the nodes of the whole graph. Through feature-attention, we can get the weight of each dimension between feature vectors of a node.\n",
            " The prediction process is to first build a heterogeneous network with drug nodes and microbial nodes. In this network, there are microbial-microbial, microbial-drug, and drug-drug interactions. We mainly predict the potential association between microbial-drug interaction. Then, node-attention and featureattention mechanisms are used to learn node representation on the network. Finally, after the representation vectors of the two heterogeneous nodes were obtained, they were directly used to predict the link between drugs and microorganisms.\n",
            " The network representation algorithm is divided into three parts: node-attention, feature-attention, multi-layer feature fusion.\n",
            " Considering the sequence data, in which a single word is used as a data unit and connected together, we can think of sequence data as a special kind of graph structure, which can be regarded as a graph structure in which the in and out degrees of all nodes are 1. Different from GAT's node-attention mechanism, we also have a weight for higher-order neighbor nodes. Therefore, the advantage of using such global node-attention is that we can aggregate the node information of higher-order neighbors by calculating selfattention, instead of being limited to the structure of the graph to capture the information of other nodes.\n",
            " Suppose there exists graph G, which can be represented by its adjacency matrix A and node feature matrix X, namely, G = (A, X). For the nodes in graph G, we can calculate their weights and then aggregate the information based on the weights. Different from graph convolution operation, graph convolution operation aggregates information according to the graph structure. When aggregating information according to weight, it can break through the limitation of graph structure and aggregate corresponding information even when there is no edge connection between nodes (refer to Figure 1B) .\n",
            " In this paragraph, we will introduce some commonly used formulas in the following text, such as GCN, Linear. GCN is a neural network layer that can learn the structure information of graph structure data. The calculation method is shown in Formula (1)\n",
            " which X is the original feature, ReLU is activation function, W is the learnable parameter matrix, andÃ is the adjacency matrix with self-loop of the graph. Linear is a fully connected function, and its formula is shown in (2)\n",
            " which X is the original feature, and W and b are learnable parameter matrix.\n",
            " Our method is mainly based on the idea that GCN learns the structural information of the network and triplet attention learns the disconnect node interaction information. First, we aggregate node features in GCN, and after learning the structural information of the network, treat all nodes as sequence data and temporarily ignore their structural information, as shown in Formula (3) (σ is non-linear activation function, like ReLU).\n",
            " By using Formula (1), we can obtain the features of three groups of nodes needed to calculate triplet attention. Q Node , K Node , and V Node . As shown in Formulas (4-6).\n",
            " Then, the node weight matrix W Node (N × N) is obtained from its inner product, and its row direction is normalized, as shown in Formulas (7, 8).\n",
            " Finally, the inner product of weight matrix W Node (N × N) and V Node (N × F) is integrated to obtain the node feature matrix X Node (N × F), as shown in Formula (9).\n",
            " In this process, we model the information of interaction between nodes in the whole network by calculating a node weight matrix W Node (N × N) . The node weight matrix W Node (N × N) is different from the adjacency matrix of the network A (N × N), which can be regarded as the n power of the adjacency matrix A (N × N),namely, W Node (N × N) = A n (N × N) and the n varies according to the size of the structure of the network.\n",
            " The graph can be represented by the node set V and the edge set E, as well as the node eigenmatrix X (N × F) For any node N i ∈ V, node N i can be represented by a node feature vector f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , · · · , f n . For a certain node N i , we can express the importance of different features by feature weight vectors (w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , · · · , w n ), and distribute feature weights by inner product. In other words, for different nodes, there is always some feature components f i , where i ∈ 1, 2, 3, · · · , n. In the dimension of f i , this node is significantly different from other nodes. For some other feature components f j , the values of all nodes are almost the same, so we need to give different weight values to these two different feature components. We use a feature component attention weight matrix to model the relationship between feature components within such nodes, as shown in the Figure 1B .\n",
            " Just as in the calculation of node-attention, three feature vector matrices corresponding to node-features, query, key, and value, are first calculated. The difference lies in that we calculate the weight between node feature components through query FIGURE 2 | Multi-layer concatenates. For each node-attention and feature-attention, the node information has different structural information. By fusing the features of each layer of nodes based on the two attention mechanisms, it can effectively use these node features integrating different structural information.\n",
            " and key feature vector matrix, that is, attention weight matrix belonging to feature components, as shown in Formula (10)\n",
            " It should be noted that the node weight matrix is W Node (N × N) and the feature component weight matrix is W Feature (F × F).\n",
            " After the matrix W Feature (F × F) is obtained, the final W Feature (F × F) is obtained through the normalization of the column direction, as shown in Formula (10). Then, the final feature vector of nodes is obtained by Formula (11, 12) w ·j = Softmax w ·j , j ∈ (0, 1, 2, . . . , n) (11)\n",
            " Generally speaking, GCN can only aggregate information to first-order neighbors of the source node, whereas aggregation to higher-order information requires the number of layers of stacked GCN. For GCN with different layers, the node information represented by GCN is obtained by aggregating the node information within the scope of different graph structures, and these node feature vectors have different structural semantic information. By integrating the node information obtained from these different GCN layers, better results can be obtained for link prediction. For example, in jump-knowledge networks (Xu et al., 2018) , node features from different GCN layers are added or spliced as the final node features. It is worth noting that jump-knowledge networks simply add up the node information learned from GCN of different layers and serve as the final node information. Suppose that for graph G (A, X), after n layer message aggregation, a list of node features (X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , · · · ,X n ) will be obtained. The feature vector matrix in this list represents the node features obtained by integrating the substructure information of different graphs. We use triple-based attention to assign different weights to these node features and then fuse them for downstream tasks. We give a schematic diagram of node features obtained by three-layer GNN, as shown in Figure 2 . Specifically, for each set of node features, we use the following formulas to calculate, Q i = σ (Linear (X i )) , i ∈ (1, 2, · · · , n) (13)\n",
            " After calculating the Q i , K i , and V i corresponding to each group of node features, the final feature vector X i of the group of nodes can be calculated by Formula (16)\n",
            " Finally, by concatenating multiple sets of node features, the final node feature X can be gain by Formula (17), which can be used to predict the score.\n",
            " X = X 1 X 2 · · · X n (17)\n",
            " After getting the final feature vector X of the microbe node and the drug node, the prediction score between a certain microbe and the drug node pair can be calculated, that is, the probability of the correlation between the microbe and the drug, as shown in Formula (18)\n",
            " where X u ∈ R 1 × n , X u ∈ R 1 × n, and Sigmoid is an activation function. During the training process, we use binary cross-entropy as our loss function for training, as shown in Formula (19) loss = (u,v)∈pos,neg BCE(S (u,v) , A (u,v) ),\n",
            " while A is the adjacency matrix, and (u, v) ∈ pos means A (u,v) = 1, and (u, v) ∈ neg means A (u,v) = 0.\n",
            " In the experiment, we used data coming from three datasets: DrugVirus (Andersen et al., 2020) , MDAD (Sun et al., 2018) , and aBiofilm (Rajput et al., 2018) . We integrated the data of these three datasets after removing duplicate microorganisms and drugs. By calculating the similarity of drug structure, and taking the drug interaction with similarity greater than 0.5 as the relationship between drugs, the drug interaction network is obtained. Similarly, the microbial similarity is calculated through the microbial gene sequence, and the microbial similarity greater than 0.5 is taken as the microbial association to obtain the microbial interaction network. The data used in our experiment are shown in Tables 1, 2. \n",
            " To verify the effectiveness of our method, we divided the dataset by 5-fold cross-validation of the data related to the known microorganisms a drug and randomly divided the data related to the known microorganisms and drugs into five groups.\n",
            " In each fold experiment, we take turns to select a group of related data as the test set, and the remaining four groups as the training set for training. In addition, because in the real world, it is more common that there is no interaction between microorganisms and drugs. At the same time, to compare the performance of each model in the case of unbalanced positive and negative samples, we set the number of negative samples in the experiment set to four. In our model, we set that the learning rate in optimization algorithm was 0.001 with Adam optimizer, and other related hyperparameters, such as the number of model layers, feature dimensions, and training times, are described in the ablation experiments. The equipment used in the experiment is Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4114 CPU @ 2.20 GHz, running memory is 128 GB, hard disk storage space is 10TB, and it is equipped with two Tesla P40 GPU with a total memory capacity of 48 GB.\n",
            " The comparative models we used are GCN, GAT, HAN, HGT, GCNMDA, and GraphSAINT . The hyperparameters of the benchmark model are set according to their papers. The experimental results are shown in Table 3 . ROC curves of the models are shown in Figure 3 .\n",
            " Area under the curve (AUC) is an index to measure the sorting performance. It is not sensitive to the balance of positive and negative samples. When the samples are unbalanced, it can also make a reasonable evaluation, which is suitable for measuring the sorting task. The closer of the result is to 1, the better performance it is.\n",
            " Area under the PR curve (AUPR) is the area value under the curve composed of recall rate and accuracy rate in the prediction results. It is generally used to measure the performance of correct prediction results in the dataset with unbalanced positive and negative samples.\n",
            " Under a single index, the bold one is the best model, and the underlined one is the second-best model. It can be seen that the performance of our model under AUC evaluation index is ahead of state-of-the-art baseline GraphSAINT. Our model achieves an AUC of 0.9721, better than GraphSAINT, which is 0.9653. Under the evaluation index of AUPR, the performance of our model is significantly ahead of other models. Compared with state-of-the-art baseline GraphSAINT (0.8938), our model (0.9102) has increased by about 1.74%, which is better than GCN (0.8721), GAT (0.8479), HAN (0.8086), HGT (0.8275), and GCNMDA (0.8796).\n",
            " Through comparative experiments with baseline, it can be seen that our model has achieved a great improvement in performance after calculating the attention between all nodes based on the entire graph. Compared with the model that calculates the attention between 1-hop neighbor nodes, our model is more able to mine the relationship between highorder neighbor nodes, In the association of microbial and drugs, an intuitive idea is if drug A interacts with drug B, and drug A interacts with microorganisms C, then we are likely to be inclined to speculate that drug B and microorganisms C have an interaction. When calculating 1-hop-based attention (such as GAT, HAN, HGT, and GCNMDA), this indirect correlation between drug B and microorganism C is ignored. However, in MDGNN, this indirect correlation will be taken into consideration, and the message will be passed between the nodes B and C through our proposed method, thus improving the prediction performance of the model. By comparing MDGNN and GCNMDA on three small datasets, we can further confirm our inference. On large dataset (MDAD, aBiofilm), our method is better than GCNMDA, and especially on aBiofilm dataset, our method can be nearly a percentage point higher than GCNMDA. This dataset is the most data in these three datasets. On the smallest dataset (DrugVirus), our method (AUC:0.8737, AUPR:0.8943) is inferior to GCNMDA (AUC:0.8986, AUPR:0.9038).\n",
            " According to the results in Table 4 , it can be seen that when the size of dataset grows, the number of indirect associations (like the relationship between B and C mentioned above) in the dataset will increase accordingly. This means that on large dataset, our method can learn more information about potential associations, and many of our final predictions of the association between microorganisms and drugs are inferred based on this potential association information.\n",
            " It can be seen that the calculation of the two kinds of attention brings stronger fitting ability to the model. Moreover, this powerful fitting ability allows our model to learn more structural information every time it performs The bold value means the best model. gradient descent, so as to converge more quickly during the training process. During the training process, we found that the optimization of these baseline training is extremely slow, and our model converges fast, so we train the model under different epochs settings to compare the effect of model training. When different numbers of epochs were set, the results obtained by each model are shown in Figure 4 .\n",
            " As can be seen from the experimental results, our model can converge to the optimal value within a very short training period. Under the same epoch value, our model has greatly improved compared with other models. MDGNN requires less than 500 epochs to make the AUC converge to above 0.96, while other comparison models fail to exceed 0.95 after 3,000 epochs.\n",
            " Through ablation experiments, we can analyze the role of each module. In the experiment, we analyze the function of each module by setting a model with different number of blocks. The specific ablation experimental results are shown in Table 5 .\n",
            " As can be seen from Table 4 , when both modules are used, the performance is the best. Specifically, when the node information integrated with node-attention is directly aggregated through multi-layer module, the model will produce negative optimization. The reason may be that after removing the feature-attention, the calculation in the multi-layer module is performed directly on the node vector that incorporates the node-attention, which will cause the decoupling of the attention calculated in the node-attention, which results in a decrease in the result.\n",
            " In addition, we conducted comparative experiments on the dimensions of different feature vectors and verified that the best experimental results were obtained when the dimension of feature vector was set to 100. The result is shown in Figure 5 .\n",
            " In case study, we use the deduplicated datasets, which contains the SARS-CoV-2-related data from the DrugVirus dataset. We save the trained model parameters and use them to make predictions on the entire dataset. The parameters of the model are trained on the randomly divided training set, selected, and saved according to the results on the test set.\n",
            " We load the trained model and then input the entire dataset into the model to obtain the feature vector of microorganisms and the feature vector of drugs. The corresponding microbial drug association score is obtained by inner product of the feature vector of microbe and the feature vector of drug.\n",
            " Taking SARS-CoV-2 as an example, we predicted the drugs that may treat the virus and took out the 10 drugs with the greatest possibility. The results are shown in Table 6 .\n",
            " Among the ten drugs that we predicted to treat SARS-CoV-2, four drugs were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 in our dataset, but our model predicted that these four drugs had a high potential to treat SARS-CoV-2. Through searching PubChem database, we found that two of the four drugs can indeed treat SARS-CoV-2. Darunavir is an antiretroviral protease inhibitor that is used in the therapy and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Deeks, 2018) . In our dataset, there is indeed an association between Darunavir and HIV, but there is no association between Darunavir and SARS-CoV-2 (Costanzo et al., 2020) . This real association does not exist in our dataset, and we can predict this association through the dataset. Similarly, Azithromycin is a drug that can treat SARS-CoV-2 (Rosenberg et al., 2020) . However, there is no association between Azithromycin and SARS-CoV-2 in our dataset where Azithromycin is only associated with Hepatitis C virus and HIV. In addition, our model successfully predicts the potential association between Azithromycin and SARS-CoV-2.\n",
            " With the rapid development of deep learning, there are many deep learning methods reported for drug development. For example, Beck et al. identified commercially available drugs to treat viral proteins using a pretrained deep learning-based drug target interaction model. Their results showed that drugs used to treat HIV might be effective against SARS-CoV-2 (Beck et al., 2020) . Joshi et al. (2020) used deep learning methods to predict the structural formula of chemical molecules and predict potential drugs for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 39 potential drugs for SARS-CoV-2 were predicted based on the CHEMBL dataset.\n",
            " The rapid spread of SARS-COV-2 and its variants have resulted a serious public health crisis. How to develop a specific drug quickly to tackle SARS-CoV-2 and its variants is an urgent problem. We propose a novel attentional mechanismbased graph neural network framework for learning network node representation and prove that our framework is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, which includes GCN, GAT, HAN, and HGT, etc. In addition, through a large number of drug and microbial data, we have screened potential drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, most of which are known to treat SARS-CoV-2.\n",

            "Body Text: Animals are an important part of our ecosystem and their existence either directly or indirectly affects the life of humans in various aspects and vice versa. Like humans, animals also suffer with several types of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Sometimes there are some common diseases also found in humans and animals as well as they can play a role of a disease carrier for each other's, for example, anthrax, brucellosis, giardiasis, and swine flu. Health risk of animal population may have an impact on food supply chains which is a threat to human health with long lasting effects and to economy as well. For the animal disease control which are communicable to man from livestock as well as wildlife animals, several organization including WHO conduct various programmes. These diseases known as zoonoses, comprised of existing infectious disease along with newly identified infectious disease to monitor the impact on human health.\n",
            " History related to animal diseases describes that human and animal diseases developed parallelly. Aristotle, the father of Biology and Hippocrates, the father of medicines, demonstrate animals and man's diseases symptomatology as well as therapy in their writing. Ancient literature are evident to animal and human diseases which include Egyptian, Roman, and Greeks monographs. In history, agriculture, domesticated animals were focused particularly. After the discovery of microorganisms by Pasteur, animal diseases became a matter of concern for veterinarians because of their direct effect on human health by consuming animal origin foods like meat and dairy products. After that basic research and zoonoses have been started for the detection and treatment of animal diseases (Charles et al. 2018 ).\n",
            " Any disease either in animals or in humans may be communicable and noncommunicable. The communicable term implies for interaction or communication between two living things which are known as host and parasite. The parasite exists in host cells and lives at the expense of their cellular machinery. Parasites are certain microorganisms such as virus, bacteria, protozoans, arthropods, and fungi, which are unable to survive on their own, so they depend on host organism for food, multiplication, or some other requirements. The disease-causing ability of a parasite is known as pathogenicity whereas ability to cause infection is known as virulence. The virulence property of a parasite is differed from one host to other, that it can be virulent for one but not to other hosts. Most of the parasite occurred in the atmosphere as an inactive form until they find appropriate conditions to establish themselves inside host cells. For example, Clostridium and Bacillus bacteria occurred as an inactive form known as spores for several years even in harsh environmental conditions. The host cell defense system i.e. immune system provides a variety of mechanical and chemical barriers against infection, and to establish disease in the host body, it is essential to cross all these barriers. In animals, communicable diseases can be spread through direct contact of animals, waste of sick animals, unhygienic housing of animals, and presence of microorganisms in feed and water. Certain types of lice, mites, ticks, and fleas present inside or outside of body, also play a role in spreading of diseases, for example, plague (Heymann 2008) . Some common types of communicable diseases and their host animals are represented in Fig. 19 .1.\n",
            " Non-communicable diseases, as the name suggested, not communicate from one animal to another and do not involve any virulent pathogens. Non-communicable diseases are caused by hereditary factors, poor feed, lack of nutrients, and environmental factors in surroundings. Sometimes it also caused by cuts, burns, certain toxic agents (insecticides, pesticides, fungicides, fluorine, and herbicides), or poisonous plants, and broken bones. Sometimes humans are responsible for some metabolic diseases in animals by injecting chemicals which causes the unsuitable alteration in body environment such as oxytocin is very commonly used in dairy animals to get more milk due to which contraction of uterus takes place and causes immense pain to the animal. Any disturbance in normal physiological conditions to maintain homeostasis and stability, leads to metabolic diseases. Non-communicable diseases are chronic and can be acute as well which causes a huge loss in milk, meat, and wool production. The working capacity and rate of reproduction of livestock can also be affected (Habib and Saha 2010) .\n",
            " Since it is impossible for a veterinarian to interrogate the animal, diagnosis of the animal disease includes a number of tests and examinations based on inspection of behaviour, palpation percussion, smells, eye examination, appearance, etc. Diseases like pullorum can be detected by agglutination test, tuberculin skin test for tuberculosis, faeces and eggs examination can be done in lab for early detection of diseases. Determination of chemicals, toxins in blood, or body fluids are performed for several years for a diagnosis of variety of animal diseases.\n",
            " To control certain chronic communicable and non-communicable diseases, early and fast detection is essential in a population of animals such as a herd of cattle. In recent times, every year newly emerging diseases threaten animal health are a matter of concern. For the early stage detection of diseases in the case of animals, there is currently a lack of authentication and cost-effective diagnostics. Considering biosensing technologies, as they have the potential to overcome these problems by developing novel diagnostic tools because of their high sensitivity to detect diseaserelated biomarkers with a low limit of detection. The available conventional sensors are used in livestock monitoring and also as a tool for the assessment and monitoring in health monitoring and disease detection. These sensors when integrated with wireless data transfer through a server or with cloud-based systems, enabling access to the analyzed data from any internet enabled device. Applications of nanobiosensor not only help in the reduction of the current costs for reagents, handling samples, time of analysis, and cost of transportation but also helps in adapting and promoting the handling of livestock. Biosensor is a simple, miniaturized analytical device which is utilized for rapid and efficient diagnosis of infectious diseases and has the ability for real time analysis (Sagadevan and Periasamy 2014) .\n",
            " animal medicine, these biomarkers help in the early detection of several cardiopulmonary diseases, confirmation of doubtful processes (normal or abnormal), and contribute to the establishment of prognosis to decide a specific treatment (Fry and Dunbar 2007; Carretón et al. 2013) . Also, they are used to detect the course of therapy or to predict safety or drug response. Biosensor consists of analytes, bio-recognition element (a biological element to detect analyte), and transducer surface (physiochemical detector component) to convert any biological signal to a measurable electric signal. Biomarkers play a key role in the fabrication of biosensors to detect several important diseases like cancer, Alzheimer, organ health monitoring after a transplant, diabetes, neurological disorders, etc. Biomarkers exploit in biosensors could be antigen-antibody, dopamine, uric acid, hydrogen peroxide, ascorbic acid, hormones, microRNA, enzymes, or whole cell (bacteria/viruses) (Zetterberg et al. 2019; Dahal 2019; Viitanen et al. 2014; Scherr et al. 2016; Pereira et al. 2016; Çolak et al. 2013; Alcaraz et al. 2016; Fei et al. 2016; Peng et al. 2017) . Some major diseases of animals along with their biomarkers are given in Table 19 .1.\n",
            " In most of the cases, human infectious diseases which include disease agents and pathogens are acquired from animal species. Several diseases such as SARS, Nipah virus, avian influenza, cat scratch disease, West Nile disease, mad cow disease etc. are associated with animals. Recent pandemic Covid 19 is also acquired from bat species. So, humans and animal's diseases are directly proportional to each other in about 60-75% cases (Wang and Anderson 2019).\n",
            " Aflatoxicosis: Aflatoxicosis is a widespread disease in animals and affects several animal species including cattle, chicks, ducklings, turkeys, horses, and pigs. Disease is caused by a mycotoxin which is produced by Aspergillus flavus, a most popular form of fungus. The feed items like millets, maize, soybeans, and peanuts, contaminated with fungi are source of disease. Aflatoxin is a highly toxic metabolite and mainly affects the liver through ingestion of contaminated feeds. The disease is characterized by drop in egg production particularly in poultry birds, loss of weight, and sometimes hepatocellular tumors appeared in severe conditions. Aflatoxicosis is associated with great economic loss as it reduced productivity by many folds, for African swine fever: African swine fever (ASF) is a severely contagious viral disease affecting domestic and wild pigs. It is caused by a DNA virus of Asfarviridae family which also responsible for infection in ticks of Ornithodoros genus. ASF associated with serious loss in production (pork, lard, leather, glue, fertilizer, and a variety of medicines produces through pigs) and economy. The virus is transmitted through a contaminated feed to animals and fomites such as shoes, knives, cloth, equipment, and vehicles. i.e. non-living things. The virus shows high resistant capacity for harsh environmental conditions. ASF has been reported in Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, and Caribbean. Symptoms of ASF include acute and chronic forms. Acute forms indicated by high fever, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, haemorrhages in the skin, and death within few days (6-20 days). Chronic forms are characterized by loss of weight, respiratory signs, chronic skin ulcers, intermittent fever, and arthritis. Chronic forms are less intense clinically and can persist for longer period with low mortality rate (Dixon et al. 2019) .\n",
            " Anthrax: A large spore forming Bacillus anthracis bacteria is responsible for anthrax disease. It is an extremely infectious and fatal disease that causes acute mortality in cattles. The bacterial toxin is highly potent which immediately shows ill effects and a high mortality rate. After exposure to this bacterial infection, symptoms usually appear within 3-7 days and animal death occurred usually within 2 days. Cattles usually get infections by grazing and inhaling the spores of bacteria which are colourless, odourless, and tasteless. The infected animal usually expresses sudden symptoms such as fever, difficulty in breathing, loss of appetite, Crepitation swelling over the shoulder hip, and back, which is followed by death. This is a highly dangerous disease and exhibit potential loss of economy (Doganay and Demiraslan 2015) .\n",
            " Avian influenza: Avian influenza or bird flu is caused by avian influenza A viruses which naturally occur among wild water birds. The virus generally infects birds, poultry, animals, and sometimes human beings may also get infected through contaminated poultry. Although humans rarely get infected with this virus, however virus can change itself and gain the ability to infect humans and spread among them.\n",
            " Influenza virus have the quality to change themselves time to time and certain strains spread easily in human populations. Symptoms arise within 2-8 days and include cough, cold, fever, headache, shortness of breath, and sore throat. The disease refers to high mortality rate in humans also (Li et al. 2019) . In recent times poultry business is one of the major areas of interest because of high demand in food industries. But avian influenza is one of the big challenges as it may cause major economic loss. Recent advancement makes possible to detect and continuously monitoring of disease through biosensors, wearable sensors, real time monitoring, and data management (Raj and Jayanthi 2018; Vidic et al. 2017) (Fig. 19.2) .\n",
            " Bluetongue: Bluetongue disease refers mainly the disease of ruminants including both domestic and wild animals, however Sheep are badly infected with disease. Cattle although frequently get infection than sheep but they lack symptoms most of the times. It is normally an insect-borne disease caused by bluetongue virus (BTV) and transmitted by different species of midges Culicoides. The infected animals Botulism: Botulism is a food borne disease caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria which produce highly potential neurotoxin commonly known as botulinum. It is a rapid onset fatal disease of cattle and avian species. Botulism typically represents by hindlimb weakness followed by collapse, paralysis, and death. Animal carcasses, poorly prepared silage and rotting organic material are the main sources of bacterial infection. Although the vaccine is available for this disease but still it is not completely eradicated. The disease outbreak can be seen in poultry and waterfowl (Mariano et al. 2019) .\n",
            " Brucellosis: Brucellosis is a bacterium causing the disease which mainly affects livestock including goats, sheep, cows, and some wild ruminants like deer, bison, and elk. It is caused by bacteria of genus Brucella. The disease mainly characterized by stillbirth or abortion in animals. The disease is spread through contaminated milk, birthing fluids, the infected placenta of animals, or direct contact with other animals or human beings. Canines can also infect with bacteria, but they are rarely spread infection to human beings. Complications associated with brucellosis consist of inflammation of the brain, infection of the heart's inner lining, meningitis, and lesions on the bones and joints (Shoukat et al. 2017) .\n",
            " Ehrlichiosis: Ticks are the carrier of this disease which commonly developed in canine bitten by infected ticks. It is caused by intracellular obligate organisms that belong to genus Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Neorickettsia of Anaplasmataceae family. The parasite is primarily infecting the immune cells of canines and humans. Infected animals are suffered from fever, Reticuloendothelial hyperplasia, lymphadenopathy, Splenomegaly, loss of stamina, stiffness, and edema of limbs (Mylonakis et al. 2019) .\n",
            " Hendra virus Disease: It is mainly a disease of fruit bats which can be infectious to horses also. Hendra virus infection has infrequently been infectious to humans who came into contact with an infected horse. Infected horses may possess a range of symptoms like fever, respiratory, and neurological disorders and show rapid onset illness. The host develops symptoms within 5-21 days after infection with Hendra virus. At initial stage, some common symptoms appear as fever, cough, headache, and tiredness whereas later, meningitis and coma have been seen in severe infection conditions. Hendra virus disease can be fatal sometimes (Field et al. 2011) .\n",
            " Hydatid disease: Hydatidosis, echinococcosis, or hydatid disease, caused by cyst consist of Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm (Dog Tapeworm) larval stage, is an extremely serious condition and sometimes may be fatal. The disease is mainly infecting dogs and other canines. Infected animals shed eggs in their faeces which further infect other host by swallowing these eggs or by direct contact with infected dogs. The cyst can be remained inside the liver and lungs for months to several years. The disease show signs of weight loss, weakness, and loss of appetite. The rupture of cyst may cause serious allergic reactions even death of animals. Although Hydatid infection is potentially severe but may be treatable. The disease occurs worldwide, commonly in grazing areas (Qingling et al. 2014) .\n",
            " Listeriosis: Animals, fishes, crustacean, birds, and even humans can be infected with Listeriosis; which is a serious infection and become fatal sometimes. Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of this food borne disease. It has the potential to transmit from one cell to another and can cross intestinal, placental, and blood brain barriers. The disease is characterized by encephalitis, meningitis, meningoencephalitis, stillbirth, abortion septicaemia, perinatal infections. Listeriosis is a sporadic disease which spread through soil, water, milk, meat, seafood, and vegetables. There is no vaccine available for this disease so it can be prevented only through hygienic practices (Oevermann et al. 2010) .\n",
            " Newcastle disease: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a causative agent of Newcastle disease of domestic poultry and other species of birds. It is primarily represented by acute respiratory diseases, but diarrhoea, depression, or nervous manifestations can also be seen predominantly as a clinical form. Infected animals shed infection through respiratory discharge, eggs, and faeces. In poultry disease, may spread by ingesting water or food contaminated with virus. Movement of infected poultry birds, contaminated equipment, or litter plays an important role for spreading viruses. The signs of disease in an infected organism are appeared in 2-12 days of exposure of virus (Brown and Bevins 2017) .\n",
            " Nipah virus disease: Nipah virus or NiV belongs to genus henipavirus and paramyxovirus family causes a highly fatal disease Nipah. Natural host of nipah virus is fruit bat and currently, it affects pigs and humans very severely with high mortality rate. The virus is spread through bat urine, faeces, birthing fluids, and saliva. It is assumed that bat excreta initiate infection in pigs. The virus mainly affects the nervous system and respiratory system. The virus is highly contagious to pigs and associated with barking pig syndrome (BPS) and encephalitic syndrome (PRES). Nipah virus may also infect dogs naturally and causes a distemper-like syndrome which is a highly fatal condition (Ang et al. 2018 ).\n",
            " Ruminal tympany: It is also known as bloat. The disease mainly found in ruminant animals and characterized by high amount of gas in rumen. It can be divided into two phase, primary frothy bloat, and secondary free gas bloat. In a natural process, the rumen is dedicated for fermentation of eaten food by gut microbes and the fermentation process produces excessive amount of gas which expelled out from rumen by burping continuously but sometimes gas becomes trapped inside the rumen. This condition is remarked as bloat or ruminal tympany. In primary bloat, produced gas trapped within fermenting material which causes a raised amount of foam and unable to remove by burping. The disease is characterized by distension of abdomen on left side, distress, and difficulty in breathing. This disease can be fatal if gas accumulation process continues which also distended right side of abdomen. After visualization of such symptoms, the cattle death may occur within 3-4 h. In the secondary bloat, oesophagus becomes blocked so accumulated gas cannot be pass through it (Priyanka and Dey 2018) .\n",
            " In the case of animals, this is very difficult to find out the nutritional deficiencies. Most of the animals suffer from malnutrition. There is a lack of signs related to most of the nutritional deficiencies because signs are common and not specific such as loss of appetite, reduction in growth, and thriftiness. Multiple types of nutritional deficiencies may be caused in many animals due to starvation. Deficiency of some essential amino acids or suboptimal feed intake may result into protein deficiencies which causes weight loss and fatter carcasses in pigs. In lactating animals for example cows, protein deficiency directly affects milk production. Some fatty acids like linoleic acid are found very essential in the diet and utilized in production of another essential form i.e. longer chain fatty acids. The lack of linoleic acid in the diet leads to scaly dermatitis, necrosis in skin, unthrifty appearance, and hair loss in growing pigs. Deficiency of minerals like calcium and phosphorous may outcome as a disease known as rickets in pigs, dogs, and others. The disease is characterized by deformity, lameness, and bending of bones specifically long bones. Consequences of severe conditions are fracture and paralysis at posterior parts, generally in old ones. Salt deficiency also affects the growth of animals.\n",
            " Iodine deficiency may result into hairless and week pig's new-born. New-born pigs may show enlarged thyroids and histological abnormalities. Enlarged thyroid can also be seen in many animals and known as Goitre. Iodized salt may get rid of this disease.\n",
            " Iron and copper deficiencies efficiently develop anaemia in animals which is caused by a reduction in haemoglobin synthesis. Anaemia may be recognized by low RBC and haemoglobin count, enlarged heart, edema, and thumps. Deficiency of zinc, selenium, and vitamin E also have an adverse effect on growing or younger ones.\n",
            " Vitamins are very essential for the development and metabolic processes in humans as well as in animals. In livestock and pets, if they provided with some supplemented commercially available diets then chances are very low to face the vitamin deficiency challenges because these are fortified with vitamins. Vitamin A deficiency affects eyes, epithelial tissues of important organ systems like the nervous, urinary, digestive, respiratory, and reproductive. Vitamin K deficiency is related with lengthened blood clotting and sometimes animals may die due to haemorrhage. Riboflavin deficiency in pigs may result into impaired reproduction. Vitamin B deficiency also affects severely to neonatal pigs in terms of voice failure, hyperirritability, and incoordination like symptoms. Biotin deficiency also characterized by excessive hair loss, dermatitis, inflammation of mouth, and mucous membrane (Innis 2000; Vieyra-Reyes et al. 2017; Shukla et al. 2016 ).\n",
            " Nano biosensing devices exploit a biorecognition element which can be DNA/RNA, antigen/antibodies, enzymes, aptamers, and other polymers, etc. There are several studies done to develop a nano-biosensing device by using various biomarkers. Here, some types of biosensors description are given that are developed to detect several serious diseases (Table 19 .2).\n",
            " DNA based sensors are developed for the detection of several biomarkers depend upon the specific nucleic acid sequences. Various forms of nanomaterial are used for signal amplification which generated through the hybridization of two complementary DNA. Anthrax disease can be detected through a label free nanopore real time sensing device, in which a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was used as a molecular probe for anthrax lethal factor (Wang et al. 2014) . A unique nanostructure based geno-sensor was fabricated to detect Brucella-specific probe. A gold nanoribbon surrounded by gold nano blooms were further deposited on polycrystalline gold surface by sonoelectrodeposition method. In this approach, methylene blue was used as redox marker to detect complementary sequence, sequences with one-, two-, and three bases mismatches (Rahi et al. 2015) . Another DNA biosensor also studied for Brucella species detection in animals which consists of a specific oligonucleotide probe taken from S711 gene region and gold nanoparticle. This probe hybridized with complementary DNA biomarker present in a clinical sample. The device was capable to detect unamplified Brucella genomic DNA up to 7 pg µL −1 . The DNA biosensor exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity to amplified clinical samples (Sattarahmady et al. 2016) . In a study, gold nanorods are functionalized with specific ssDNA probe of 'cadF gene' to detect campylobacter species. In this study about 283 stool samples were analysed and showed 44 positive cases, that indicated sensitivity of device, rapid in comparison to PCR, culture, and real time PCR (Shams et al. 2019) .\n",
            " Another study demonstrates the utilization of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in combination with PCR assay for successful detection of Ehrlichia canis. The QCM based DNA nano-biosensor device was reusable, simple and do not need any critical equipment. The basic principle of this device was DNA-DNA hybridization without any cross hybridization. The limit of detection of QCM was calculated as low as 4.1×10 9 molecules/µl of 289 bp E. canis PCR product that represented to 22 copy numbers/µl of E. canis (Bunroddith et al. 2018 ). Newcastle disease virus RNA detection was carried out by Tian and co-workers by combination of two highly efficient techniques that are loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and opto magnetic nanoparticle-based readout system. The detection limit was 10 aM of target sequence in just 30 min (Tian et al. 2016).\n",
            " Aptasensors are fabricated by employing aptamers. Aptamers are naturally occurring or synthesized short random oligonucleotides or peptides sequences. Generally, they are developed through SELEX method. In the animal disease detection aptasensors were also utilized for rapid and accurate detection of disease biomarkers. An electrochemical graphene field-effect transistor based aptasensor has been developed for detection of anthrax toxin (Kim et al. 2013) . The avian influenza detection can be possible through aptamer-based nano-biosensor devices. Several aptasensors work has been carried out for detection of avian influenza virus. For example, an impedance aptasensor was developed for the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1). To enhance impedance signal, a gold nanoparticle-based amplifier was designed and functionalized with H5N1-aptamer and thiocyanuric acid. The device exhibited a robust, specific, and rapid detection method for the H5N1 virus with the detection limit of 0.25 haemagglutination unit (HAU) (Karash et al. 2016) . Aptasensors were also used for detection of Anthrax disease in animals. Recently, a nano-biosensor device which was based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes and fluorescence aptasensors was fabricated. In this study, researchers detected 'recombinant protective antigen domain 4 (rPAD4)' of Bacillus anthracis which plays an important role in the development of disease. The aptamers were labelled with gel green fluorescent dye and immobilized on carbon nanotubes to give amplified signals after hybridization of complementary sequences. The device had the potential to be used for diagnostic tests for anthrax in a fast, accurate, sensitive, and cost-effective manners (Karimi and Dabbagh 2019) . Another frequently occurred disease in animals is bovine viral diarrhoea that could be also detected by aptasensors. In 2013 a biosensor based on two different aptamers was fabricated for successful screening of binding to bovine viral diarrhoea virus type 1 (BVDV type 1) in a clinical sample. The aptamer had a high affinity and specificity to this virus biomarker. In this study, the work was based upon basic principle of aptamer-aptamer sandwich type sensing platform in which one aptamer immobilized with gold nanoparticle and other hybridized with viral DNA BVDV type 1. The device was capable to detect 800 copies/ml (Park et al. 2014 ).\n",
            " Immunosensors are basically worked on the principle of antigen and antibody reaction. Several types of biosensors have been developed to detect animal diseases in minimum time and cost-effective way. Immunosensors utilized different type of transducer surface such as electrochemical, and optical (colorimetric, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), fluorescent, chemiluminescence), etc. Bluetongue virus associated biomarker VP7outer-core protein was detected by a nanobiosensor fabricated by exploitation of gold nanoparticle probe-based assay and bio-barcode assay technique. In this device anti-VP7 monoclonal antibodies and ssDNA are immobilized on magnetic microparticle probes. The developed biosensor exhibited the detection limit of 10 −2 fg mL −1 (Yin et al. 2012) . Electrochemical immunosensor consists of single gold nanowire that has been developed in 2015 for the detection of bovine viral diarrhoea virus. In this device researchers immobilized captured biomarker of virus on gold nanowire covalently by electrodeposition method. Immunosensing device was applied for detection of serum antibodies in the serum of infected animals. Team specified their device as a very sensitive with very low detection limit so could be applied for on-farm diagnosis for animal health monitoring (Montrose et al. 2015) . BVDV monitoring could make possible through another microfluidic immunosensor by Heinze and co-workers in 2009 . In this study they demonstrated a microfluidic based platform which consist of anti-BVDV monoclonal antibodies immobilized on carboxylated polystyrene microparticles. The performance of device had been compared with real time PCR where they found the very low detection limit in microfluidic device (Heinze et al. 2009 ). Enzootic bovine leucosis is a blood borne disease which affect mainly cattle and caused by BLV or bovine leukosis virus. The virus resides in white blood cells and asymptomatic most of the time. SPR based immunosensor was fabricated recently in 2019 for detection of BLV in blood serum of sick animals (Klestova et al. 2019 ). An optical immunosensor for the detection of BLV has been developed by exploiting the UV and visible photoluminescence property of zinc oxide nanoparticles. The device was suitable for field use. The device showed high sensitivity and a wide range of leucosis antibody detection i.e. 0.001 mg mL −1 to 1 mg ml −1 (Ruban et al. 2017) . Another surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based immunosensor has been also developed for the detection of this disease in 2013. In this study magnetic gold nanoparticles (MNP-Au) functionalized with fragmented antibodies specific for gp51 biomarker were used. They were resulted out the limit of detection as 0.95 µg mL −1 and limit of quantification as 3.14 µg mL −1 for gp51 (Baniukevic et al. 2013) . A method for the diagnosis of foot and mouth disease was also developed with the help of an electrochemical immunosensor. A non-structural protein i.e. 3ABC of associated disease was detected through specific antibodies by utilization of a screen-printed electrode (Longinotti et al. 2010) . Hydatid disease is associated with Echinococcus granulosis. Several studies have been carried out for the development of immunosensor to detect the associated biomarker. In a study, researcher developed silicon microcavities based nanosensor to perform antigen antibody interaction on it. An associated protein named protein kinase P38 was targeted for detection of hydatid diseases . Quantum dots based immuno biosensor also demonstrated in a 2017 study. In this device they immobilized Egp38 antigen on silicon pores which further functionalized with anti-p38 labelled CdSe/ZnS QDs. This was a fluorescence-based detection. They achieved detection limit 300 fg mL −1 for Egp38 antigen . Very recently, an immunosensor has been developed for this disease using square wave voltammetry technique. Cysteamine/phenylene isothiocyanate linkers have been coated on gold electrodes followed by immobilization of either purified 'rabbit polyclonal antibody' or 'recombinant antigen B' (AgB) to detect hydatid antigen. Detection limits for echinococcus antigen and antibody were 0.4 pg mL −1 and 0.3 pg mL −1 , respectively. The device is low of cost, sensitive and can be used as a point of care device (Eissa et al. 2020) . Newcastle disease is also a fatal disease which affect several animals worldwide. A very simple electrochemical immunosensor was developed recently for detection of NDV. In this device chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) was utilized as a biorecognition element and were specific for NDV antigen. The sensor had exhibited a sensitivity range of 10 6 to 10 2 EID 50 mL −1 (Thinh et al. 2018) . Listeriosis is also a very harmful disease and can be detected through immunosensors. A 2013 work reported a Screen-printed carbon electrode modified with gold nanoparticle exhibited great sensitivity for detection of Listeria species. Listeria monocytogenes presence was monitored through conjugating secondary enzyme-labelled antibodies (Davis et al. 2013 ). The biosensor found to be effective in detection of other enteric bacterial species such as E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium. Another 2017 study revealed an immunosensor fabricated with a pair of monoclonal antibodies. These pair of mAbs used to recognize P60 protein associated with Listeria species (Wang et al. 2017 ).\n",
            " CRISPR-Cas assay with a fluorescence-based point-of-care (POC) system has been developed for the detection of African swine fever virus detection. The LOD was found as 1 pM in 2 h (He et al. 2020) . Recently, a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) based sensor was developed for detection of Campylobacter jejuni in a milk sample. This microbial agent is responsible for several gastrointestinal related diseases in humans. A MOS sensor has the ability to differentiate between contaminated and control samples (Núñez-Carmona et al. 2020) . Another advancement in nanobiosensors can be represented by wearable biosensors. For continuous real time monitoring of herd of animals and livestock; wearable biosensors show a great significance in the health management of animals. They provide physiological information through non-invasive, dynamic measurement of biomarkers in biofluids like saliva, sweat, tears, and interstitial fluids (Neethirajan 2017) .\n",
            " Nano-biosensing devices are known for their high sensitivity, simplicity, and selectivity to detect animals or human diseases. They are able to provide rapid results with low cost in comparison to conventional methods (Malik et al. 2013) . Animals are extremely susceptible to infection because of unhygienic living environment therefore suffer with number of communicable diseases and their direct contact with human beings make the situation more problematic. Animal communicable diseases cause significant economic loss in various ways like loss in food production system, and increased veterinary costs (Kivaria 2006; Ott et al. 1999; Dufour 1999; Neethirajan 2019) . We consider that nano-biosensors have capability to advance conventional technologies for detection of disease-causing microorganisms and can improve the surveillance system to prevent any disease outbreak. Wearable devices can play an important role in future to manage animal diseases. Real time field monitoring, data networking, sampling methods, and mobile analysis will provide remarkable support through highly sensitive and selective nano-biosensors. The data through device will help in disease control and prevention of outbreak in poultry, livestock as well as wild animals.\n",
            " Prevention of communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases is very essential for the health management of animals. Human beings are also affected with animal disease directly or indirectly and have various common diseases. The first step required for prevention of any disease is accurate diagnosis. It is important to develop some reliable, cost effective, and less time-consuming methods. Fast diagnosis is must in some disease for example anthrax which causes death within 2 days. Sometimes some diseases are remained asymptomatic like bovine leucosis, so they also need accurate detection in very low concentration. Nanotechnology exhibit several new opportunities to fabricate new devices for the successful determination of diseases. With the help of biomarkers, these nano-biosensors have given promising results in the diagnosis of animal diseases. Communicable and non-communicable diseases affecting animals at a different level can now detect at an early stage, monitored, and controlled with the help of nano-biosensor.\n",

            "Title: R E V I E W Innate defences against viraemia\n",
            "Body Text: Innate nonspeci®c resistance mechanisms are important barriers to pathogens particularly in maintaining an initial critical balance at the onset of infections. They represent a conglomeration of mechanical barriers, cellular reactions and molecules with antimicrobial activity. Here we will consider the antiviral molecules which have been reported to occur in human serum, because viraemia is an important mode of viral spread to the target organs in the body. Normal human serum has been reported to possess inhibitory activities against particular viruses and individual groups of viruses. These antiviral activities reside in a variety of uncharacterised or partly characterised substances [1, 2] . Recently certain molecules in normal human serum have been described that are active against a broad spectrum of viruses [3, 4] . These molecules have been characterised for their antiviral activity, molecular structure and mechanism of antiviral action. In this review, we emphasise the properties of broadly active antiviral molecules in human serum and explore the possibility that they can be important as natural defence mechanisms.\n",
            " As noted above, the innate antiviral activities reside in a variety of uncharacterised or partly characterised substances, most of which are distinguishable from antibody, interferon and complement. Many of the antiviral substances have generally been reported to act against single viruses, such as coronavirus, Newcastle disease virus, variola virus, Sendai virus and vesicular stomatitis virus [5±9] . Some are active against individual virus families, including myxoviruses, togaviruses and retroviruses [10±12] . The mechanisms of action of these viral inhibitors, when known, vary. Some of them act by irreversible neutralisation of infectivity, as in the case with coronavirus and Sendai virus inhibitors [5, 8] . The myxo-and togavirus inhibitors appear to prevent haemagglutination but not infectivity [10, 11] . The inhibitor of vesicular stomatitis virus acts by penetration of the viral envelope and inactivation of viral RNA [9] . The retrovirus inhibitor works via complement mediated lysis of the virally infected cells [12] . Heparin, which may be used medically to prevent clotting, has narrow antiviral activity, but deserves to be mentioned because of its potent activity against HIV-1 [13±15].\n",
            " Only four broad-spectrum viral inhibitors have been reported in human sera. IFN and TNF occur in response to infections, in¯ammation and cancer [16±19]. The others are constitutive, i.e. UTIb and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and their antiviral activities are presented in Table 1 [3, 4, 20] . The antiviral activity was determined by a plaque reduction assay as described previously [21] . The assay was done in duplicate, using the continuous presence of 2-fold serial dilutions of the test substance in 96-well microtitre plates with con-¯u ent cell monolayer and challenged with 40 PFU of virus (MOI=0.03). One unit (U) of antiviral activity was de®ned as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the inhibitor showing 50% reduction of plaques compared with the virus control. A reference virus inhibitor standard was used in each assay as a positive control. The viruses used in these studies were originally from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, except Coxsackie virus B3, which was obtained from Dr Charles J. Gaunt, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX. Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cell, American Type Culture Collection, CCL81) were used for assaying the viruses except for vaccinia. For this virus CERs (chicken embryo reticulocytes) received from the laboratory of Dr Robert Shope, Yale University, CT at that time, were used [3, 4] . A broad antiviral activity may be an important feature of an antiviral defence. Table 1 shows that UTIb and HDL inhibited all of the viruses tested, which included DNA and enveloped and nonenveloped RNA viruses. However, UTIb was not active against HIV (unpublished ®ndings). The inhibitory activity of UTIb was usually greater than HDL against the same virus, so UTIb appears to account for most of the antiviral activity of human serum. The two preparations of HDL were comparable except that the preparation from Dr G. M. Ananthramiah, Department of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and The Arthrosclerosis Research Unit, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294-0012, USA, was inactive against poliovirus. This difference could be due to the extent of processing used in different methods of puri®cation.\n",
            " As determined enzymatically UTIb is a glycoprotein. It has a M r of approximately 60t10r10 3 based on HPLC size exclusion chromatography. Its antiviral activity is stable at pH 2±10 and at 80uC for up to 10 min. Mild oxidation by sodium periodate and glycolysis by a mixture of glycosidases destroys its antiviral activity. Proteinase digestion degrades the inhibitor into small components of M r <1000, which retain broad antiviral activity. This activity of the small components has increased heat stability (120uC for 15 min) but is still inactivated by glycosidases. Thus the antiviral activity appears to reside mainly in a separable oligosaccharide moiety of the glycoprotein, UTIb [3] .\n",
            " Human serum HDL is a lipoprotein of M r 300 000 and occurs in the serum in the range of 30 to 80 mg/dL. Its antiviral property seems to reside in its protein component apolipoprotein A-1. Apolipoprotein A-1 has been reported to inhibit HIV and HSV-1 [22, 23] . As shown in Table 1 HDL is broadly active against DNA and enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses.\n",
            " Brie¯y, the mode of inhibition during virus growth was determined by investigating whether the inhibition was the result of (1) direct reversible neutralisation of virions, (2) inhibition of virus attachment to cells, (3) inhibition of viral penetration of cells or (4) effects later in the virus multiplication cycle. The reversibility of inhibition of viral infectivity was determined by mixing the inhibitor preparation with the virus suspension and then incubating the mixture at 37uC for 2 h. After incubation, the mixture was diluted beyond the inhibitory level to determine the residual titre of infectious virus that was not irreversibly neutralised by the inhibitor. The results indicated that UTIb and HDL did not irreversibly inactivate either enveloped or non-enveloped viruses.\n",
            " The possibility of inhibition of virus attachment to target cells was examined by comparing the inhibitory titres at 4uC for 2 h (virus attachment only) with 37uC for 2 h (virus attachment and penetration). A virus challenge dose of 40 PFU was used to infect the con¯uent monolayer cells in a 96-well microtitre plate at the two temperatures. The cultures were then washed three times with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and overlaid with 0.5% methylcellulose in Hepes buffer (MC) [24] . Plaques were stained with crystal violet and read on day 2. The rationale for this experiment is that at 4uC the cell membrane is physiologically inert, and hence virus replication should not proceed beyond initial attachment to the target cell. Equal antiviral activity (titres) at 4uC and 37uC imply that the antiviral substance is active at 4uC, and, therefore, acts at the stage of virus attachment to target cells. Inhibitors acting at post-attachment stages result in signi®cantly higher titres at 37uC. As shown in Table 2 the titres of UTIb at 4uC and 37uC for all viruses used except HSV-1 were statistically indistinguishable. In the case of HSV-1, an inhibitory titre of 48 U/mL occurred at 37uC compared with 9 U/mL at 4uC, indicating that some of the inhibition of HSV-1 replication is at a step subsequent to adsorption.\n",
            " In comparison, in the case of HDL, Sindbis or mengo virus attachment was not inhibited at 4uC, indicating that HDL inhibited at a post-attachment step in virus replication. To study the possibility that the HDL prevents penetration of virus into cells, a modi®ed method previously described was followed [23] . To allow only virus attachment, the cells were precooled to 4uC for 1 h in a 96-well microtitre plate, infected with 40 PFU (MOI=0.03) of Sindbis or mengo virus, and after 1 h in the cold to allow virus to attach to cells, washed twice with cold HBSS to remove unabsorbed virus. The cells were warmed to 37uC to initiate virus penetration for 1 h in the presence of serial two-fold dilutions of inhibitor to allow any inhibitory effect to occur during the time of penetration. The cultures were then washed once with HBSS and refed Eagles minimum essential medium (EMEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). To each well 50 mL containing 100 U/mL of antibodies speci®c to the virus was added to neutralise any virus held extracellularly by the HDL. The cells were then incubated at 37uC for 0.5 h before washing and refeeding. Antibody controls showed the effectiveness of antibody neutralisation at 0.5 h. The cells were washed twice with HBSS, and then over layered with 0.5% MC and incubated until the plaques developed. The plaques were counted and the percent inhibition of plaques relative to control was calculated as an indicator of inhibition of virus events at the stage of virus penetration. The results in Table 3 show that cells infected in the presence of HDL consistently retained virus on their surface as evidenced by the effectiveness of neutralisation by antibody added 1 h after the start of incubation with HDL. Thus, in the presence of HDL, virus attachment occurred, but penetration did not occur.\n",
            " The time of inhibition of virus replication during its growth cycle was determined as described previously [24] . The inhibitor preparation was added at various times during a one-step growth cycle of the virus and virus yield was determined during the single cycle by harvesting virus at 8 h. Synchronised initiation of virus replication (designated 0 h) was obtained by infecting monolayers with virus in 96-well culture plates at 4uC for 2 h to allow attachment of virus. The cells were then washed three times with cold EMEM to remove unabsorbed virus and inhibitor and then refed with warm (37uC) inhibitor or EMEM containing 2% FBS. After incubation for completion of a single cycle of virus replication at 8 h the cultures were stored at x70uC. For virus yield, quadruplicate wells were pooled for virus plaque assay. The virus yield was calculated from the PFU endpoints. The results are shown in Figure 1 and indicate that inhibition of Sindbis virus occurred principally when HDL was added between 0 and 1 h during the growth cycle. This early inhibition indicates that the antiviral action of HDL occurred early in the virus growth cycle and is consistent with an inhibition of viral penetration as determined in the preceding section.\n",
            " The possible induction by the serum inhibitors of a durable antiviral state in cells (e.g. similar to IFN) by UTIb and HDL was determined. Serial dilutions of the inhibitors and cell monolayers were incubated overnight. The cells were washed \n",
            " The main broad-spectrum viral inhibitors in serum are UTIb and, to a lesser degree, HDL. Preincubation of virus with UTIb and HDL did not reduce infectivity, indicating that they do not bind irreversibly to virions or irreversibly neutralise their infectivity. Similarly preincubation of cells with HDL and UTIb, unlike IFN, did not induce an antiviral state in the cells. Inhibition experiments at 4uC and 37uC revealed that UTIb inhibits virus by preventing virus attachment. This same type of experiment showed that HDL, on the other hand, acts against most viruses at a post-attachment stage. Further investigations of mechanism of viral inhibition by HDL indicated that HDL inhibits the multiplication cycle at an early stage between 0 and 1 h of initiation, most likely by preventing penetration of cell surface by virus.\n",
            " In vivo studies of the protective role of these broad-spectrum serum inhibitors have not been done. There is, however, one report of in vivo protective effect of a broadly active, nonspeci®c virus inhibitor found in vertebrate nervous systems. Protection of inhibitor-treated mice was demonstrated against both an alphavirus and a picornavirus (Table 4 ). Based on this protection and other correlations, the authors suggested a natural defensive role for this broadly antiviral inhibitor that is present widely and in high concentration in tissues and extracellular¯uid of human nervous system [25] . Similar in vivo protection studies should be done with the serum inhibitors. A possible defensive role of the narrowly active serum inhibitors in natural resistance has been reviewed by Kriznova and Rathova [10] . The mechanisms of action of these inhibitors are competitive inhibition of virus attachment to cells and neutralisation of viral infectivity by a mechanism unlike classical antibody because complement is not needed for their activity. The various approaches undertaken to elucidate the possible role of these serum inhibitors in the natural resistance of the organism was grouped into three categories. In the ®rst category an effort was made to ®nd a correlation between the susceptibility of experimental animals to a particular virus, and the natural inhibitory activity of their sera [1,26±28] . The correlations showed that the experimental animals used were resistant to several strains of in¯uenza virus when innate serum inhibitors against these strains were present in their sera [27] .\n",
            " In the second category, efforts were made to measure the effect of suppression or deletion of serum inhibitors on the susceptibility of the experimental animals to virus infection. In several experiments it was shown that mice and hamsters fed ethionine had appreciably reduced virus inhibitory activity in serum against in¯uenza A 1 and Newcastle disease viruses than did untreated . These observations point to a relationship in vivo between the level of serum inhibitors and in¯uenza virus multiplication and thus support the notion that the narrowly active, nonspeci®c viral inhibitors can be a factor in innate resistance to speci®c viruses. The third category assessed the direct effect of administering the inhibitors at different times during viral infection. Experimental animals were administered an inhibitor preparation at different intervals either before or immediately after virus inoculation. Using gamma serum inhibitor it was shown that the multiplication of the inhibitor-sensitive strain of in¯uenza A 2 virus in mice lungs was inhibited. This effect was seen only when the inhibitor was administered before the virus had time to penetrate into susceptible cells. The inhibitor and the virus were administered intranasally [32±36]. Gamma inhibitor given intranasally 4±6 h post-infection or later was not protective while high doses of inhibitor given ip even at longer intervals after infection showed an appreciable protective effect [34] . While there is no satisfactory explanation for this ®nding, it appears that, overall, gamma inhibitor can function as a defence mechanism under some conditions.\n",
            " We have compared the properties and mechanisms of action of constitutive (UTIb and HDL) and inducible (IFN and TNF) inhibitors because of their importance as broadly active defences against viraemia. Table 5 compares the properties of these inhibitors and shows that constitutive virus inhibitors, UTIb and HDL, are clearly distinct from the inducible IFN and TNF defences.\n",
            " Innate antiviral substances present in human plasma have not been carefully explored as natural defences against viraemia and infection. This review indicates that plasma contains several naturally occurring nonspeci®c antiviral substances, some of which are broadly active against a wide range of DNA and enveloped and nonenveloped RNA viruses. The mechanism of action of the broadly active UTIb occurs during virus attachment and that of HDL during virus penetration. A limited study of the in vivo protective role of some of the antiviral substances indicates their importance against infection, particularly in early stages of infection before reactive host defences, like IFN and speci®c immunity, are induced. Further studies are needed in this area of virology.\n",

            "Body Text: In order to hijack the host cellular machinery for their own replication, viruses are endowed with proteins that mediate the rearrangement of host cell membranes [1, 2] . To determine the viral cycle in the host and to develop effective pharmacological treatments, it is therefore important to understand how viral proteins interact with the lipid membranes and proteins of the host cells.\n",
            " In SARS-CoV-2, it has been shown that the envelope protein (E) can promote changes in the properties of lipid membranes of the secretory organelles of the host cells, which help in packaging and releasing the new viral particles [3, 4] . E has thus a dual role, since it acts both as a structural protein, being an essential part of the viral capsid, and as a modulator of the cell membrane properties of the host cell during the replication of the virus. E is a transmembrane protein with a sequence of 76 amino acids, which has 97% sequence similarity with human SARS-CoV (Figure 1 ) and bat SARS-like CoV [4] [5] [6] . It consists of a hydrophilic N-terminal peptide (E-NTD), a central hydrophobic transmembrane domain (E-TMD) [7] , and a weakly hydrophobic C-terminal domain (E-CTD) [8] (Figure 1 ). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi of the host cells, the E-NTD is luminally-oriented, the E-TMD has an ion channel activity mediated by the formation of pentameric oligomers [7] , and the E-CTD is cytoplasmicoriented [8] . Through this arrangement, the E-CTD can thus modify the properties of the ER and Golgi membranes, and interact with many host proteins, including Bcl-xL, PALS1, syntenin, sodium/potassium (Na + /K + ) ATPase α-1 subunit, and stomatin [9] . In this way, the E-CTD is crucial for cellular trafficking, in particular by targeting proteins towards Golgi interactions [9] .\n",
            " An important question concerns the structural basis for the dual role of E, and for its ability to interact with a variety of different partners. Towards providing an answer to this question, it has been shown that the E-CTD of SARS-CoV exists in a dynamic exchange between different conformations [10] . E-CTD residues 46-75 were identified as a disorder-based protein binding region, also known as MoRF [5] , suggesting that the E-CTD may exhibit features characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which lack a specific stable three-dimensional structure [11] . The disordered nature of IDPs enables them to adopt different conformations upon binding with different partners [12, 13] . In particular, the E-CTD has a predicted β-coil-β motif with a conserved proline residue at its center [10] . Further, the region of residues 46-60 of SARS-CoV E, as a synthetic peptide in isolation, was reported to adopt a β structure under certain conditions [10] . A conserved motif, CxxC (Figure 1A) , mediates membrane-directed conformational changes [14] . The E-CTD also contains several glycosylation sites, including N45, N48, N4, and N68, which are essential for host membrane-associated oligomerization of E [15] . The last four residues of the E-CTD of SARS-CoV E contain a protein-binding motif known as (PDZ)-binding motif (PBM) (Figure 1A) , which interacts with host proteins and works to suppress host responses to viral infections [16] . Mutation of the protein binding motif in E-CTD resulted in decreased virulence of SARS-CoV [16, 17] . In addition, the short peptide TK9 (TVYVYSRVK) in the SARS-CoV E-CTD, which is important for the oligomerisation of E resulting in the formation of the ion channel complex, has been shown to be amyloidogenic [18] .\n",
            " In this study, in order to provide a more systematic understanding of the conformational properties of the E-CTD, we report a series of measurements under different biological environment mimetics, including in membrane-mimicking environments, under -helical inducing conditions, and in the presence natural osmolytes ( Figure 1B) . Finally, we investigated the aggregation process of E-CTD upon incubation under physiological conditions.\n",
            " To obtain insight into the conformational properties of the E-CTD, we performed a sequencebased secondary structure analysis using the s2D, JPred4, PEP2D, and PsiPred servers ( Figure   2 ). s2D predicted a tendency to form both ordered and disordered regions in the E-CTD ( Figure   2A ). These results were consistent with those obtained with: (1) JPred4, which predicted residues 6-11 and 16-20 as β-sheet (31%) and remaining random coil (69%) for SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 2B) , (2) PEP2D, which predicted two regions (residues 7-11 and 20-24) as α-helix, three regions (residues 1-3, 12-16, 27-35) as random coil, and one region (residues [17] [18] [19] as random coil, one region (residues 55-61) as β-sheet/strand, and one short region (residues 62-63) as α-helix ( Figure 2D ). Taken together, these predictors indicate that the E-CTD has high disordered propensity (55-74%).\n",
            " Next, using far UV CD spectroscopy, we found that the E-CTD exhibits a minimum at 198 nm ( Figure 3) . The shape of the spectra is characteristic of disordered peptides, consistent with the predictions described above that E-CTD adopts a disordered conformation in an aqueous solution.\n",
            " Further, to obtain insight into the conformational space accessible to the E-CTD, we performed extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations up to 1.5 µs. First, we generated an intial structure using homology modelling, finding a structure with -helices at 43CCNTV47 and 58VYSRVKNLNSS68, while the remaining regions are unstructured. During the simulations, the -helical content was reduced to 29% in E-CTD, and the unstructured region increased up to 71% (Figure 4) . The trend for the radius of gyration (Rg) also suggests a dynamic structure,\n",
            " with Rg values varying between 0.9 and 2.2 nm. The large fluctuations in the Rg, and correspondingly in the root mean square deviation (RMSD), is due to the unstructured Nterminal (residues 41-55) and C-terminal (residues 66-75) regions. These results are consistent with the CD spectra described above (Figure 3) , and with a previous intrinsic disorder analysis of E, which showed a high propensity of the intrinsic disorder [5] .\n",
            " It is well known that when certain IDPs approach lipid membranes, they can undergo transient structural changes and form -helical conformations [19] . Some IDPs can also remain unstructured despite binding with lipid membranes through their side chains [20] . To characterise the conformational properties of the E-CTD in the presence of lipid membranes, we used artificial large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) to mimic membranous environments.\n",
            " Since E interacts with different cell membranes, we studied how different membrane mimetics, including LUVs (DOPC and DOPS) and SDS micelles, influence the secondary structure of the E-CTD.\n",
            " We first used DOPC to construct neutral LUVs. Neutral lipids are commonly present at the cell membrane outer leaflet, which is involved in interaction and fusion with a virus [21, 22] .\n",
            " Moreover, the Golgi and ER membrane compartments contain a sizeable fraction of neutral lipids [23] . We found that the CD spectra of the E-CTD in the presence of DOPC LUVs exhibited a signature minimum shifted from 198 nm to 218 or 220 nm ( Figure 5A,B) . This result indicates a change in the E-CTD secondary structure, with a gain of β-sheet structure.\n",
            " Since anionic lipids, such as phosphatidylserine, is most commonly found on cytosolic leaflets of Golgi and ER membranes, which are involved in intracellular secretory vesicle trafficking [21, 22] , we used DOPS to construct anionic LUVs. In this case, the CD spectra of the E-CTD shows a signature minimum at 218 nm, characteristic of proteins with a high content of β-sheet structure ( Figure 5B ). As the concentration of DOPS increased, the signature minimum becomes deeper, suggesting increased β-sheet content. By performing a DichroWeb analysis, we determined the secondary structure content ( Table 3) .\n",
            " Further global conformational dynamics of the E-CTD was assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy and lifetime measurement. Fluorescence spectra show a significant reduction in fluorescence intensity with increasing DOPC concentrations, while the intensity increases with increasing DOPS concentrations ( Figure 6 ). These changes in intensity indicate overall conformational changes in the presence of LUVs. The opposite scenarios in the cases of DOPS and DOPC might be due to the total charge on the LUVs, which causes the E-CTD to change the conformation differently.\n",
            " Next, to examine the charge of the LUVs by the E-CTD, we measured the zeta potential. We found that the charge of DOPC LUVs was 1.9 ± 0.2 mV, while in presence of 5 µM and 20 µM E-CTD it was slightly reduced to 0.5 ± 0.2 mV and to 0.3 ± 0.1 mV, respectively (Table   1) . Furthermore, the zeta potential of E-CTD in presence of DOPS LUVs was found to be -26.3 ± 2.3 mV, while in presence of 5 µM and 20 µM E-CTD, it was -25.9 ± 1.1 mV and -34.7 ± 4.0 mV, respectively ( Table 1 ). The analysis of the charge of the LUVs reflects small but significant differences in the presence or absence of the E-CTD. These difference suggest that the E-CTD interaction may perturb the lipid membrane by inducing conformational changes.\n",
            " These changes may occur due to specific inter-molecular interactions of the E-CTD with lipid molecules or salt-bridge interactions, or intra-chain hydrogen bonds [4] . The E-CTD contains the highly conserved cysteine-containing motif CxxC that may allow disulfide isomerization to enhance membrane-directed conformational changes [19] . Moreover, it contains different potent glycosylation sites essential for maintaining the protein broad functional roles and may act as chaperone interacting motifs to help in the protein folding [8, 17, 41] . The PDZ-binding domain (PBM) motif DLLV at the end of E-CTD plays a crucial role in host cell modifications required for viral infection and pathogenesis [8, 24] . The presence of these motifs in the E-CTD may induce membrane-directed conformational changes, which are likely to be relevant in the infectious cycle [37] .\n",
            " SDS micelles mimic the interface between hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments, thus enabling the study of protein-membrane interactions [24] [25] [26] . SDS is found in micellar form above the critical micellar concentration (CMC) in aqueous conditions (CMC is ~2 mM for SDS micelles in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7), while below the CMC, SDS exists in its monomeric forms [27] . It has been reported that E is dynamic at the membrane interfaces [6] .\n",
            " Here, a substantial change in the shape of CD spectra is seen in the presence of 0.1 mM SDS micelles ( Figure 7A,B) . The difference is prominent at 0.5 mM and above the CMC (5 mM and 50 mM). The spectra in the presence of 0.1-5 mM SDS micelles show a signature minima near 220 nm, which becomes deeper with an increase in SDS micelles, suggesting the gain of -sheet. Also, in the presence of 0.5 and 5 mM SDS micelles, the spectra show a second minimum near 208 nm, suggesting an -helix gain. Therefore, at 0.5 and 5 mM, the spectra represent a structure with both -strand and -helical propensity. Instead, at higher concentrations of SDS micelles, the spectra exhibit two minima at 222 nm and 208 nm, which indicate the gain of only -helical structure. Further, the CD deconvolution results by DICHROWEB confirm the decrease in disordered content and an increase in the ordered structural content ( Table 3) with increasing SDS micelles.\n",
            " Further, the conformational changes observed by fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that with an increasing SDS micelles concentration, the E-CTD shows an increase in fluorescence intensity without a shift in peak position (Figure 7C,D) . This change in fluorescence intensity may be due to the E-CTD conformational dynamics after interaction with SDS micelles, leading to tyrosine residue exposure. This fluorescence-based result was further confirmed by the lifetime measurement of the tyrosine fluorescence. Any changes in fluorophore physicochemical environments (tyrosine in case of the E-CTD) lead to the change in its property and, consequently, the fluorescence lifetime ( Table 2) . Our findings thus reveal interactions with SDS micelles leading to significant changes in the secondary structure and tertiary structure of E-CTD.\n",
            " Further, to explore the disorder to order transition in the E-CTD, we used trifluoroethanol (TFE), an organic solvent known to induce α-helical secondary structure in proteins. The amphiphilic TFE molecules surround a protein, weakening the hydrogen bonding of water to the CO and NH groups in the coil form [28] . This process leads to dehydration of the protein backbone, which causes the formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds and therefore induces the formation of α-helical structure [29] [30] [31] . Other studies also proposed that TFE act to destabilize the unfolded state by structuring the solvent, leading to an elevated folded population [32, 33] . We measured CD spectra of the E-CTD in varying concentrations of TFE ( Figure 8A) . As TFE concentration increases, the signature minimum at 198 nm is progressively lost, and new signature minima appear at 208 nm and 222 nm ( Figure 8B) . These results indicate that the E-CTD acquires an α-helical structure in the presence of TFE. A percentage secondary structure analysis by DICHROWEB shows a gain of α-helix content to 99% at 90% TFE (Table 3) . Further, fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated that the E-CTD displays an increase in intensity upon increasing TFE concentrations ( Figure 8C ).\n",
            " Osmolytes are naturally occurring low molecular weight organic molecules that help evade stress conditions and regulate several biological processes such as protein folding, proteinprotein interactions, and protein disaggregation [34] [35] [36] . Since stress conditions could follow SARS-CoV-2 infection, we investigated the effects of osmolytes on the conformational properties of the E-CTD. The far-UV CD spectra of E-CTD in the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), an organic compound that stabilizes structured states of proteins, show an increased β-strand content, which is evident from the observed CD signal at 218 nm ( Figure   9A ). In the presence of TMAO, the E-CTD exhibits a change in the structural conformation into an ordered form. We also observed a transition from 0 M TMAO to 2.5 M TMAO. At 0.2 M TMAO, the E-CTD shows reduced negative ellipticity but does not show a significant change in ellipticity at 222 nm (Figure 9B ). At 1 M and above, a gradual increase in ellipticity at 222 nm indicates increased β-strand content. Disordered proteins have been shown to fold in the presence of TMAO [37] [38] [39] . However, some IDPs exhibit a different behaviour [40, 41] , as they only exhibit a reduction in negative ellipticity at 198-202 nm. Overall, these results indicate that the E-CTD in the presence of TMAO undergoes a transition from disorder to ordered (Figure 9) . Moreover, these structural changes were further confirmed by intrinsic fluorescence experiments that show a reduction in fluorescence intensity with increasing TMAO concentration.\n",
            " Temperature-induced structural changes are common among IDPs, including a conformational ensemble compaction [11, 42] . To investigate the temperature-induced structural changes in the E-CTD, we recorded far-UV CD spectra at increasing temperatures (10 ºC to 90 ºC, at 5 ºC intervals). We observed typical CD spectra for disordered proteins at low temperatures.\n",
            " However, upon increasing the temperature, the shape of the CD spectra changed (Figure 10A) .\n",
            " A significant gain in negative ellipticity nearby 222 nm, and a loss of negative ellipticity around 198 nm, were observed ( Figure 10B ). This type of temperature-driven structural change is known to derive from structural compaction, as observed in other disordered proteins and peptides [39, 41, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . However, other studies on IDPs showed that disordered proteins may lose their α-helical structure with increasing temperature, suggesting that the α-helices are not solely responsible for the spectroscopic change detected by the CD spectroscopy [11] . Thus, the temperature-induced change in the E-CTD may be interpreted as heating-induced folding of the E-CTD into α-helical structures.\n",
            " Furthermore, to study the influence of temperature on the secondary structure of the E-CTD in the presence of lipid membranes (DOPC and DOPS LUVs), we recorded CD spectra with varying temperatures (Figure 10) . At room temperature, DOPC and DOPS LUVs induce ordered secondary structure in the E-CTD (Figures 5 and 6) , and the shape of spectra remains the same irrespective of temperature increase. The presence of lipids stabilizes the β-sheet in the E-CTD even at higher temperatures confirming the interaction between the E-CTD and lipids.\n",
            " The fluorescent dyes ThT and ANS show strong binding to E-CTD aggregates (Figure 11A,   B) . ANS shows a significant blue shift upon binding E-CTD aggregates compared with controls and freshly dissolved E-CTD. It also represents secondary structural changes (Figure 11C) , a reduction in spectral ellipticity were observed along with a shift of spectra to gain ordered structure. Using AFM, we confirmed the presence of amyloid-like fibrils after incubation for 45 days of the E-CTD under physiological conditions (Figure 11D) , with a height of approximately 1.3 nm (Figure 11F ).\n",
            " We have investigated the structural basis for the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E) with host cell membranes. We have shown that the C-terminal domain of E (E-CTD) in solution is intrinsically disordered, but also that it changes dramatically its structural behavior in the presence of membrane mimetics, osmolytes, and organic solvents. We have observed that the E-CTD exhibits a structural transition from disorder to order upon interacting with LUVs, SDS micelles, TMAO and TFE. The E-CTD adopts an -helical structure in TFE, a -sheet structure in DOPS and DOPC LUVs, indicating that lipid membranes may influence its secondary structure. These conformational changes may have an important role in the viral infection cycle. In addition, upon incubation at physiological conditions, the E-CTD formed amyloid-like fibrils.\n",
            " These results indicate that the E-CTD can respond to changes of environmental conditions by adopting different conformations, a dynamic behavior that may be critical for viral infectivity.\n",
            " We anticipate that to fully elucidate the heterogeneous nature of the SARS-CoV-2 E-CTD, further studies will be needed to link mechanistically the conformational dynamics in viral pathogenesis. \n",
            " As no structure is currently available for the E-CTD, initial models were generated using the PepFold web server using 200 simulations of energy minimization. The starting model for the MD simulations was built and then prepared using Chimera by employing a previously described protocol [41, 47] . To examine the conformational space accessible to the E-CTD, we performed all-atom MD simulations up to 1.5 µs using the Charmm36 force field [49] in Gromacs v5 [50] , as reported previously [51] . In the presence of TIP3P water model, 0.15M NaCl, and solvation neutralizing counterions, the structure of the E-CTD was prepared and minimized using steepest descent method. With NVT and NPT equilibration at 300 K and 1 bar pressure, the system was equilibrated. Using Nose-Hoover and Parrinello-Rahman coupling methods, the average temperature at 300 K and pressure at 1 bar were maintained during the simulations. The final production run was performed for 1.5 µs using the high performing cluster at IIT Mandi.\n",
            " The benzothiazole dye thioflavin T (ThT) is a frequently used probe for in vitro amyloid fibril formation by proteins/peptides [52] . ThT forms highly fluorescent complexes with amyloid fibrils and does not interact with the globular proteins in a native state [53] . In this study, we used ThT to identify fibril formation by the E-CTD. 20\n",
            " μM ThT was mixed with 50 μM E-CTD samples (monomeric and aggregated) in sodium phosphate buffer (20 mM phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated for five minutes in the dark. Emission spectra were recorded in triplicate at 450 nm excitation wavelength and emission scan from 470 nm to 700 nm in a TECAN Infinite M200 PRO microplate reader. The final spectra represent the average of three spectra.\n",
            " The ANS dye was used to detect partially folded intermediates such as molten globules and measuring the exposed hydrophobic surface during amyloid fibril formation [54] .

            "Title: The Importance of Glycans of Viral and Host Proteins in Enveloped Virus Infection\n",
            "Body Text: Animal viruses are parasites of animal cells that have characteristics such as heredity and replication, and are mainly composed of DNA or RNA, proteins and in some, a lipid membrane with glycoproteins (1) . Commonly, viruses achieve invasion and infection with the help of the synthetic machinery of host cells. Viruses can be divided into two groups depending on whether they have a lipid bilayer membrane on their outer surface or not: enveloped viruses and nonenveloped viruses. Enveloped viruses have a lipid bilayer that comes from the host cell. It incorporates receptor attachment proteins and membrane fusion proteins that are both encoded by the virus. And all attachment or fusion proteins of enveloped viruses are modified by glycosylation. Glycosylation is important for the life cycle of the virus and plays essential roles in stability, antigenicity and infectivity of viruses (2) . We summarize the functions of common enveloped viral glycoproteins in Table 1 .\n",
            " Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications of proteins, and there are two main types: N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation ( Figure 1 ). N-glycosylation means that Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in an oligosaccharide binds covalently to the polypeptide chain by an Nglycoside linkage with the amide nitrogen of an asparagine residue in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X is any amino acid other than proline). The main type of O-glycosylation is the mucin-type O-glycosylation, which means that N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) bonds covalently to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residues replacing the hydrogen in the hydroxyl group to form an (12) . The formation and extension of glycans requires the synergistic completion of two types of glycan processing enzymes, one is glycosyltransferase which catalyzes the formation of glycoside linkages, and another is glycosidase which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycoside linkages (13) .\n",
            " The entry of a virus into a host cell is closely related to the glycans on its own structural proteins. The glycoproteins of some viruses play an important role in host infection, especially in the recognition of the host cell and the interaction with other molecules in the cell after the attachment (14) . Furthermore, due to the fact that viruses can fully depend on cellular host cells These viral glycoprotein are classified as: (1) GP, glycoprotein; (2) HA, hemagglutinin; (3) E, enveloped proteins; (4) prM, premembrane; (5) S, spike protein.\n",
            " FIGURE 1 | Glycoconjugates that formed by carbohydrates are covalently bonded to proteins and lipids on mammalian cell membranes. Proteins can be glycosylated and covalently bound to a polypeptide chain via an N-glycoside linkage to Asn or via an O-glycoside linkage to Ser/Thr. N-linked glycans share a common pentasaccharide core structure, which is composed of two GlcNAc and three mannoses. The main type of O-linked glycosylation is the mucin-type Oglycosylation, which has N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) as a common core. Glycosphingolipids are ubiquitous molecules that formed via the covalent linkage between a glycan moiety and a ceramide.\n",
            " for their reproduction, thus, they must complete glycosylation with the help of host glycoprotein synthesis mechanism (1, 15) . Viral glycoproteins are involved in many important biological processes, such as protein folding and stabilization, viral infection and invasion, recognition of host receptors and immune escape of the virus from the immune system (16) .\n",
            " With the development of glycan-related research technology, the research and development of novel virus vaccines and antiviral drugs modified by glycosylation are receiving increasing attention. In this review, we will explore the effects of glycosylation of host and virus proteins on virus biological behavior, with the aim of providing a reference for the prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases.\n",
            " The life cycle of enveloped viruses includes the processes of adsorption, penetration, uncoating, biosynthesis, assembly and release. Figure 2 summarizes the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.\n",
            " Viral replication depends on successful infection of the host cells. The replication cycle starts with a virus particle attaching to a specific receptor on the surface of a host cell, and viral entry can be realized by endocytosis (non-enveloped or enveloped viruses), membrane fusion (enveloped viruses) or direct fusion with the plasma membrane (20, 21) . After internalization, the capsid is released into the cytoplasm with negative strand viruses, it is uncoating the nucleocapsid, which will be copied to produce the antigenome which itself is then used to transcribe many copies of the genome, or mRNA that are translated into viral proteins (17, 18) . The viral glycopeptides are translated on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where the N-linked glycans are added and transported through the Golgi complex where the N-linked glycans are modified and the O-glycans are added (22, 23) . At the same time, the viral genome with its associated proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus, where they are released outside the cell by exocytosis after maturation (24) . Glycoproteins are essential for the infectivity of the virions that have them.\n",
            " The glycoproteins in the membrane of enveloped viruses bind specifically to the receptors on the cell membrane and cause membrane fusion enabling virus contents to enter the cell. In this process, the surface glycans of the virus can be involved in initiating the recognition of host cells and thus affect the organs and the cells that in the organs. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is an enveloped virus, and its envelope contains of gp120 surface protein and gp41 transmembrane protein. Moreover, gp120 is one of the most highly glycosylated proteins in nature. It accounts for approximately 50% of the total mass (25) . These glycans not only affect the conformation of the envelope but also affect the entry and infectivity of the virus. It is generally believed that HIV-1 gp120 promotes viral entry by sequentially binding to CD4 and chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 on target cells (26) . However, there have been many reports that gp120 can bind to various cell types independently of CD4. Some HIV-1 isolates were able to infect CD4-negative but CCR5 expressing cells due to the deficiency of Asn 197 in gp120, which leads to the exposure of the CCR5-binding region of gp120, thus HIV-1 can enter cells (27) . Similarly, the binding of virus to CD4 was reduced significantly by removing the glycan chains from gp120 by endoglycosidase treatment or Nglycosylation site mutation (28, 29) . In contrast, in Vero cells, removing the N-glycan near the highly conserved receptor binding domain on the envelope glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus (EBOV) increased GP-mediated virus entry efficiency (30) . Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the surface glycoproteins of influenza A virus. Influenza virus attaches to the surface of a host cell when its HA protein interacts with the terminal sialic acid (SA) of the host cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids. On the other hand, NA can cleave SA residues from glycoproteins of the enveloped virus itself and enhance infectivity by preventing aggregation of virus particles (31) . NA may also act on the SA residues of host mucin to gain access to the epithelial cells, playing a secondary role in helping viruses to enter host cells (32) .\n",
            " One of the key roles of protein glycosylation is its effect on folding, structure, transport, and stability (33) . Glycans can be structurally integrated into protein folding, and the interaction between the glycan and protein could stabilize the protein. Besides, glycans can also assist glycoprotein folding in the biosynthetic process by mediating interactions with chaperones (34) . Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) act as chaperones to facilitate the correct folding of viral proteins. In cells, when all nascent N-glycans added to a protein, they have three terminal glucose residues. These residues will be removed sequentially, with a -glucosidase I (aGI) removing the outermost glucose residue and a-glucosidase II (aGII) removing the next two residues produce the immature GlcMan9GlcNAc2 N-glycans (35) . CNX and CRT have a lectin domain, and this domain can specifically bind to immature GlcMan 9 GlcNAc 2 N-glycans on misfolded proteins and recruit ATP, calcium, and protein disulfide isomerase A3 to promote the folding of glycoproteins, thereby regulating glycoprotein entry into the CNX/CRT folding cycle (36, 37) .\n",
            " Glycans on enveloped virus surface proteins can not only facilitate the folding of proteins but can also affect their transport. During HIV-1 replication, a high mannose type gp160 trimer assembles in the rough ER of host cells, and then gp160 is transported to the Golgi apparatus and cleaved by a furinlike protease in the late Golgi to its mature gp120 and gp41 proteins which remain associated (38, 39) . HIV-1 gp41 contains four N-glycosylation sites, removing of Asn 332 in gp41 can disrupt the proteolytic processing and the transportation of gpl60 (40, 41) . Herpes simplex viruses 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex viruses 2 (HSV-2) are globally prevalent pathogens, which often lead to recurrent oral and genital ulcers (42) . HSV encodes at least 12 different glycoproteins, and at least four of them are necessary and sufficient to mediate membrane fusion when they infect target cells, namely glycoprotein B (gB), gD, gH and gL (43) (44) (45) . Similarly, mutations of N390, N483 or N668 in total seven potential N-glycosylation sites on gB of HSV-2 can reduce the ability of cell-cell fusion and virus entry. However, the mutation of N133 mainly prevents the transport of gB from the ER to the Golgi, thus affecting protein expression and the production of infectious virions (46) .\n",
            " Enveloped viruses mainly release their progeny by budding. Their envelope is derived from the host cell membrane, and the glycan on viral proteins can affect the release of progeny virions. For example, gC of HSV-1 mediates the attachment of HSV-1 to susceptible host cells by interacting with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) on the cell surface. Also, gC contains a mucin-like domain (MLD) located near the GAG binding site, which may affect the binding activity between the virus and GAG. HSV-1 mutants that lack these MLDs in gC and found that compared with natural HSV-1, the binding affinity of virions to the cell was reduced and the release ability of mutant virus particles from the surface of infected cells was also reduced (47) . Similarly, glycosylation sites on the premembrane protein and enveloped proteins of West Nile virus (WNV) are cell typedependent or even species-dependent and affect the release of virus and infection efficiency (10) .\n",
            " Moreover, some viruses have even evolved glycosidases to promote virus release (48) . The most obvious example is that influenza virus NA cleaves SA residues from the surface of host cells, thereby reducing and weakening the ability of HA to bind to host cell glycoprotein receptors (49, 50) . During the process of virus budding from the cell plasma membrane, HA proteins continue to bind virions to SA residues on the cell surface until the NA sialidase activity removes terminal SA residues.\n",
            " During the process of viral evolution, viruses develop different glycosylation modifications, and N-glycosylation sites of proteins are added or deleted, these alterations can have an appreciable impact on the survival and transmissibility of a virus (16) . For example, adding an N-glycosylation site to the HA protein can increase the sensitivity of the respiratory system to innate immune protein production, and reduce the transmissibility of influenza A viruses (51) (52) (53) . Similarly, N-glycan of HIV gp120 is also of vital importance to viral infection and transmission (54) . The majority of HIV N-glycan deficient mutants show decreased infectivity and transmission efficiency (N156Q, N197Q, N332Q, N386Q), but two of the N-glycan mutants (N230Q and N295Q) show increased infectivity and transmission efficiency (54) . SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing a health crisis, the magnitude of which is rare in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 virus spike (S) glycoprotein is highly glycosylated, if the glycosylation sites of both N331 and N343 are mutated at the same time, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 can be significantly reduced, suggesting that their glycans are important for viral infectivity (55) .\n",
            " In addition, replication of the same virus in different cells can generate different glycosylation, which severely affects the transmission ability of the virus (56) . For example, HIV from different cell lines has different glycosylation in its envelope proteins, and the glycosylation difference affects its interaction with Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). HIV from T cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells was well bound and transmitted by DC-SIGN, whereas HIV from macrophages was poorly bound and transmitted (57, 58) .\n",
            " Enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1, influenza virus, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 are a great threat to humans. The envelope proteins of these viruses are heavily glycosylated, and these glycans can hide an antigenic epitope to thereby avoiding recognition by neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against that site and providing a convenient way for viruses to infect host cells and to promote immune escape. There are two main mechanisms by which viruses can escape the nAbs response.\n",
            " Despite major efforts to produce a vaccine for HIV-1, it is unfortunate that all of the traditional methods of vaccine preparation have generated little expected effect due to the great diversity of HIV-1 strains (59) . Only a minority of people produce nAbs after receiving HIV vaccines. Mutation of Asn 332 in gp120 after HIV infection and also nAbs that target this site were detected in the sera from two people who had responded to an HIV vaccine (a recombinant glycoprotein 120 vaccine), suggesting that HIV antigenic sites are blocked by glycans, resulting in most people failing to produce broadly nAbs (60) . Similarly, patients with acute HIV infection do not produce detectable nAbs until at least 52 days after infection. Hardly any mutations were detected in the envelope proteins of the viruses that successfully escaped after nAbs suppression, while an increase in N-glycosylation was detected (61) . Moreover, one of the two N-glycosylation sites of Ebola virus GP2 is mutated, which is very adverse to the antigenicity and immunogenicity of GP (62) . All of these observations illustrate that highly glycosylated modifications can shield the antigenic sites of the virus and present challenges to antiviral therapy.\n",
            " Antigenic drift is a small variation in antigens caused by mutations in the genome, without new subtypes generation, but it often promotes immune escape and leads to the greater scope of the spreading, which often occurs in influenza viruses. H1N1 broke out in 1918/1919, infecting nearly half of the world's population, with a mortality rate of 2.5%~5%, at least 50 million people died (63) . Ninety-one years later, in April 2009, the new H1N1 virus appeared and spread rapidly around the world, causing an estimated 280,000 deaths worldwide. Low immunity of the population to the novel H1N1 strain was the main reason that led to its mass epidemic. HA is an effective target for nAbs, and mutations in the antigenic sites in its globular head region promote the immune escape of the virus. A complete analysis of the amino acid sequence of the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses showed that the HA of these viruses can be glycosylated at the conserved glycosylation sites (64, 65) . It was reported that highly glycosylated seasonal Influenza A viruses are inactivated by soluble lectins of the innate immune system (66) . Compared with seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses, the HA globular regions of epidemic H1N1 are often modified by a low degree of glycosylation, which correlates with a greater difference at the amino acid level seen at or near the known antigenic sites located in the globular head of the HA (67, 68) . Furthermore, that only influenza (H1N1) shows antigenic drift compared to several other RNA viruses that infect the respiratory tract (69) . These antigenic drifts contribute to the immune escape of H1N1, contributing in part to the flu vaccine failing to provide protection (70) .\n",
            " There are many glycans in virus surface glycoproteins, and they affect the virulence of the virus by regulating the binding of the virus to host receptors, covering up antigenic sites, or stimulating host immune responses to affect virulence (71) . These glycans play different roles in the virulence of the virus.\n",
            " Rabies viruses (RABVs) are non-segmented, negativestranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae. The RABV genome encodes five structural proteins: nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, GP, and large transcriptase protein (9) . GP is the only viral transmembrane protein that is exposed on the virion surface that interacts and the target cell receptor. The GP of most RABVs has two N-glycosylation sites, Asn 37 and Asn 319 . The N-glycan at Asn 37 plays a role in promoting the propagation of the virus but also reduces the pathogenicity of the virus (53) . Similarly, the addition of a single N-glycan at Asn 194 or Asn 247 also reduced the pathogenicity of street rabies viruses, confirmed by peripheral infection in mice (72) . Furthermore, the virulence of H1N1 for mice decreased with an increase in the number of HA glycosylation sites (64) .\n",
            " On the other hand, the glycans of viral proteins can also enhance their virulence. For example, glycosylated and nonglycosylated E proteins of WNV are neurovirulent. However, viruses containing glycosylated E proteins are more neuroinvasive in BALB/c mice (73) . Otherwise, the adding N-glycosylation of amino acids at either 154 or 156 increase neuro-invasiveness in mice, avian virulence, and vector competence (74) .\n",
            " The specific binding of a virus to host receptor is a prerequisite for viral infection, and the viral glycans responsible for attachment and cell receptors of viruses play a decisive role. Many studies have focused on the functions of glycans on the viral protein: such as host cell recognition, replication, infection and immune escape. However, hosts and viruses have coevolutionary relationships, thus the functions of host receptors are also crucial, and all viruses must interact with the specific receptors when they enter a cell. The specificity of host receptors is considered to be one of the major factors in determining host range and tissue tropism. Host receptor refers to a component of the host cell membrane that can bind specifically to the virus, mediate virus entry, and promote virus infection. Its chemical nature is a glycoprotein, proteoglycan, lipid, or glycolipid (75, 76) . According to their different functions, virus receptors can be divided into two categories: attachment factors and entry receptors (77) . Entry receptors can bind to the virus and mediate the internalization of the virus, for example, HIV can bind to CD4. Attachment factors concentrate viruses on the cell surface and play an auxiliary role in the process of virus infection (78) . For example, heparin sulfate, which is proteoglycan widely found on various cell surfaces and extracellular matrix in the body, can act as an auxiliary receptor of SARS-CoV-2 to promote the entry of virus (79) . Therefore, glycans on a host cell receptor can play an important role in influencing viral infection as a functional receptor or attachment factor for the virus.\n",
            " SA is a naturally existing nine-carbon monosaccharide and has been identified as a functional receptor attached to the termini of N-glycans or O-glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids (80) . SA is one of the first sites for the contact between many pathogens and hosts because it presents on the outer surface of cells and mucosal tissues. SA carried by most mammals is called Nglycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) ( Figure 3A) ; however, our ancestors also evolved another kind of SA, called Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), probably to resist the malaria parasite that was able to use Neu5Gc to enter the human body at that time. After completing this evolution, making some diseases seem more particularly specific to humans, such as typhoid, cholera, mumps, pertussis, asthma, and coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) (81) . When SARS-CoV-2 enters the human body, it recognizes SA first, and search for its receptor at the same time, then it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), opening the access into the cell (82, 83) .\n",
            " Usually, SA exists as a bound sugar at the terminal positions of glycans via different glycosidic linkages (a2,3, a2,6, and a2,8) . Figure 3B shows common SA linkage types. SA can be found in almost all animals, but the virus cannot infect all animals that have SA. Besides, different viruses infect different hosts by employing different receptors, which may be determined by the diversification of SA residue linkage types ( Figure 3B) , that is, viruses have a specific selectivity in the process of infecting the host. For example, the influenza virus binds to the receptor by recognizing SA residue at the terminal position of the receptor glycoprotein glycan chain, but it has the preference for certain types of SA (such as Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac). The preferential binding property may be attributed to the changes in the penultimate galactose residue linkage to SA. Avian influenza virus mainly binds to a2,3-linked SA residue, while human influenza virus preferentially binds to a2,6-linked SA residue (84, 85) .\n",
            " Other glycans can also act as viral receptors to influence the entry of viruses, such as heparan sulfate, which can act as an initial adhesion receptors for various viruses, so it can help the virus adhere to the cells and mediate entry before the virus binds to the high-affinity receptors. HSV entry begins with the attachment of the virus to target cells through binding of HSV gC and/or gB to heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 or syndecan-2 of the epithelial cell surface. Then, via various cell surface receptors such as nectin-1 or nectin-2. Finally, the attached virus begins to enter the cells (86) (87) (88) . Like HSV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters cells by interacting with syndecan-1 or syndecan-4 on the surface of human hepatocytes to initiate its life cycle (89, 90) . As for HCV, its functional receptors include SRB1, CD81, CLDN1, and OCLN, among which CD81 is the most important (91) .\n",
            " Also, neutral glycans may act as virus receptors, such as histo-blood group antigens, which are present in red blood cells, epithelial cells, and mucosal secretions, and play an important role as attachment factors for Rotavirus and Norovirus (92, 93) .\n",
            " Faced with the threat of new viruses, the effective prevention measure that we can take is to control the source of infection, cut off the main route of transmission and protect the susceptible population, these measures will be essential to bring the situation under control and to alleviate the negative effects of the epidemic. The definitive solution is effective vaccines that induce uninfected people to generate protective antibody and build long-term immune memory to combat the virus if the vaccine ever comes in contact with that virus at a later time.\n",
            " Although we know that the envelope proteins in HIV are the only target for nAbs (94) , it is unfortunate that almost all of the traditional methods of vaccine preparation have generated little expected effect due to the great diversity of HIV-1 strains. Removal of the N-glycan modifications in the highly variable V1-V3 region of HIV-1 envelope protein improves the sensitivity of the virus to nAbs (95) . Similarly, the gp120 complex mutated at the glycosylation site N448E can activate antiviral immunity better than the gp120 wild type. This suggests that removing N-glycans can increase the effectiveness of HIV vaccine (3). However, the heterogeneity of the HIV envelope, viruses tend to escape from most neutralizing antibody responses. Currently, HIV vaccine development research is focused on inducing unique broadly nAbs to act on diverse strains of HIV-1.\n",
            " Because of the antigenic drift of influenza viruses, current influenza vaccines need to be updated annually. The number and length of glycans on HA can affect the immune response; reducing the length of glycans can induce nAbs to make a stronger immune response to antigenic epitopes (96) . The binding of nAbs to the HA glycans was inhibited at low temperature because the low temperature can stiffen the glycan structure (97) . Interestingly, increased density of viral glycans in oligosaccharide-modified influenza viruses can directly activate the immune response and there exists a class of conserved epitopes in influenza viruses, that after adding hyperglycosylated artificially will become dominant (It was verified by mice in vivo experiment) (98) . This finding suggests that further study on glycosylation of influenza virus HA protein can be helpful to develop antiviral drugs.\n",
            " Experimental vaccines against HSV-1 target particular viral glycoproteins. HSV envelope gD is expressed on the surface of the virus and induces a nAbs response. The largest current clinical trial of HSV subunit vaccines has found an inhibitory effect on HSV-1, but no effect against HSV-2 (99). A different attenuated vaccine strategy has been attempted by using HSV without glycoprotein D2, this vaccine can induce neutralizing antibody which displays antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity to achieve better protection from HSV infection (100, 101) .\n",
            " The GP of EBOV is the main target of nAbs. Most of the current research on Ebola vaccines uses GP as the immunogen. Mature GP is composed of GP1 and GP2. They are presented on the surface of virions as trimers of disulfide-linked GP1-GP2 heterodimers. The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap, and the MLD. The MLD is highly variable and contains both N-and O-linked glycans (30) . The MLD is essential for immune shielding, studies have shown that the MLD-deleted GP1 and GP2 can induce an immune response that may result in cross-species immunity (102) . Similarly, a subunit vaccine that contains the extracellular domain of the GP fused with the Fc fragment of human IgG1 to protect mice against EBOV lethal challenge (103). Further research found that mutation of Asn 565 on GP2 was highly detrimental to the immunogenicity of GP; However, mutation of two N-glycosylation sites on GP1 (388, 415 sites) may enhance immunogenicity (62) . Hence, the glycan on EBOV GP play an important role in inducing immunity, and further study of glycan may help us develop more effective vaccines.\n",
            " The S protein is the only antigen that is target of nAbs. The RNA vaccine that expecting S protein now aims to use all over the world. The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly glycosylated with 22 N-glycosylation sites (104) . However, in the face of mutant virus strains, existing vaccines are less effective (105, 106) . Deletion of the N331 and N343 glycosylation sites of SARS-CoV-2 S protein could significantly reduce the ability of the virus to infect, and mutations of N234Q and N165Q could markedly resist to nAbs and be more sensitive, respectively (55) . The functional study of different glycosylation sites on S protein may provide references for the development of effective vaccines and drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in the future.\n",
            " Glycans can affect the host cell recognition, replication, infection and immune escape of virus. With the deepening understanding of the structure and function of enveloped virus glycoproteins, research and development of antibody drugs that target enveloped virus glycoproteins have become a current hot topic (94) . Studies have shown that lectins can inhibit HIV-1 infection by binding directly to the viral glycans, thereby disrupting the receptor-induced conformational changes, inhibiting membrane fusion, and blocking the binding of DC-SIGN (107) (108) (109) . In addition, tetherin is a protein molecule on the surface of human cells that can block the spread of HIV and inhibit the release of a broad-spectrum of enveloped viruses by retaining virions on the surface of the infected cell. It has been reported that the antiviral activity of tetherin is related to its glycosylation. Human tetherin contains two putative N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn 65 and Asn 92 ), and glycosylation of at least one Asn of tetherin is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of HIV-1 release (110) . The use of mannosidase-I inhibitor such as kifunensine inhibits the biosynthesis of Nglycan and enhances proteolysis of S proteins, which reduces receptor-binding domain presentation on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, lowers the binding to host ACE2 and decrease viral entry (111) . In addition, other N-glycosylation inhibitors, like swainsonine, which is mannosidase II inhibitor and has been shown to be safe in humans, can cause N-glycan truncation may be used to reduce viral entry (112) . Iminosugars are known inhibitors of aGI and aGII, like celgosivir, castanospermine, and UV-4, which can effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture (113) . These drugs and compounds may be used to reduce viral load and moderate SARS-CoV-2 related respiratory symptoms.\n",
            " Other potential inhibitors that may modulate viral entry include carbohydrate-based small molecules (e.g. 4F-GlcNAC, 4F-GalNAC) and acceptor decoys (e.g. ONAP, SNAP) are used by interfering with the mutual recognition process of glycan and lectin (114) .\n",
            " Historically, viral diseases have repeatedly caused large-scale global public health concerns and threats to human health and survival. Figure 4 illustrates the transmission pathway of several common viruses that infect humans. Increasing evidence shows that the alterations in the N-glycan profile and sugar recognition pattern in host cells can reflect the progress of viral infection to some extent and are expected to be a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of viral infection (116) . In short, glycosylation can be a tool for the virus to infect the host and escape host immunity. Here, we have summarized the progress in studying the effects of glycan on viral behavior in recent decades, which will provide new insights for the development of viral vaccines and help to develop new targets to protect against these viruses. Finally, faced with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we need to identify the key therapeutic targets including glycosylation sites in vaccines and drug targets. With the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, although we have effective countermeasures, the mutated version of the virus still threatens the health safety of mankind. In general, the existing vaccines are still effective against the mutated virus, but the neutralization efficiency is lower (106) . How to develop a more effective vaccine has become an urgent task at present. As one of the most important post-translational modifications, glycosylation is an indispensable factor in virus function. Glycosylation inhibitors can significantly inhibit viral infection and reduce the synthesis of viral proteins (117) . We need to design a new vaccine virus by researching the glycosylation sites that have an impact on the viability of the virus, and modifying the glycosylation of the virus (118) . Similarly, it is also very important to study SARS-CoV-2 S glycans differ from typical host glycan processing and develop targeted glycosylation inhibitors. In addition, the use of this inhibitor in combination with other types of antiviral drugs may have a better effect in combating viral infection, replication and overcoming viral resistance (119).\n",

            "Title: Viral nanomechanics with a virtual atomic force microscope\n",
            "Body Text: Viruses are captivating nanoscale biological entities that in their simplest form are made by two essential components: a protein shell, also known as a capsid, and RNA or DNA as genetic material [1] . Despite this apparent simplicity, viruses are extremely efficient nanomachines capable of replicating with unparalleled efficiency in a wide variety of hosts and conditions. The most important role of the capsid is to protect the genetic material of the virus. During the extracellular phase viruses face large variations in environmental conditions that could induce extreme changes in temperature, pH, osmotic shocks related to a sudden alteration of salt concentration, or dehydration. In addition, the capsid of many double-stranded DNA viruses has to withstand up to tens of atmospheres of pressure built up during the packaging of the viral genome at high densities [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Moreover, extremophile viruses can live in extreme conditions of salinity, radiation or temperature [8] . Thus, it is very important that the capsid keeps its integrity under environmental changes and survives mechanical stresses during its life cycle. As a consequence viruses have developed amazing mechanical properties. Notable examples are bacteriophage φ29 that is capable of withstanding about 50 atms of pressure inside [5, 7, 9] ; or cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) that tolerates broad pH ranges and deformations of more than 30% without breaking [10, 11] .\n",
            " In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in characterizing the mechanical properties of individual viruses [12] . These studies have been possible by the development and application of different single-molecule experimental techniques. In particular, optical tweezers have been crucial in measuring the forces associated to the packing of the genome [7] . But, arguably, the most important and popular tool has been the application of the atomic force microscope (AFM) to obtain the mechanical resistance and topography of individual capsids [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . AFM nanoindentation experiments have determined different mechanical properties of viruses, including effective Young's modulus [13] , breaking patterns and forces [18] , fatigue [19] or even internal pressures [9] .\n",
            " AFM experiments are a very powerful tool to access mechanical information of viral capsids, but it is often very hard to get a good interpretation of the results and to relate this information to the biological characteristics of viruses. In this context, theor etical modeling and simulations are required to achieve a better understanding of experimental AFM results [20] .\n",
            " The goal of this article is precisely to introduce a 'Virtual AFM', i.e. a coarse-grained simulation mimicking the standard setup and experimental protocol of AFM nanoindentation experiments. Instead of placing the focus on the finest structural details of the nanoindentation of a specific virus, the aim is to provide a highly coarse-grained description, allowing to simulate large viruses at realistic timescales and with the advantage of being able to link the mechanical behavior to the essential physical ingredients of the interaction between capsid's structural units. With the VAFM one can get a better understanding of the mechanical response of viral capsids and how it will be influenced by changes in structure, loading or environmental conditions. This article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes the basics of AFM nanoindentation experiments in the study of viral capsids. Section 3 will be devoted to the description and implementation of the 'Virtual AFM', a Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulation mimicking the typical set up of single virus nanoindentation experiments. A detailed explanation of the main parameters of the interactions in the coarse-grained model and how they could be obtained from experiments and full-atom simulations is also provided. Next, we will show how the elastic response of viruses depends on different physical parameters of their effective interactions, including the bending rigidity of the shell, the adsorption to the substrate, the radius of the AFM tip or the capsid shape. Finally, our main findings are summarized in the conclusions.\n",
            " The application of AFM has become a revolution in the study of the mechanical properties of viruses [15] . The AFM is a highresolution imaging technique that allows an exquisite control of the height, position, and force in the study of individual viruses. With it, it is possible to acquire nanometric-resolution images, and also to perform a physical characterization of the rigidity of the sample. AFM can also be used in liquids, thus facilitating the study of biological samples in their natural environment.\n",
            " AFM nanoindentation experiments are providing important information about the mechanical properties of viruses [12, 14, 16] . The use of this method on different viruses has revealed that they are mechanically robust structures with interesting elastic properties. As an example, bacteriophages have been found to have high effective Young's modulus, comparable to that of hard plastics [13] . The AFM is also being very helpful in order to infer the influence of the genetic material or other types of cargo [21] on the mechanical resistance and stability of capsids. Nanoindentation experiments comparing empty and full capsids have been performed on various viruses such as CCMV [10] , Minute Virus of Mice [22] , phages λ [23] and φ29 [9] , adenovirus [24] or herpes simplex virus [25, 26] . In addition, the mechanical changes induced by the maturation process in viruses such as moloney murine leukemia virus [27] , human immunodeficiency virus [28] , HK97 [29] or T7 [30] have also been studied.\n",
            " The basic set up of an AFM consists of a flat horizontal surface, that supports the sample and a small tip at the end of a cantilever which interacts with the sample. The position of the tip is controlled using a piezolectric device that can move the sample in all three directions by an applied electric voltage. In contact operation mode, when the tip touches the sample the cantilever suffers a deflection that is measured by a laser and a photodiode. From the deflection of the cantilever, one can get an accurate topographic image of the sample with nanometer resolution [15, 17] . The deflection can also be translated into a force with a resolution of about 10 pN, using the elastic constant of the cantilever, which can be determined using, for instance, Sader's method [31] .\n",
            " In a typical nanoindentation experiment, the sample is immobilized on a flat hard substrate. The cantilever is then lowered progressively, recording the force and deflection as a function of the vertical position of the tip [15] . A conventional experimental force curve as a function of the indentation is plotted in figure 1 . For small indentations a linear forceresponse can be observed allowing the determination of the particle's effective spring constant from the slope. For larger indentations one can observe a non-linear behavior followed by the presence of strong discontinuities in the force-indentation curve that are often attributed to the mechanical failure of the capsid. The maximum indentation is the value of the indentation at which the first sudden drop in the force occurs, and the corresponding value of the force is identified with the 'breaking force'. These three parameters, namely the effective spring constant, the maximum indentation and the breaking force, are the standard output of nanoindentation experiments. But the challenge is to translate these simple measures into meaningful intrinsic mechanical properties and to identify what are the actual processes responsible for the different features observed in the force-indentation curves.\n",
            " The mechanical information obtained by AFM experiments has traditionally been interpreted in the framework of continuum elasticity theory [32] . In the thin shell approx imation [13, 17, 33] , the elastic response of viral capsids depends on the competition between stretching and bending deformations and on the strength of the applied force (or depth of the applied indentation). One can distinguish two deformation regimes, corresponding to small and large indentation forces.\n",
            " For small deformations the behavior of the force versus indentation is linear and reversible. In these conditions, the mechanical behavior of the cantilever can be approximated as an ideal spring whose elasticity is described by Hooke's law:\n",
            " where F is the restoring force, which is equal to the force of tip-sample interaction, k c is the spring constant of the cantilever, and x is its deflection. The deformable sample can be considered like a spring in series with the cantilever. Using this approximation the effective elastic constant of the capsid is given by k cap = k c Sg Sv−Sg , where S g (nm V −1 ) is the slope of the cantilever deflection on the non-deformable substrate and S v (nm V −1 ) the slope of the cantilever deflection on the virus. Thus, in the small deformations regime, k cap is calculated from a linear fit of the force versus indentation curve. The spring constant of the virus k cap is related to the effective 3D Young's modulus E as [17, 34] :\n",
            " where μ is the Poisson's ratio, R is the radius of the capsid, and h its thickness. The previous relation is exact for a thin spherical shell indented by a point force. For a thick shell, the same formula is used, replacing the prefactor\n",
            " by an effective coefficient which in most cases is close to 1. Alternatively, the spring constant can be rewritten in terms of the 2D Young's modulus Y = Eh and the bending rigidity κ as [17, 35] \n",
            " For indentations δ larger than the shell thickness, inverse buckling occurs [35] . In this regime, the force is no longer linear, but rather goes as F ≈ √ δ. Inverse buckling is expected to happen when δ > h and when the force exceeds a critical value F inv ≈ κ/R. Applying even larger deformations eventually causes irreversible changes in the shell structure associated to bond ruptures.\n",
            " Some of the approximations involved in thin shell theory can be removed by the use of finite elements (FE) simulations to solve the complex 3D continuum elasticity equations [10, 13, 36] . Using FE, it has been possible to analyze the effect of the thickness of the capsid, to extract phenomenologically the effective Young's modulus, and even to account for the effect of inhomogeneities using refined meshes constructed from atomic maps of viruses [37] .\n",
            " The continuum mechanics description works well as a first approximation and has provided very useful information about the elastic properties of viruses. However, a continuum description cannot capture the discrete nature of subunits forming the capsid, which is very important for a correct mechanical description of viruses [38] . As an example, AFM experiments on bacteriophage T7 show an anisotropic stiffness in its mechanical response [30] that cannot be described with a continuum theory. Therefore, accounting for the discrete and inhomogeneous nature of the capsid is crucial to properly understand its stability and mechanical response.\n",
            " Different types of simulations, accounting for the discreteness of the capsid at diverse resolution levels, have been implemented in the literature. In particular, elastic network models have been used to study the buckling and deformation of viruses [35, 39, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] , but cannot easily account for breaking events. On the opposite extreme, full-atom or high-resolution, structure-based coarse-grained simulations of nanoindentation experiments are computationally very costly, specially when applied to large viruses [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . That is the reason why we developed our 'Virtual AFM' described in the next section. Using a high level of coarse-graining one can reach longer timescales and perform efficient simulations while retaining the essential ingredients of the interaction between viral capsid subunits. Our model can be considered as an intermediate approach between continuum descriptions, that ignore the discrete nature of viral capsid proteins and cannot describe virus breaking, and structure-based coarse-grained simulations. Our goal is to provide a physical interpretation of viral mechanics at a discrete level, rather than aiming at capturing all the structural details involved in the deformation of a specific virus.\n",
            " With the VAFM one can visualize the dynamics of the capsid during the nanoindentation and correlate the features observed in the force-indentation curves with actual physical changes in the capsid. The model can be used to study the mechanical properties of viruses of arbitrarily large T-number and viruses whose structure is not known with atomic resolution, thus being potentially very useful to get information on the stability and resistance of any virus.\n",
            " In order to reproduce nanoindentation experiments, we wanted to implement a simulation mimicking the typical AFM setup.\n",
            " Since we are interested in the response of the viral capsid and the dynamics of capsomers during the indentation process, we decided to use an algorithm based on BD simulations together with a coarse-grained model of a capsid that succesfully reproduces the structure and assembly of the lowest Caspar and Klug structures, as described in [53] . The model was specifically designed to study self-assembly, where a large number of capsomers and long time scales are required. At those conditions, the implementation of high-resolution coarse-grained models will be computationally very costly.\n",
            " Viral self-assembly is a complicated and virus-specific process, which however shows some universal features. The most remarkable one is that, despite the differences in shape, size, sequence and conformation of coat proteins among different viruses, they end up adopting a common set of architectures.\n",
            " That suggests the existence of common traits in the effective interactions that underlay and justify the ubiquitous prevalence of icosahedral structures [54] . In icosahedral viruses, the viral coat proteins are distributed in morphological units, called capsomers, made of five ('pentamers') or six ('hexamers') proteins.\n",
            " Although the interactions between individual proteins are presumably very complex, the effective capsomer-capsomer interactions are expected to be simpler and more isotropic. Accordingly, our model [53] is coarse-grained at the level of capsomers, i.e. pentamers and hexamers, which are the basic structural units of a viral shell. These capsomers are represented as effective spheres of two different diameters: σ h and σ p , reflecting the fact that hexamers and pentamers are made of a different number of proteins (six and five, respectively), see figure 2 (a). The goal is thus not to provide structurally-detailed information of each individual coat protein but rather to capture the essential physical traits of the effective interactions between capsid's morphological units. Three are the essential ingredients of the interactions required for a successful model of a capsid at this high level of coarse-graining. First, a short range repulsion is needed to mimic steric effects and prevent capsomer overlapping. Second, some kind of binding attraction is vital to keep the integrity of the capsid. Third, an orientational-dependent interaction is necessary to account for the anisotropy of capsomers and to form stable shell-structures rather than compact clusters. Accordingly, the interaction between capsomers is modeled using three contributions: a Mie-like, an angular, and a torsion potential, V = V LJ · V a · V tor . The Mie-like potential describes the binding and the excluded volume interaction between a pair of capsomers in terms of their relative distance, r ij . The expression used was\n",
            " where σ ij is the equilibrium distance corresponding to the minimum of the potential, r is the distance between capsomer Representation of a coarse-grained hexamer (green) and pentamer (red) used in the model, indicating the distance between their centers r ij (orange), the orientation vectors Ω i (violet) and Ω j (blue) and the angles used in the interaction potential. A white sphere is overlapped on each capsomer just for representation purpuses, to indicate its orientation.\n",
            " centers, ij is the binding energy between capsomers, and m and n represent the power of the repulsive and attractive interaction terms, respectively, which set the range of the interaction potential. The angular term of the potential is given by\n",
            " where θ ij is the angle between the vector Ω i , describing the spatial orientation of the capsomer, and the vector r ij (see figure 2 (b)). The parameter ν is the preferred angle of interaction between proteins of different capsomers, which ultimately defines the size of the shell, and the parameter α controls the local bending stiffness, i.e. the energy cost required to bend two capsomers out of their preferred angle of interaction.\n",
            " Finally, the last contribution to the potential is a torsion term included to account for the differences between the inner and outer surface of coat proteins, and to favor the formation of closed shells instead of connected surfaces with different concavity. This contribution is given by\n",
            " where k t is the torsion constant and ξ is the angle between the planes defined by vector r ij and both orientation vectors (see figure 2 (b)). The model has been implemented in a BD simulation code using reduced units and a simple stochastic Euler's integration algorithm. In the standard version of this algorithm, the position of a particle at a time t + dt is given by\n",
            " where η is the friction coefficient, D is the diffusion coefficient, F i (t) is the force on particle i, and ξ is a Gausssian distributed random number with zero mean and variance 1. For simplicity, we will use reduced units, normalizing all variables in terms of the diameter of hexamers σ ≡ σ h , the diffusion coefficient of hexamers D, and the binding energy between hexamers 0 ≡ hh . In these reduced units, the characteristic time is τ = σ 2 /D, and using Stokes-Einstein equation D = kBT η to eliminate η, Euler's algorithm can be written in a simple way. More specifically, at time t + dt , the positions r(t) and angles (θ(t) and φ(t)) for each capsomer are given by\n",
            " where T is the temperature in reduced units, dt is the time step (typically dt = 10 −5 ), ξ r , ξ θ , and ξ φ are Gaussian distributed random numbers with zero mean a variance 1. The translational and orientational forces F r (t), F θ (t) and F φ (t) are calculated from the interaction potential between capsomers. Further details and the explicit expressions of the forces can be found in [55] . It is worth emphasizing that the model can reproduce successfully the structure and assembly of the lowest T-number viral shells without requiring any additional constraints, templates or local rules. Finally, a nice characteristic of the model is that the interaction parameters can be connected to elastic modulus in the continuum limit. In particular, the 2D Young's modulus is approximately given by [53] \n",
            " and the bending rigidity is\n",
            " In the continuum limit, the elastic behavior of a thin shell depends ultimately on a single non-dimensional parameter, the Föppl-von Kármán (FvK) number γ = YR 2 κ , which is the ratio of the stretching and bending energies [43, 44, [56] [57] [58] [59] . In terms of the parameters of our model, the FvK number becomes simply\n",
            " Another nice feature of the present coarse-grained model is that it only depends on very few parameters which have a clear and meaningful physical interpretation. In particular, the diameters σ h and σ p represent the effective size of an hexamer and a pentamer, respectively. They can be determined as the diameter of a sphere circumscribing the actual hexameric and pentameric capsomer of a real virus of interest (see figures 3(a) and (b)). The remaining parameters entering into the different interaction potential terms, can be determined for a specific virus either from experiments or atomistic simulations. More specifically, atomistic umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations can be used to the determine the potential of mean force (PMF) between two hexamers or pentamers [60] . Using the distance between the center of masses of two hexamers as reaction coordinate, it is possible to evaluate the atomistic PMF as a function of their separation. This can then be fitted to the Mie expression, equation (3), obtaining the values of m and n, controlling the range of the interaction and ij , representing the minimum of the potential. This procedure has been implemented, for instance, to obtain the effective interaction potential between two CcmK2 hexamers in studies of carboxysome assembly [60] . Alternatively, the effective binding energy between capsomers can be obtained from assembly or calorimetry experiments [61] or estimated by calculating the association energies in the atomistic equilibrium structure, considering the sum of energies due to desolvation, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions between all atoms of the interacting subunits [62] .\n",
            " The parameter ν describes the optimal angle of interaction between two capsomers. It can be approximated by the actual angle between hexamers in the native structure (see figure 3(c)) or even estimated for each T-number shell from a simple geometrical relation [53] cos(ν) = −σ/(2R), where R is the radius of the capsid. Alternatively, it could be evaluated from the PMF in a full-atom simulation of two capsomers in contact for different relative orientations. The orientation corresponding to the minimum of the PMF will directly determine the value of ν. These simulations will be also useful to evaluate the local bending rigidity α, accounting for the energy required to bend the contact between two capsomers out of the preferential angle of interaction. The same simulations can also be used to determine the parameter k t of the torsion potential, by getting the PMF of two hexamers in contact using the torsion angle as reaction coordinate.\n",
            " Hence, by following this protocol one could get an accurate coarse-grained interaction potential between capsomers. With it, one could provide a nearly quantitatively accurate description of nanoindentation experiments of a specific virus of interest. The VAFM thus represents a sort of multiscale approach to simulate the mechanical properties of viruses, where the precise values of the parameters of the effective interactions can be determined from all atom simulations involving just two capsomers, and the global response of the capsid can be simulated at larger length and time scales using a very simple and efficient coarse-grained model. However, instead of pursuing this route for a particular virus, our aim in this work is to perform a more physical study and to explore how the mechanical response and some of the peculiar features observed in AFM nanoindentation experiments depend on the global physical parameters and energetic contributions describing the effective interactions.\n",
            " To that end, we will focus on a specific T-number shell, choosing reasonable values of the parameters and working in reduced units (instead of real units) so that the results can be applied to a wide class of viruses. More specifically, we will study a generic T = 7 shell (representative, for instance, of bacteriophage λ, P22 or T7), fixing a reasonable value of the binding energy, namely hh = 20k B T , which is a characteristic value of the association energies between capsomers obtained from atomic structures in [62] . For this choice, the reduced temperature becomes T = 0.05. All our simulations have been performed with m = 12 and n = 6, i.e. the standard parameters of a Lennard-Jones potential, since those values have been found to reproduce efficiently the assembly of the smallest Caspar and Klug structures [53] . For a T = 7 shell, the appropriate preferred angle between capsomers can be approximated by ν = 1.796, corresponding to the lowest energy structure in [53] . We have set a value for the torsion constant of k t = 1.5, but its precise value does not affect the mechanical response of the shell significantly.\n",
            " The VAFM is a simulation that emulates the nanoindentation process of virus by an AFM, i.e. it simulates the lowering of a spherical tip attached to a microcantilever which exerts a force on a sample, in this case, an empty viral nanocage. The simulation setup is shown in figure 4 . In the simulations we have added a rigid surface at a position z = 0, representing the substrate; the tip of a cantilever at the top, modeled as a sphere which can only move in the z direction, and a preformed capsid between them mimicking the experimental situation. The capsomers, depicted by the red and green spheres in figure 4 , interact pairwise through the coarse-grained potential described earlier. They also interact with the tip and with the substrate.\n",
            " The interaction between capsomers and the sphere of radius R t representing the AFM tip (depicted in figure 4 by a blue sphere) is modeled by the following purely repulsive harmonic potential\n",
            " where k rep is an effective repulsive spring constant, r ic the distance between the center of the cantilever and capsomer i, and σ i is σ p or σ h for a pentamer or a hexamer, respectively.\n",
            " To mimic the deflection of the cantilever caused by the interaction with the capsid, its z-position is updated using the following overdamped Euler equation\n",
            " where dt = 10 −5 is the time step used in the simulations, F c = − i k rep (r ic − (R t + σ/2)) is the total force on the cantilever due to the interaction with all capsomers, k c is the spring constant of the cantilever, D c is its diffusion coefficient, and ξ is a Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance 1. Finally, the substrate (figure 4, black surface) is modelled as a flat rigid surface. To account for potential effects of adsorption with the substrate, as often occurs in experiments, a binding energy of adsorption E ads is considered. This adsorption contribution is described by the interaction potential\n",
            " where σ i /2 is the radius of capsomer i and |z| is the distance between capsomer i and the substrate. In the initial configuration, the empty capsid is placed slightly above the surface and the positions and orientations of all capsomers correspond to the optimal values for the parameters and T-number used. To prevent rotation and sliding in the simulations, the position of some capsomers is fixed, depending on the orientation of the virus. Specifically, for indentations along the 5-fold symmetry we have fixed four pentamers: the two pentamers located on the z-axis can only move in the z direction and another two pentamers having initially y = 0, cannot move in the y-direction. For indentations along the 3-fold, two pentamers have x, y fixed and can only move along z; and another two pentamers are fixed at x = 0.\n",
            " In all simulations some parameters have been fixed, unless stated otherwise: the radius of the tip was set to R t = 3σ and the spring constant of the cantilever to k c = 40 0 /σ 2 . For a typical capsomer size of σ ∼ 10 nm and binding interaction equation to estimate the diffusion coefficient of this typical capsomer size, we get a a characteristic time τ = σ 2 /D ∼ 2.3 μs. The strength of the tip-capsomer repulsion was set to k rep = 80 0 /σ 2 , but the specific value of this parameter is not relevant, since the same results were reproduced for k rep = 160 0 /σ 2 .\n",
            " As in experiments, the simulation procedure involves the progressive lowering of the tip. In our simulations, the z position of the cantilever is initially set to a value above the shell and it is lowered at steps of 0.005σ. We lower the tip typically after 10 6 steps, measuring the average force on the cantilever sampled every 100 steps. The simulation runs for a total of 5 × 10 8 steps corresponding to a total indentation of 2.5σ. For a typical capsomer size of σ ∼ 10 nm, the indentation speed in real units will correspond to 2 μm s −1 , which will be a relatively fast indentation. In some simulations, the retraction of the tip is also simulated, to check the reversibility, using the same number of steps and height increments.\n",
            " With the 'Virtual AFM' it is possible to study the mechanical properties of different capsid structures. Our high-level of coarse-graining makes this model particularly suitable to analyze the nanoindenation of viruses whose detailed atomic structure is not known or of large viruses. As an example, figure 5 shows a snapshot of a simulation and a typical nanoindentation curve obtained with our VAFM for two large viral shells: a T = 13 shell, resembling the external layer of infectious bursal disease virus, and a T = 25 shell mimicking the nanoindentation of adenovirus. To our knowledge, those large shells have not being simulated using full-atomistic or structure-based coarse-grained simulations, since the number of residues involved would make them computationally very expensive.\n",
            " For the sake of simplicity, in this work, we will focus on an empty T = 7 viral shell as a particular example. The T = 7 capsid is a chiral structure that can have two different chiralities: leavo and dextro [63] . In our simulations we have used a T = 7 leavo structure, since this chirality seems to be the most abundant for T = 7 viruses of known structure [64] . We have also performed simulations for a T = 7 dextro shell, finding no significant differences in the results. Figure 6 shows three repetitions of a typical nanoindentation curve obtained from simulations of a 5-fold oriented T = 7 capsid including also the retraction of the tip. As in experiments, from the force F versus z curves we calculate the indentation as δ = −z c − F/k c + z 0 , where z c is the position of the cantilever. The indentation curves are also shifted in z by a distance z 0 in such a way that the tip-sample contact starts at δ = 0.\n",
            " For small indentations, the F versus δ curves show a linear and reversible behavior corresponding to elastic response. At large indentations the linear regime ends up by an abrupt decline of the force, corresponding in this case to the sinking of the top pentamer, that gets inside the capsid, leaving a small hole behind. A second abrupt drop in the force is observed when the tip breaks the upper part of the capsid generating a large hole. This cracking of the capsid is not reversible, as shown by the different routes followed by the retraction curves of the tip. The final structure after retraction sometimes is partially healed as shown in the inset figure of a structure missing one pentamer with a small hole and pentamers and hexamers reorganized. Figure 7 shows similar nanoindentation curves obtained when a 'soft' virus, i.e. one with a relatively low bending stiffness, is indented along its 3-fold axis of symmetry. The indentation curves show an initial linear regime followed by an increase in the slope ended by an abrupt drop in the force which in this case is not associated to the breaking of the shell, but rather to its flattening on top of the substrate, as will be discussed in more detail later on. The critical force and indentation associated with the sudden drop of the curves change in different repetitions of the same simulation. This is indicative of the stochastic, temperature-activated nature of this phenomenon.\n",
            " It is worth emphasizing that the indentation curves obtained using our 'Virtual AFM' are remarkably and qualitatively nearly identical to the experimental curves measured with the real AFM, as illustrated in the comparison between figures 1(a) and (b).\n",
            " As mentioned before, one of the potential uses of the VAFM would be to focus on a specific virus of interest and try to reproduce quantitatively experimental nanoindentation curves by tuning properly the values of the effective interaction parameters. Rather than following this approach, we have opted in the present work to use the VAFM to analyze in global physical terms how the mechanical response of a viral capsid measured in a nanoindentation experiment depends on the physical characteristics of the interaction. In par ticular, we analyze the influence on the mechanical response of different parameters, such as the bending stiffness, related to the parameter α, the radius of the tip, the adsorption energy of the substrate E ads , and the geometry of the indentation. The results are briefly summarized in the following subsections. Figure 8 shows the influence of the bending rigidity on the indentation along the 5-fold orientation of a T = 7 shell with one type of capsomer. The bending rigidity κ of the shell is dictated by the parameter α through equation (11) . As α increases, the bending rigidity decreases and the capsid becomes softer, tolerating larger indentations. For α ∈ [0.1, 0.5] the shape of the shell is spherical and the effective spring constant, obtained from the slope of a linear fit for small indentations, decays as k cap ∼ √ κ ∼ 1/α, as predicted by thin-shell theory [17, 35] . The sudden drop in the force curves for α = 0.1 and α = 0.2 corresponds to a breaking event, associated with the opening of a hole in the upper part of the capsid. However, for α = 0.3 the capsid is very soft, and resists large indentations (of up to 75% of its radius), until its final collapse into a pancakelike shell. For α > 0.3, the shell becomes progressively more faceted. This faceting is noticeable by an increase in its 5-fold height, signalled in the figure by the shifting in the contact point towards negative values. For α > 0.6 the shell undergoes a buckling transition [43] , as indicated by the change in height. The several drops observed in the measured force are due to a progressive faceting or flattening of the shell on top of the substrate rather than to an actual breaking event (which is unlikely because the structure is very soft).\n",
            " An important conclusion of this study is that the effective spring constant measured by AFM is not only determined by the strength and range of the binding interactions (which in this case are kept constant) but also by the bending cost to drive the capsomers away from their preferred angle of interaction. Thus, the Young's modulus is not the only elastic constant determining the effective spring constant of a virus. This aspect, qualitatively captured by equation (2), is often overlooked in the interpretation of experiments.\n",
            " One recurrent question concerning nanoindentation experiments is the influence of the substrate on the measured mechanical properties of viruses. We have analyzed the influence of the adsorption strength with the substrate on the indentation curves for capsids of different bending rigidity. Figure 9 shows the results for a relatively rigid shell with α = 0.1. At small values of the adsorption energy, E ads < 1, the capsid keeps its nominal height and the slope of the indentation curves is insensitive to E ads . However the maximum value of the indentation before the first drop in the force occurs goes down as the adsorption gets stronger. The drop corresponds in this case to the flattening of the bottom part of the virus induced by the applied force. For 1 < E ads < 4, the bottom pentamer and the five surrounding hexamers are initially adsorbed on the substrate leading to a well-defined initial height of the capsid which is smaller than the nominal height (reflected in figure 9 by a shift of the contact point between the tip and the sample).\n",
            " At very large adsorptions, E ads > 4, the strong adsorption eventually flattens and breaks the bottom part of the shell, which stands on the substrate by an adsorbed ring of hexamers, exhibiting a well defined reduced height. As E ads further increases, the height of the supported dome gets down at discrete steps (see the dark green curve in figure 9 for E ads = 10), corresponding to different number of adsorbed capsomers at the adsorption rim. Remarkably, the strongly adsorbed shell which has a broken bottom still exhibits almost the same spring constant as the intact shell.\n",
            " For α = 0.3, corresponding to softer shells with smaller bending rigidity, there is a wide variability of adsorption heights, instead of the discrete set observed for α = 0.1. This behavior has been recently reported experimentally and used to estimate the bending rigidity of Brome mosaic virus [65] . If the adsorption energy is very weak, the indentation curve shows a smaller slope and an inflection or steps in the middle due to the progressive flattening of the bottom part or the lateral faces induced by the force. As E ads increases, the shell shows different apparent heights, corresponding to different levels of adsorption, but the same initial spring constant. For E ads > 4, the shell is strongly adsorbed on the substrate, leading to a partial reorganization of the capsomers and a higher spring constant. Remarkably, despite the strong adsorption, no breaking of the bottom part of the shell occurs even at E ads = 10.\n",
            " To summarize the effects of the substrate, the slope is nearly the same in all curves, showing that reasonable adsorption with the substrate has no significant influence on the stiffness measured in the AFM [65] . However, the apparent heights, breaking forces and critical indentations depend on the adsorption strength and typically get smaller as the adsorption gets larger.\n",
            " Another interesting aspect to explore is the potential influence of the tip radius on the nanoindentation curves. Figure 10 shows the curves obtained using different tip radius for nanoindentations along the 5-fold and 3-fold directions.\n",
            " Remarkably, for indentations along the 5-fold axis (see figure 10 (a)) the well defined contact of the tip with the top pentamer makes that all curves coincide having the same slope. The slope only changes for large indentations for R t > 5, when the tip radius is large enough to press on more than one capsomer at a time. Contrarily, for indentations along the 3-fold axis of symmetry (see figure 10 (b)), the tip is placed in the space between three hexamers, and the contact height depends on the tip size, as indicated by the shift of initial contact points. In addition, the slopes are different and increase continuously with the tip radius up to converging to a constant value for very large, essentially flat, tips. Therefore, the results suggest that the radius of the tip leads to changes in the measured height and spring constant whenever it permits the contact with a larger area of the capsid.\n",
            " One of the most representative characteristics of both experimental and simulated indentation curves are abrupt drops in the force, that occur after the initial linear regime. These force drops have been traditionally attributed to capsid breaking, see figure 1 (a). However, in the simulations we see that many different physical phenomena can happen with the same signature corresponding to a drop in the force. The advantage of the simulations is that one can correlate the observed drops in the force with snapshots obtained from the simulations. In that way, we have observed that sudden drops in the force correspond, very often in an indistinguishable way, to breaking, buckling, rotation and/or sliding. Rotation and sliding are the most common cause of sudden drops in the force when the capsid is not properly immobilized on the substrate. When rotation and sliding are prevented, one could still observe breaking, buckling, and reorganization of capsomers, see figure 11 . It is important to distinguish between breaking and buckling events. Breaking is defined as the disruption of the capsid involving rupture of intercapsomer bonds. This is typically an irreversible phenomenon that is associated with the presence of a crack or hole in the capsid (see figure 11 (a)), as can be observed also in AFM experiments. Breaking is important for the life cycle of virus, since it will expose the genome. In nanotechnological applications it is indispensable to prevent the unwanted breaking of the shell for nanoencapsulation. In a buckling process there is a collective change in the position of several capsomers, leading to a faceting of the structure, without cracks, see figure 11 (c). If the indentation stops just after a buckling event and the tip is retracted we could observe very often that this buckling is reversible.\n",
            " The goal of this section is to characterize a bit better these phenomena and how they depend on different factors such as the bending stiffness of the shell. This information is potentially useful to tune the mechanical resistance of a capsid for different applications or to promote its disruption.\n",
            " A good example of different drops in the force under indentation is plotted in figure 12 , corresponding to a relatively rigid T = 7 capsid indented along the 5-fold direction. This figure shows first a buckling process. The second drop corresponds to the collapse of the bottom pentamer, that adopts the same z-position as the hexamers around it and the third drop is when the structure actually breaks. In experimental force curves the force drops are identical to the ones observed in the simulations, but the mechanism involved in the drop is unknown in most cases. It is usual to interpret always a drop in the force as a breaking event. But with the help of our simulation one can see that this is not always correct, and that the mechanism depends on the elastic characteristic of the capsid. When the bending rigidity of the shell is large, the shell is more fragile, and breaking events are usually the most probable cause of force drops. Buckling appears normally for low values of bending stiffness, corresponding to soft shells that deform easily, preventing rupture.\n",
            " Many viruses, such as bacteriophage T7, change their shape from spherical to polyhedral during the maturation of their capsids [66] . This change in viral shape is present in the maturation of others viruses such as λ or HK97 [29, 67] and it is indispensable to become infective.\n",
            " The change in shape might alter the mechanical response of the shell and could bring some mechanical advantages [38] . Previous works on viruses like λ and HK97, which suffer a transition between spherical and polyhedral shapes during their maturation, show mechanical changes. In particular, λ mature virion is more resistant than its prohead [14, 29] or HK97 virion is stiffer than its prohead, but the prohead tolerates larger deformations [29] .\n",
            " In this section we compare the mechanical response of our model T = 7 shell in its spherical and polyhedral shapes. Using the 'Virtual AFM' it is possible to obtain qualitative information about the mechanical changes associated to a shape change, as the one occurring in viruses upon maturation.\n",
            " In our study, the change in shape was obtained by changing the parameter α related to the bending stiffness [53] . In particular, it was found in [53] that T = 7 structures with one type of subunit exhibit a transition between a spherical shape and a polyhedral shape at α ≈ 0.6. The structure become progressively more and more faceted as α is further increased. We have chosen the values of α = 0.1 to represent the spherical prohead and α = 1.0 for the mature capsid because for this value the structure is noticeable faceted, but stable enough to sustain AFM indentations.\n",
            " As an example, we will analyze the case of bacteriophage T7 with one type of morphological subunit. A value of the interaction between hexamers and pentamers of E hp = 1.4E hh was chosen to reproduce the relative strength of the hexamerhexamer and hexamer-pentamer contact energies reported from the atomic structure in [30, 68] . Figure 13 shows the force versus indentation curves obtained for the model 'prohead' (circles) and 'mature capsid' (triangles) along the 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry axes. In general the spherical shape, for all folds, is stiffer than the polyhedral shape, due to its higher bending rigidity.\n",
            " We have calculated the spring constants for both shapes and observed a change in their relative ordering. Specifically, we obtained k sp 3 = 55.6, k sp 2 = 48.2, k sp 5 = 34.2 ± 0.5 0 /σ 2 0 . Thus, the 3-fold is the stiffest and the 5-fold is the softest. In contrast, for the polyhedral shape we obtained k ico 2 = 11.6, k ico 3 = 9.9, k ico 5 = 5.8 ± 0.5 0 /σ 2 0 , and thus the softest orientation is the 5-fold, and the stiffer is the 2-fold, yielding an order of constants k 2 > k 3 > k 5 .\n",
            " The spring constants obtained in experiments are similar for the prohead and virion in all symmetry axes, contrarily to our simulations. This discrepancy is mainly due to the fact that the increase in α required to obtain the polyhedral shape also modifies significantly the global stiffness of the shell. Thus, in its present form, our model cannot capture realistically the complicated changes associated to viral maturation. However, the order of the spring constant for our polyhedral shell is the same as that found in nanoindentation experiments for the mature T7 capsid [30] . Remarkably, the anisotropic elasticity obtained from AFM indentation experiments of T7 viral capsids does not follow the anisotropy expected from continuum homogenous models [23] . Whereas the experimental results show the spring constant of T7 capsids for each icosahedral symmetry axis as k 5c < k 3c < k 2c , FEM simulations of the stiffness performed in thin shell continuum models establishes k 5 < k 2 < k 3 [30] . In addition, FE simulations of a thin or thick icosahedral shell with the same dimensions as T7 also predict an incorrect order of the spring constants. Remarkably, the results obtained with our VAFM reproduce the same order of the effective spring constants found in the experiments (i.e. k 5c < k 3c < k 2c ). This suggests that the distinct stiffnesses for the different orientations found in the T7 capsid are associated to the discrete nature of its structural components and to their particular arrangement in the final structure.\n",
            " In this article we have presented the implementation of a 'Virtual AFM', a BD simulation using a coarse-grained model for a viral capsid, designed to mimic the standard setup of AFM nanoindentation experiments. This 'Virtual AFM' is a very useful tool to investigate the mechanical properties of viruses, and how they change with the relevant physical parameters. With this tool it is also possible to interpret real experiments, providing a simple way to account for the influence of the discrete structure of the capsid, and obtaining very useful information about the physical ingredients involved in the mechanical response of viral capsids.\n",
            " Our 'Virtual AFM' has been already useful to interpret experiments performed on bacteriophage T7 [30] . The simulations explain the unusual anisotropic stiffness found in these experiments, and reproduce qualitatively the experimental results. We have also analyzed how the measured stiffness depends on different physical parameters, and on the shape of the virus. In particular, we have shown that the measured spring constant not only depends on the Young's modulus of the shell but also on the local bending rigidity between subunits. We have also analyzed the influence of the adsorption with the substrate on the elastic response of a virus. Our findings suggest that the effective spring constant of the virus is almost insensitive to the substrate, but the virus height, breaking forces and maximum indentations depend on the adsorption strength and the bending rigidity of the virus. The radius of the AFM tip has a minor influence on the measured slope, associated with changes in the contact area. We have also shown that sudden drops in the force are not always a signature of breaking of the shell. Adsorption, faceting and buckling can also lead to indistinguishable force drops, evidencing that caution has to be taken in the interpretation of experiments. Finally, we have found that viruses show an anisotropic elastic response where the relative magnitude of the spring constants not only depend on the triangulation number, but also on the shape of the shell. Although in this work we have focused on the T = 7 structure, the Virtual AFM can be a useful tool for many future studies of indentation, buckling and breaking of different T-number viruses.\n",

            "Body Text: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) caused by viruses represent a major cause of hospitalization and morbidity in young children and infants worldwide. Pathogens associated with this clinical condition include the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. 1 Although a constantly growing number of pathogens is being associated with ARTIs, a high percentage of infections still remain uncharacterized and their causative agents unknown.\n",
            " In 2005 Allander et al. described a previously uncharacterized virus in pools of human nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from children suffering from diseases of the respiratory tract. 2 Comprehensive sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed a close relation of the new virus with the bovine parvovirus (BPV) and the canine minute virus (CnMV), both members of the Bocavirus genus of the Parvoviridae family. It was therefore provisionally named human bocavirus (HBoV).\n",
            " Parvoviruses represent a large family of small, non-enveloped viruses characterized by linear single-stranded DNA-genomes and an exceptional structural simplicity. Besides HBoV two additional parvoviruses, parvovirus B19 (B19V) and PARV4 including its second genotype termed PARV5, are currently known or discussed to infect humans. [3] [4] [5] For almost three decades B19V has represented the only member of the virus family to cause illness in humans, e.g. the self-limiting childhood disease Erythema infectiosum. 6 Additionally, B19V infections during pregnancy are known to frequently result in intrauterine infections of the fetus, occasionally leading to miscarriage or Hydrops fetalis. 7 While the clinical relevance of PARV4 remains unclear up to date, evidence for an influence of HBoV infections in the manifestation of respiratory and gastric symptoms is accumulating.\n",
            " For detection of HBoV VP2-specific IgG and IgM, 100 ng of purified HBoV VP2 virus-like particles (VP2-VLP) were generated as previously described 8 and coated onto Nunc-Immuno TM MediSorp TM plates (Nunc GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) in coating buffer (0.2 M Na 2 CO 3 , 0.2 M NaHCO 3 , pH 9.5) overnight at 4 • C. The plates were subsequently washed six times with washing buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked with dilution buffer (PBS, 2% Tween 20, 3% FCS) for 1 h at 37 • C. After incubation with respective serum samples for 2 h at 37 • C, the plates were washed and rabbit anti-human IgG-or IgM-specific HRP-coupled secondary antibodies were added for 1 h at 37 • C (1:6000 and 1:1000 in dilution buffer, respectively; both Dako Deutschland GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Development was performed using the BD OptEIA TM Substrate (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n",
            " As an international IgG standard for HBoV is not yet available, serially diluted sera of a healthy adult male (age: 28 years) and of a boy (age: 22 months) both exhibiting strong HBoV-specific IgG-and IgM-responses, respectively, were introduced for internal reference and used for the calculation of HBoV-specific antibody titers in all performed experiments. Sera with background optical densities were considered negative and used for the determination of respective IgG/IgM cut-off values, which were additionally confirmed by Western blot analysis.\n",
            " All reports listed in the PubMed-database of the National Library of Medicine (Rockville Pike, MD, USA) until May 2008 have been considered and evaluated in this review.\n",
            " Up to date, no cell culture systems for the in vitro replication of HBoV have been described. Therefore, diagnosis of HBoV infection has so far mainly been based on the detection of viral genomes present in human respiratory, serum, stool, and urine samples using different PCR techniques employing numerous sets of primers specific for the viral genes NP1, 2,9-12 NS1 12-15 and VP1/2. 11, 12, [16] [17] [18] Recent reports describe the detection of HBoV-specific antibodies directed against the viral capsid proteins VP1 and/or VP2 in serum samples using ELISA, 19, 20 Western blot, 21 and immunofluorescence assays. 22 Up to date, no cross-reactions of HBoV-and B19V-specific humoral and/or cellular immune responses have been described.\n",
            " HBoV-DNA has been frequently detected worldwide in respiratory, 2,9-11,13-16,18,23-66 serum, 30, 43 fecal, 17, 30, 33, 35, 38, 67, 68 and urine samples 38 obtained from infants mainly around 2 years of age. The prevalence of HBoV-DNA has been described to vary considerably between 2.7-19% in children suffering from ARTIs and 0.8-9.1% in patients with gastroenteritis. 17, 25, 35, 43 However, since the majority of currently published studies have been performed retrospectively, these variations in viral prevalence may be explained by differences in the study populations and patient characteristics. In infected infants, viral loads have been described to range between < 500 to 10 10 and <10 3 to 5.9 × 10 5 genome copies in nasopharyngeal aspirates and fecal samples, respectively. 25, 37, 43, 52 In serum, we have detected viral loads of up to 1.2 × 10 6 /ml. 69 Only limited data is available on the prevalence of HBoV viremia in asymptomatic individuals, since most of the studies have focused on children with distinct clinical symptoms of infectious diseases. In a first study a total of 96 healthy controls were included for diagnostic analysis of HBoV, yet no viral DNA was observed in respiratory samples from these individuals. 16 Furthermore, we were unable to detect HBoV-DNA in sera collected from 298 healthy adult blood donors. However, a recent publication describes the detection of viral genomes in 5% of respiratory samples obtained from asymptomatic children. 24 While most studies have detected the virus during the winter season, 2,28,33,38,46,70 single reports describe increased numbers of viral infections in spring or summer. 9, 31, 40 No information is currently available on the routes of viral transmission. However, since HBoV can be frequently detected in respiratory and fecal samples, a transmission of the virus via aerosols or direct contact has to be presumed. Thereby, the contagiousness of virus-containing body secretions might be potentiated by the exceptional stability of parvoviral virions and might facilitate increased frequencies of nosocomial infections.\n",
            " Up to date, only a limited number of studies have been focused on the analysis of HBoV-specific adaptive immune responses in healthy individuals and infants suffering from ARTIs, mainly due to the initial lack of recombinant viral antigens and standardized diagnostic methodologies.\n",
            " In the first report published on HBoV seroprevalence Endo and co-workers describe ubiquitous IgG-responses against the viral capsid protein VP1 in up to 100% of children aged ≥2 years with respiratory infections. 22 The overall seroprevalence of HBoV-specific IgG in the Japanese population aged between 0 months and 41 years was 71.1%, while seronegative patients were observed most frequently in infants with 6-12 months of age.\n",
            " In a subsequent study the prevalence of HBoV-specific antibodies in Finnish infants suffering from ARTIs was assessed using Western blot. 21 In children determined positive for HBoV-DNA, IgGand IgM-antibodies against the viral VP2 protein were observed in 73% and 49% of analyzed samples, respectively. The mean age of these children was 2.1 years. The overall prevalence of HBoVspecific IgG and IgM in children without detectable viral genomes in nasopharyngeal samples was 35% and 13%, respectively. Antibodies against the aminoterminal domain of the viral VP1 protein, termed VP1-unique region, were detected rarely: only 7% (IgG) and 2% (IgM) of the patients showed positive results. In contrast to the data provided by Endo and colleagues and by our group (see below), the prevalence of HBoV-specific IgG was shown to decline from 52% in 1-2 year old infants to 29% in children aged over 5 years in the Finnish study. 21 Furthermore, maternal VP2-specific IgG were not observed in children <6 months of age despite a seemingly high seroprevalence of HBoV in adults. This finding may be due to the maturation of IgG-specificity in the time period of up to 6 months following an acute infection, during which antibodies against linear epitopes get replaced by those preferentially recognizing conformational antigen structures. This process has been well documented for B19V-specific humoral immune responses, 71 and therefore it may be assumed that similar changes in IgG affinity take place during HBoV infections.\n",
            " More recently, we and others have established ELISA assays based on the use of recombinant HBoV VP2-VLP for the detection of HBoV-specific antibodies in human serum samples. 19, 20 Herein, our group observed the prevalence of IgG 1 subclass antibodies against HBoV VP2-VLP to rise from 24% in children with 7-9 months of age to 98.3% adult blood donors (mean age: 42 years).\n",
            " In addition to humoral immune reactions the presence of HBoV-specific T-cells in healthy adults supports a high prevalence of HBoV-specific immunity in adults. Thereby, frequent interferon-gamma (IFN-) mediated CD4 + T helper cell reactions were observed against HBoV capsid proteins. 8 Similar data have been previously described for B19V-specific cellular immune responses. [72] [73] [74] [75] \n",
            " HBoV infections are frequently linked to high rates of coinfections with viral and bacterial pathogens of the respiratory and/or gastrointestinal system. Together with the fact that most of the studies have been performed retrospectively and longterm follow-up studies with detailed clinical characterization of symptomatic individuals are rare, it is currently difficult to clearly determine HBoV as sole infectious agent of human illnesses.\n",
            " Up to date, HBoV infections have been detected in young children around the age of 2 years with acute diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract, 2, [9] [10] [11] 13, 14, 16, 18, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] frequently in combination with interstitial lung infiltrates and abnormal radiologic findings. 2, 28, 37, 45, 55 In HBoV positive individuals, we detected both virus-specific IgG and IgM in 42% of studied sera, whereas no IgM were observed in samples obtained from children without detectable amounts of HBoV genomes in blood.\n",
            " Symptoms and disease manifestations observed in HBoV infected children include pneumonia, bronchiolitis, wheezing, respiratory distress, hypoxia, fever, rhinitis, laryngeal croup and, more rarely, conjunctivitis or rashes. In adults, acute HBoV infections leading to ARTIs seem to be rare and have been currently detected mainly in immunocompromised 13, 49, 51, 76 and only in single immunocompetent individuals. 13, 16 Recently, the presence of elevated viral loads in nasopharyngeal aspirates (>10 4 genome copies/ml) has been suggested to correlate with the severity of respiratory symptoms during HBoV infection, whereas low viral loads (<10 4 genome copies/ml) may represent viral persistence. 43 These data are in contrast to those published by Kleines et al. who could not find a relation between the viral load and the severity of HBoV associated illness, 37 indicating that further work is necessary to study the influence of the viral load on respiratory disease manifestation. However, infections with the related parvovirus B19 often result in a prolonged replication of the virus in infected individuals 5 and therefore mechanisms of persistence may also apply for HBoV.\n",
            " Individuals found positive for HBoV-DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates are frequently found to be co-infected with a multitude of additional viral and/or bacterial respiratory pathogens. Thereby, high rates of co-infections reaching up to 91% have been observed. 26 Commonly detected additional pathogens include RSV, human adenovirus, rhinovirus, and Streptococcus sp. Despite these high rates of co-infection, HBoV viremia has been frequently described to be significantly more prevalent in infants suffering from ARTIs than in age-matched asymptomatic control groups, 24, 26, 28, 43, 51 and therefore a role of HBoV in the development of human respiratory diseases is to be presumed. This finding is supported by our data, which show a significantly higher prevalence of HBoV infections in young children with lower respiratory tract infections (14.6%, 7/48) as compared to a control group of age-matched individuals hospitalized due to non-infectious conditions such as bone fractures or planned surgeries (5.0%, 3/60).\n",
            " In addition to respiratory symptoms, HBoV is currently discussed to be associated with gastroenteritic symptoms. Similar features are known from veterinary infections with the closely related BPV and CnMV, which are known to induce gastric illness in their respective hosts. 77, 78 First reports have described the prevalence of HBoV genomes to range between 0.8% and 9.1% in fecal samples obtained from children suffering from acute gastroenteritis, often in combination with ARTIs. 17, 28, 31, 33, 35, 53, 63, 67 In a recent prospective study we detected HBoV-DNA in 7.8% (5/64) fecal samples obtained from young children exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms, e.g. diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. An additional child tested positive for HBoV was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease.\n",
            " As co-infections with intestinal pathogens, e.g. human rotaand noroviruses, enteropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli or Salmonella sp., have been frequently observed in up to 77.6% of HBoV positive individuals, an association of HBoV with gastroenteritis remains unclear. 68 Since in many cases HBoV-DNA has been detected concurrently in both stool samples and nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from young children with ARTIs, 11 the presence of HBoV in fecal samples might represent natural viral shedding during an acute HBoV infection and not play an active role in the pathogenesis of gastric disease.\n",
            " Although HBoV was detected only three years ago, both epidemiological and clinical data establishing the virus as the second member of the Parvoviridae pathogenic to humans are accumulating. Based on current reports it seems most likely that HBoV may be associated with respiratory infections in young children and infants, while a further connection between HBoV and gastrointestinal symptoms has been suggested. However, as acute HBoV infections are often accompanied by infections with additional pathogens of both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, a final establishment of HBoV as the causative agent of infectious disease in humans needs to be confirmed by additional prospective studies. The methodological heterogeneity used for the diagnosis of HBoV infection raises questions about the specificity and comparability of many published studies, highlighting the urgent need of internationally standardized diagnostic guidelines and reference samples for the detection of HBoV genomes and virus-specific immune responses in human samples. As serological diagnostics of HBoV infection will become more important in the future, standardized viral DNA and antibody specimen should be provided as a basis to establish comparable test systems.\n",
            " Nevertheless, first data obtained from healthy control individuals and children with symptoms of non-infectious disease indicate distinctly lower rates of HBoV infections in comparison to patients suffering from ARTIs. Whether HBoV might require the presence of helper-viruses to establish human illness or may even act as the provider of such co-factors for other respiratory viruses, remains to be assessed in further studies.\n",

            "Body Text: Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multisubunit self-assemblycompetent protein structures with identical or highly related overall structure to their corresponding native viruses [1] . The term ''VLP'' has been used to describe a number of biological objects, such as uncharacterized structures with viral morphology that are found in biological samples, empty structures of viral origin that are not composed of nucleic acids, infectious viruses with chemically or genetically introduced structure modifications and noninfectious, self-assembled gene products resulting from the cloning and expression of viral structural genes in heterologous host systems. A cumulative search for the term ''virus-like,'' which is the most accepted name for these particles, in Google Scholar yielded 15,700 publication records through 1995, approximately 42,000 through 2005, and at least 102,000 publications through the middle of 2012. These data demonstrate the continuously increasing interest of scientists and technologists in different aspects of VLP-based technologies.\n",
            " The interest in new VLPs was largely inspired by the successful development and introduction of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen [2] and the human papilloma virus (HPV) capsid protein L1 [3] as commercial vaccines against hepatitis B and HPV-induced cervical cancer, respectively. Recently, several VLP-based vaccine candidates have entered different stages of clinical investigations with the aim to develop VLP-based vaccines for medical and veterinary purposes in the near future [4, 5] .\n",
            " The results of numerous studies suggest the high-immune response-stimulating activity of VLPs and demonstrate the B cell activation and high-titer antibody production that is triggered by the surface-displayed, structured and densely repeated amino acid (AA) motifs of the VLPs [6, 7] . In addition, the nanometer-sized VLPs can be taken up by antigen-presenting cells and degraded, which ultimately leads to T cell activation [8] . Moreover, due to their symmetric and highly repetitive AA structures, VLPs are capable of inducing strong humoral and cellular immune responses even in the absence of frequently used adjuvants [9] .\n",
            " VLPs have great potential for a number of applications in addition to vaccines. The treatment of many hereditary and acquired genetic disorders by different gene therapy tools is one of the most important challenges that are being addressed through the progress of nanotechnology. Comparisons of different nanocontainers suggest that icosahedral, filamentous, and lipid-enveloped virus-like vectors are the most promising gene carriers [10] . The current success of gene therapy is largely based on viral vectors and synthetic liposomes, although both have a number of limitations, such as restricted packaging capacity, production difficulties, and undesirable immunological properties. However, due to their construction flexibility, VLPs can be engineered to overcome these disadvantages, which include the use of chemical modifications to reduce unwanted immunological responses after repeated use [11] .\n",
            " In addition to the potential applications of VLPs as vaccines and gene therapy tools, particular interest has recently been paid to the development of new nanomaterials that are composed of different viruses and VLPs. This new area of biotechnology, which is called bionanotechnology, represents a broad multidisciplinary approach that employs concepts and methodologies from biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering [12] . As new nanomaterials, viruses and VLPs possess several advantages over the products that are produced by chemical synthesis, including their size, which ranges from 10 to 2000 nm, the availability of high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) models of their structure, their construction flexibility through chemical and molecular biological techniques, their high-production yields in natural and/or heterologous hosts, and the structural uniformity of each type of virus or VLP [13] .\n",
            " Narrowly, VLPs can also be defined as replicationincompetent macromolecular protein assemblies that consist of one or several structural proteins of different viruses and can be obtained from recombinant organisms via the expression of the corresponding cloned genes [14] . This review summarizes the publicly available data on VLPs from recombinant sources and discusses the main principles and methods that are used to construct and characterize these macromolecular assemblies. In some cases, examples from experiments that use native viral structural proteins as a source of VLPs are included to demonstrate the remarkable ideas and techniques that are used to obtain and characterize VLPs. Information on replication-competent VLPs and synthetic nanoparticles with virus-like properties can be found in other review articles [1, 15, 16] .\n",
            " Since the beginning of the 1980s, over 100 VLPs that originated from microbial, plant, insect, and mammalian viruses have been constructed and characterized. The aim of these studies was to use these particles for a variety of purposes, from basic virus assembly and structure studies to the production of commercial human and animal vaccines. Examples of VLPs from 35 different virus families, which are grouped according to the structure of their encapsidated nucleic acids, are summarized in Tables 1, 2 \n",
            " Historically, the first recombinant VLPs were obtained from synthesized and cloned coat protein (CP) genes from the HBV core antigen (HBcAg) [17] , the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) [18] , and the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) [19] . The first visualization of recombinant VLPs using electron microscopy was published in 1982, which demonstrated that the HBcAg VLPs were indistinguishable from the core shells that were isolated from an HBVinfected liver [20] .\n",
            " These first examples established several important ground rules for the construction of recombinant VLPs: (i) the construction of recombinant VLPs is largely based on several years (or even tens of years) of basic research on the corresponding virus; (ii) the necessary coding nucleic acids for the carrier coat protein(s) and for foreign functional peptides can be obtained synthetically from the aligned oligonucleotides; (iii) the foreign peptides can be inserted or added to the virus-based carrier molecule without influencing the self-assembly; (iv) VLPs can be obtained from heterologous hosts; and (v) newly constructed recombinant VLPs have significant advantages over native viruses, such as their availability in nearly unlimited amounts and similar or even better functional properties.\n",
            " The first stage of VLP construction is the cloning of the necessary structural genes. Clinical or veterinary specimens, as well as some environmental samples, such as infected plant or microorganism cells, typically serve as the source of these genes. Taking into account the fact that over 1,500,000 nucleotide sequence records can be found after a search of the Entrez site (The Life Science Search [25] Engine, NCBI) using the keyword ''virus,'' the sequence of the viral structural protein of interest can likely be found in the databases. In most cases, this sequence is sufficient to use oligonucleotides for the gene synthesis in the absence of infected material. It should be noted that the gene synthesis permits the inclusion of typical AA codons for the heterologous host in the target gene, which enhances the expression level of the target protein. Alternatively, at least in the case of E. coli, the usage of special host strains that synthesize rare AA codon-recognizing tRNAs can stimulate the efficient synthesis of the VLPs from their original sequence [21] . Typically, all known VLPs are derived from viruses that are well characterized, at least at the level of full-length nucleotide sequence and genome organization. Due to the vast amount of information that is available on different VLPs, it is not possible to analyze the details of the cloning of the viral structural genes in each case. Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 contain the list of structural genes for each virus family, the expressed genes that are necessary for the construction of the respective VLPs and examples with citations.\n",
            " One of the crucial factors in the construction of new VLPs is the choice of expression system. The analysis of the published reports on the successful construction of 174 VLP (Supplemental Tables 1-4) indicates that bacterial systems are used in 28 % of the cases, particularly for the production of bacterial and plant VLPs. The yeast (20 %) and insect systems (28 %) are more universal, and these expression hosts have been successfully used for the construction of VLPs from different sources. Plant (9 %) and mammalian hosts (15 %) are typically used to insure the production of VLPs with specific properties.\n",
            " Bacterial systems are mostly based on well-characterized commercial Escherichia coli strains and expression vectors. Despite their disadvantages, such as their inability to produce recombinant proteins with post-translational modifications, their inability to generate the proper disulfide bonds, the protein solubility problems, and the presence of endotoxins in the preparations of recombinant proteins. E. coli systems are a generally accepted technology that satisfies many research and industrial requirements and have been widely used for VLP production. A successful VLP production using E. coli is likely achievable in cases in which the target VLPs contain only one coat protein (CP; see Tables 1, 3, 4) that is soluble in the cells after cultivation. However, recombinant proteins, [22] and the CCMV [23] and CMV [24] plant viruses, viral CPs can also be efficiently produced in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies, purified under denaturing conditions, refolded, and self-assembled. Moreover, the self-assembly of VLPs in E. coli cells can be initiated by the simultaneous coexpression of a specific RNA structure, e.g., origin of assembly, with the CP gene [25] .\n",
            " However, a simple change in the cultivation conditions can solve the problem of inclusion bodies. Low-temperature cultivations, which are rather atypical for E. coli, may stimulate the formation of soluble VLPs, as shown in the case of the densovirus IHHNV [26] and the potyvirus PVY [27] . In addition, several factors, such as the resistance markers of the expression plasmids and the composition of the cultivation medium, can influence the assembly of VLPs, as demonstrated with the bacteriophage Qb VLPs [28] .\n",
            " E. coli cells have also been used for the complicated production of VLPs that require more than one type of structural protein for their formation. After the cloning and expression in E. coli of the avibirnavirus IBDV VP2-, VP4-, and VP3-containing polyprotein gene (Table 3) , the polyprotein was cotranslationally autoprocessed by protease VP4 activity, which enables the formation of immunologically active VLPs in bacterial cells [29] . However, as shown with the plant virus MRFV, the inclusion of the corresponding protease gene in the [30] . Another approach that can be used to achieve higher expression levels and solubility involves the usage of different fusion protein systems. The papillomavirus HPV L1 protein was obtained from recombinant E. coli cells in the form of a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, and the VLP assembly of the L1 protein was completed after the GST section was removed with thrombin. The quality of the resulting particles was sufficient to obtain L1 crystals for subsequent X-ray crystallographic analysis, which resulted in the construction of a 3D model of T = 1 icosahedral HPV L1 particles [31] . This fusion protein strategy has also been successfully exploited with the polyomavirus MuPyV [21, 32] and the picornavirus FMDV [33] VLPs. When the N-terminal part of the CP is located on the VLP surface, the N-terminally added short peptides, such as His-tag or small protein epitopes, do not influence the particle formation and can be directly introduced into the VLP structure without proteolytic cleavage and reassembly in vitro [27, 34] .\n",
            " Other prokaryotic organisms can also be used for VLP production. For example, Lactobacillus has been used for the production of the HPV L1 protein to generate edible vaccine candidates [35] , and Pseudomonas was used to improve the low solubility of the CP of CCMV [36] .\n",
            " Since the first successful experiments with HBV surface protein, which led to the production of commercial prophylactic vaccines against hepatitis B and the use of HPV L1 VLPs as a vaccine against cervical cancer, different yeast systems have been used for the construction of numerous VLPs, including the expression of viral structural genes of bacterial [37] [38] [39] , yeast [40, 41] , plant [42, 43] , and mammalian [18, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] origin (see also Supplemental Tables). Yeast expression systems, especially those that are based on Pichia and Hansenula strains, are more complicated than E. coli expression systems from the point of view of construction because yeast shuttle-vectors have to first be prepared in bacteria and then introduced into the yeast cells as plasmid vectors or selected to obtain stable yeast recombinants with a genome-integrated transgene.\n",
            " Comparative studies of the yeast expression systems revealed the efficiency of Pichia in the production of RNA bacteriophage VLPs. However, this production results in approximately 30 % of the yield that is obtained in E. coli, as was observed with the Qb VLPs [38] . A yeast system can also be used for the packaging of functional heterologous mRNA in bacteriophage MS2 VLPs if the simultaneous synthesis of the CP and the mRNA of the model protein is accomplished from the same expression vector. In this case, the design of the expression cassette requires the presence of special packaging RNA sequence that is found in the native MS2 genome [37] . However, these packaging signals are not always necessary for the formation of VLPs in yeast cells. The Saccharomyces expression system produces soluble CCMV VLPs that contain mostly host-derived RNA [43] , which is contrary to the E. coli-based expression system, in which the CPs form inclusion bodies. Another advantage of yeast systems is the possibility of introducing post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation or phosphorylation, to the VLP structure, as shown with the hepatitis B VLPs [44, 47] . Similar to the VLPs from recombinant bacteria, successful multigene expression systems have also been constructed in yeasts. The expression of three rotavirus structural genes (Table 3) from a single plasmid vector lead to the formation of triplelayered VLPs in S. cerevisiae cells [48] . However, in the case of enveloped viruses, such as HIV-2, S. cerevisiae cells do not support the multimerization of the Gag protein into VLPs and particle budding, which suggests that yeast does not contain the necessary host factors [49] . It is important to note that VLP formation does not always take place during the cultivation process of the yeast cells. Experiments with HBsAg from Pichia suggest that the selfassembly of the VLPs should be completed during the purification of the target product [50] .\n",
            " Insect cell-based expression systems are widely used for VLP production on the laboratory or industrial scale due to a number of advantages, such as the fast growth rates in animal product-free media, the capacity for large-scale cultivations, and the ability of post-translationally modifying the recombinant proteins similarly to mammalian cells [51] . The insect cell line derived from Trichoplusia ni is used for the production of the commercial HPV L1-VLP vaccine. In addition, at least 7 additional VLPs that are isolated from recombinant insect cells are at different stages of development as vaccine candidates [52] .\n",
            " For the expression of foreign viral protein genes in insect cells, the construction of vectors based on the modified baculoviruses is necessary. To obtain VLPs that contain more than one structural protein, insect cell lines are infected with multiple different monocistronic baculoviruses (coinfection) or with a single polycistronic baculovirus (coexpression). The coinfection strategy is the more accepted approach because it allows the manipulation of the relative expression levels of the corresponding structural proteins [53] . Moreover, this strategy allows the identification of the proteins that are necessary for VLP formation. Using a coinfection methodology, 6 different proteins have been shown to be simultaneously expressed and self-assembled into VLPs within the same cell, as demonstrated with the herpesvirus HSV [54] . The coexpression strategy was also shown to be effective in the construction of some VLPs, including those derived from influenza, using a tricistronic baculovirus with a triplicated polyhedron promoter [55] or even a quadrupole baculovirus with three polyhedrin and one p10 promoter [56] .\n",
            " The construction of VLPs from viruses with a polyprotein genome organization can be accomplished through the cloning of the whole polyprotein gene into the baculovirus vector. The polyprotein strategy has been successfully used in the case of the alphavirus SAV. The concerted action of the alphavirus protease from the polyprotein and the host-derived proteases at atypically low-cell culture cultivation temperatures are crucial factors for the formation and maturation of the VLP [57] . Similar results using the polyprotein cleavage approach were obtained with the plant virus CPMV [58] . As demonstrated in experiments with the entorovirus-71 VLPs, the polyprotein strategy can be more efficient in terms of VLP yields than the coinfection method [59] .\n",
            " Interestingly, baculovirus-based vectors can also be used with the whole insect larvae, including silkworm larvae [51] , as a cheaper alternative to produce VLPs [60] . The most recent baculovirus-silkworm multigene expression system insures the simultaneous expression of six different transgenes from a single recombinant baculovirus [61] .\n",
            " Initially, the attempts to generate VLPs in whole transgenic or natural plants with different transient expression vectors were tightly bound to the idea of edible vaccines. However, modern medical concepts require precisely formulated vaccine products and supervised administration to insure reproducible effects, which has made injectable vaccines more acceptable [62] . Despite the revision of the concept, plant systems remain a cost-effective and scalable alternative for the production of different medicinal proteins, including vaccines [63] . Some recent developments, such as the Norwalk VLPs that were manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions for subsequent clinical trials [64] and the results of the first human trials of edible vaccines [65] , continue to support the idea that VLPs from plant sources can be used as vaccines and suggest the necessity for further research in this area.\n",
            " The principles for the construction of VLPs in different plant expression systems, the successful production of VLPs in plants and the self-assembly of numerous viral structural proteins in plant hosts are extensively discussed in several review articles [63, 66, 67] . As an example, one of the most effective plant expression systems is based on the Agrobacterium-mediated transfer of a tobamovirusderived expression vector in whole plant cells, which resulted in yields of up to 3 g of recombinant VLPs per kg of leaf biomass [68] .\n",
            " It should be mentioned that plant hosts that are infected with native viruses can serve as a source of assemblycompetent viral structural proteins for the construction of new nanomaterials [69] .\n",
            " For over two decades, the use of mammalian cell cultures as a source of commercial therapeutic proteins has been developed [70] . Taking advantage of the product authenticity and the correct glycosylation pattern that are obtained with this system, more than half of all of the recombinant proteins in the pharmaceutical industry are produced in different mammalian cell lines [71] . Despite the complexity in the construction and practical applications, mammalian cell line systems are widely used for VLP production both in basic experiments and on the industrial scale with the aim to construct vaccine candidates and gene therapy agents. Different mammalian cells are especially efficient hosts for the construction of complex enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses. If a stable mammalian cell line expressing four influenza structural proteins is constructed, it is possible to create hybrid VLPs that contain matrix proteins from one influenza type (H3N2) and surface glycoproteins from another type (H5N1) [72] . This system would allow the generation of correctly glycosylated VLPs, which are similar in size to the native viruses, with encapsidated host cellular proteins and high-immunological activity. The most complicated system that has been developed to obtain VLPs was shown with influenza viruses. A cell line that was infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vector that expresses the T7 polymerase and transfected with bacterial plasmids containing the cDNAs of all ten influenza virus proteins was able to produce VLPs. Moreover, the model protein mRNA after cDNA transcription was rescued into the influenza VLPs [73] .\n",
            " The polyprotein strategy, which was described above, can also be used in mammalian cells. The polyprotein cDNA that encodes all of the structural proteins of the alphavirus CHIKV was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector, which was then introduced into a human cell line; the resultant cells produced CHIKV VLPs, as demonstrated through immunological and electron microscopy analyses [74] . Interestingly, these experiments demonstrated that the CHIKV VLPs are able to elicit stronger antibody responses than the corresponding DNA vaccines [74] .\n",
            " Crude cell extracts have been used as a tool for protein synthesis for over 50 years. In the past, cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) was mostly used in basic studies of the transcription and translation mechanisms, as well as for the rapid evaluation of different expression systems. In recent years, the development of CFPS has reached the stage of an independent expression system with potential industrial significance. CFPS systems based on E. coli, wheat germs, insect cells, and rabbit reticulocytes are now commercially available. The most popular is the E. coliderived CFPS due to the simple preparation of the extract and the comparably high yields of the desired proteins [75] . Recently, the synthesis of the RNA bacteriophage MS2-, Qb-, and HBV core-derived VLPs has been demonstrated using E. coli-based CFPS technology. In the case of the Qb VLPs, the CFPS allows the incorporation of the A2 protein, which is toxic for living cells [76] , whereas the production of the HBcAg, MS2 and Qb VLPs in the chosen cell-free system provides considerable stabilization of the particles through the introduction of disulfide bonds [77] . It is notable that the yield of the VLPs is almost 1 mg/ml and the efficiency of the VLP assembly exceeds 80 % in the case of HBcAg and Qb. These proof of concept experiments using well-established VLP models suggest that CFPS can also be used with more complicated cases, especially when the expression of the viral structural protein genes is toxic for living cells or if the conditions for the traditional systems do not allow the production of VLPs with the desired properties, e.g., when the incorporation of unnatural amino acids is necessary [78] .\n",
            " To insure that the constructed and synthesized VLPs remain intact for the intended downstream applications, the selection of the correct purification scheme is of the utmost importance. The VLP purification and characterization is largely based on experience that has been obtained in experiments with different viruses. Therefore, the initial conditions for the development of a purification protocol for a newly constructed and uncharacterized VLP can be based on those used with the corresponding native virus. In this section, the most important methods that are currently used in VLP purification, identification, and characterization will be reviewed.\n",
            " Because VLPs have been industrial products for over two decades, the general principles of VLP purification are well known and include the following steps: (i) the lysis of the cell to transfer the synthesized VLPs to the solution; (ii) the clarification process to insure the removal of cell debris and other large aggregates; (iii) the concentration step; and (iv) the polishing step to remove the residual host or target product-derived impurities [79] .\n",
            " The cell lysis is a very important step in VLP purification. However, because many mammalian and insect cell systems insure the secretion of the VLPs into the culture supernatants, the cell lysis step is not always necessary [52] . The VLPs produced in non-secreting systems require the use of a suitable approach to prepare the cell-free extract. For example, the simple treatment of eukaryotic cells with detergent-containing solutions is sufficient. In contrast, bacterial, yeast, and plant cells require strong mechanical treatment, such as various mills or French presses, ultrasonication, grinding with abrasives (e.g., aluminum oxide), repeated freezing/thawing cycles, and enzymatic treatments [80, 81] . For the purification of uncharacterized VLPs with unknown stability properties, different cell lysis protocols and extraction buffer compositions are tested to identify the optimal method that preserves the integrity of particles.\n",
            " To protect the VLPs from oxidation and host proteases during the purification process, the extraction buffers are often supplemented with reducing and chelating agents and protease inhibitors. In addition, nucleases are sometimes added at this stage to reduce the amount of host nucleic acids in the extracts. After clarification by low-speed centrifugation or ultrafiltration, the VLP-containing solutions have to be further concentrated and purified. A number of viruses and VLPs are stable enough to withstand precipitation with ammonium sulfate and/or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The precipitation significantly decreases the volume of the extract and the amount of host-derived impurities, which ultimately results in a reduced number of subsequent centrifugal and chromatography purification steps. In laboratory-scale purifications, further VLP purification by ultracentrifugation in CsCl or sucrose gradients is often sufficient to obtain suitable preparations for subsequent applications, especially when successive rounds of low-and high-speed centrifugations are applied. In industrial-scale processes, the use of ultracentrifugation has some restrictions due to the risk of VLP aggregation, the lack of scalability, and the enhancement of labor intensity [52] . Thus, instead of using ultracentrifugation, the necessary purity of VLPs is often achieved through special chromatographic processes. Depending on the properties of the VLP, different size-exclusion, ion exchange, and affinity columns are used in the purification process. However, additional steps, such as the treatment of the VLP solution with diatomic earth before the column chromatography, may be necessary to achieve the desired vaccine-grade purity level, as demonstrated with the production of HBsAg in Pichia [82] .\n",
            " The purification schemes not only include the removal of host or target product-derived impurities from VLPs. In special cases, to improve the functional properties of the target VLPs, a disassembly/reassembly stage is necessary. For example, reassembled human papilloma VLPs exhibit enhanced immunoreactivity and stability properties [83] .\n",
            " It is necessary to emphasize the methods that allow the identification of the VLP during the initial stages of construction. Different VLP properties can be useful for early detection and screening, and the methods partially overlap with those used in the purification. The application of PEG or ammonium sulfate, which have the ability to bind water molecules, until the solubility level of the VLP is exceeded can be used to precipitate high-molecular VLPs and leave the low-molecular impurities in the extract solution [84] . The purity of the precipitate is usually sufficient for simple downstream analysis to identify the VLP structural proteins by SDS/PAGE, agarose gel retardation tests of proteinnucleic acid complexes, which are typically used for VLPs [36, 85] , and sucrose gradient and size-exclusion chromatography for demonstrations of the high-molecular state of the VLPs [86] . Alternatively, if the precipitation conditions can disassemble the particles, the VLP-containing extracts can be directly concentrated by ultracentrifugation. If mono-or polyclonal antibodies against corresponding native virus or VLPs are available, additional proofs of the VLP formation can be obtained using ELISA, Western blots [87] , and immune diffusion tests as Ouchterlony's double radial immune diffusion in agarose [38] . An electron microscopy analysis is necessary as a final visual proof of the new synthesized VLPs because above-mentioned indirect tests may identify large, unstructured protein aggregates as VLPs.\n",
            " After purification, the different properties of the target VLPs have to be tested to demonstrate their accordance with the indented downstream applications. A valuable tool in the analysis of the VLP composition is mass spectrometry, which allows the measurement of the molecular mass of the assembled proteins. This technique has been used to identify proteolytically degraded [27] or post-translationally modified [44] proteins in the VLP structure. In the analysis of the glycosylation pattern of mammalian VLPs, the lectin-based glycan differentiation assay is a useful and rapid method for the identification of structural protein modifications [88] . The structural integrity of the VLPs can also be demonstrated by trypsin treatments in the presence or absence of detergents that are capable of dissociating the VLP-forming subunits [88] .\n",
            " Different VLP physical parameters are significant factors in the development of new identification methods and applications. The VLP concentration measurements can be complicated due to the protein/nucleic acid content of the particles. Nevertheless, simple but accurate concentration measurements based on UV spectra are available for the plant virus BMV and HBcAg VLPs; these are also applicable for other viruses and VLPs [89] . In addition, isoelectric point measurements by capillary isoelectric focusing have been found to be useful in the differentiation of the VLPs from different norovirus genogroups [90] .\n",
            " In complicated cases, immune and electron cryomicroscopy images can provide the necessary proof of the correctness of the constructed VLPs. Immunoelectron microscopy using colloidal gold that is conjugated to the antibodies has been widely used in VLP research and has been found to be necessary for the visualization and localization of antigens on the VLP surface. Electron cryomicroscopy provides images with comparably high resolution and has been used in a number of cases, including bluetongue [91] , HIV-1 [92] , HCV [93] , CHIKV [94] , and other VLPs. This method is also useful for the visualization of the displayed foreign peptides on the VLP surface [95] . More detailed information on electron microscopy and additional examples can be found in other review articles [96, 97] . Crystallization and subsequent X-ray structure analysis is usually applied for further resolution characterization of the VLP properties. VLPs are also used in cases in which the corresponding native viruses are not available in preparative amounts and in stepwise virus assembly studies [98] [99] [100] [101] .\n",
            " Because VLPs are mostly produced for different downstream applications, the stability of the recombinant particles is one of the most significant issues. Another important reason to perform stability experiments is the necessary determination of the conditions that support the disassembly of the particles for subsequent reassembly and packaging of the foreign agents, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and low-molecular mass compounds. To obtain data on their stability, the purified VLPs are incubated in different buffer solutions and/or at elevated temperatures. One of the most popular methods that demonstrates the influence of the incubation conditions on the VLP structure is the above-mentioned native agarose gel analysis, which was used with the plant virus CCMV and the RNA bacteriophages Cb5, MS2, and PRR1 [36, 98, 99] . However, this method is only applicable when the VLPs contain nucleic acids and when the dimensions of the VLP are compatible with agarose gel analysis. For filamentous or empty VLPs, other methods can be appropriate, such as various spectroscopic techniques, which were used with Norwalk VLPs [102] , and the detection of the appearance of lowmolecular structures through the separation of the samples by ultracentrifugation [27] . In the case of norovirus, the mechanical stability of the corresponding VLPs was tested by atomic force microscopy [103] . For high-throughput analyses, the structural changes in the VLPs at elevated temperatures are monitored in the presence of Sypro-Orange dye using a real-time PCR system and a DNA melting point determination program [27] . In some cases, the results of the stability studies should be corrected by electron microscopy visualizations, as was necessary for the hybrid rod-like VLPs of the bacteriophages GA and fr [104] .\n",
            " If the conventional expression system does not insure the production of oxidized VLPs, the stability of the VLPs can be considerably enhanced through the introduction of disulfide bridges to crosslink the individual structural proteins with hydrogen peroxide in the cell-free system. As a result, disulfide bridges-containing Qb VLPs can withstand temperatures of up to 75°C, whereas reduced VLPs are only stable at a temperature of approximately 45°C [77] . Simple additives can also enhance the VLP stability. From vaccine formulation studies, it is known that the addition of additives, such as polysorbate, sorbitol, and disaccharide trehalose, effectively prevents VLP aggregation [105, 106] .\n",
            " Viral structural proteins are typical nucleic acid-binding proteins. Numerous studies demonstrate the ability of recombinant VLPs to bind and encapsidate nucleic acids that are present in the host cells, such as the mRNA of the transgene, ribosomal and/or transport RNAs [88, [107] [108] [109] . In some cases, the mRNA of the cloned gene is not found in the VLPs [30] . DNA microarray experiments suggest that CCMV VLPs, along with its own mRNA, are capable of encapsidating a large number of Pseudomonas mRNAs, except for the ribosomal RNA, which is the most abundant cell RNA [36] . As was found in the case of FHV through the use of a next-generation sequencing technique, VLPs mostly encapsidate ribosomal RNA and the transcripts from the introduced baculovirus expression vectors. Interestingly, native FHV virions also exhibit the ability to package host RNAs, although these particles package only approximately 1 % of the total amount [110] . To identify the RNA secondary structures that are responsible for the encapsidation process, the SELEX system was recently developed for nucleic acid-binding tests with the plant virus STNV VLPs. After 10 rounds of selection, no single RNA stem loop was identified as a potential VLP assembly initiation site; instead, eight different secondary structures in the SNTV genome partially corresponded to the consensus sequence found by the SELEX method [111] . These data suggest a possible mechanism for host nucleic acid encapsidation in the recombinant VLPs: if the transcriptoma of the heterologous host with the cloned viral structural gene contains RNA(s) with the necessary secondary structures in sufficient amounts, these can serve as factors that stimulate or even initiate the VLP formation.\n",
            " In many cases, the construction of VLPs is tightly bound with the aim to obtain structured multimeric protein assemblies with specific properties for subsequent applications. In the case of a successful construction, VLPs are to some extent ''universal,'' e.g., useful for different purposes with the same or a similar principle of action, which is highly important for the development of the technology platform. In this section, the examples of VLPs with noticeable universal properties are discussed.\n",
            " First, VLPs can be used for different purposes based on their intrinsic properties without any changes to the structural proteins. Mammalian VLPs recognize cells from the corresponding organism and are able to deliver cargo, such as therapeutic nucleic acids or proteins, to the recipient organism [112, 113] . The ability to bind specific nucleic acids is common for viral structural proteins and is used for the binding and encapsidation of other negatively charged substances, such as oligonucleotides and biological and chemical polymers, as shown with the recombinant HBcAg, Qb, and CCMV VLPs [114] [115] [116] . This binding property seems to be universal. However, the packaging is limited by the size of the negatively charged polymer. This limitation is apparently bound by the internal volume of the corresponding VLPs and the availability of positively charged AAs in the VLP structure. Therefore, the polyomavirus JC VLPs, which are gene therapy vector candidates, are able to package different plasmid DNAs in sizes that exceed 9 kbp but not 14.5 kbp during the cultivation of E. coli cells [117] .\n",
            " In addition to the packaging, VLP intrinsic properties, such as surface-located AA regions, can serve as targets for the introduction of various functional molecules. There are two general methods for introducing molecules into the carrier VLPs: chemical coupling and genetic fusion. In the chemical coupling process, any method that is known to modify a protein can be used provided that the conditions of the reaction preserve the structural integrity of the VLPs. In most cases, the surface-located lysine residues are targets for coupling [118] , although other AAs, such as cysteine, tyrosine, aspartic, and glutamic acids, can also be modified [13] . Some VLPs are shown to possess nearly universal properties for chemical conjugation; one of the best-studied VLPs with this property is the plant virus CPMV [119] . Other VLPs, such as those derived from the bacteriophages Qb and AP205 have been validated for the coupling of different antigens, including low-molecular substances, such as nicotine and whole proteins, with the aim to obtain prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines [120] [121] [122] [123] .\n",
            " For VLPs without reactive AAs on the surface, the necessary universality can be achieved by targeted mutagenesis, as shown in the case of TMV. After the incorporation of an accessible lysine residue, the subsequent coupling of biotin moieties to the virus enabled the tight binding of 2,200 molecules of recombinant streptavidin-containing model protein per viral particle [124] . The introduction of AAs such as cysteine to some VLPs has been found to be useful for the subsequent coupling and multivalent display of ligands [125] .\n",
            " Genetic methods have been widely used for the introduction of different peptides, including immunologically relevant epitopes, to the VLP structure [1] . In addition, the introduction of specific peptides can contribute to the broadening of the potential VLP applications. Recently, the heterodimeric coiled-coil AA motifs were found to be useful for the packaging of different proteins in the VLP interior without chemical coupling or genetic fusions [126, 127] . The interaction between the coiled-coil motif-containing CCMV CP and the protein of interest insured a strong binding between the two components, which allowed the encapsidation of up to 14 molecules of the model protein inside the 28 nm CCMV particle.\n",
            " The introduction of a whole protein into the VLP structure can also be achieved by genetic fusion, especially in the case of larger VLPs [112, 128] . A versatile system called SplitCore was recently developed for the HBcAg VLPs [129] . The splitting of the HBcAg gene at the encoded immunodominant region into two parts and the expression of both fragments in E. coli retained the ability of VLP formation. This system allows the display of several proteins of medicinal relevance, which have sizes of more than 300 AA, on the VLP surface. This splitting principle is also applicable to other VLPs [129] .\n",
            " Another interesting development that has made VLPs suitable for different applications is the incorporation of protein A-derived domains in the particle structure. These domains are known to effectively bind to the constant regions of the antibody molecules (IgG) of different organisms. After displaying this domain on the particle surface, the VLPs are able to bind up to 2 g of IgG per 1 g of carrier [130] , which offers a simple procedure for the purification of different monoclonal antibodies. VLPs with protein A domains and bound antibodies can also be used for the addressed delivery of therapeutic nucleic acid to specific cells [131] or as sensitive diagnostic agents [132] . Other examples of multifunctional VLPs for protein delivery can be found in a recent review [133] .\n",
            " The latest metagenomic evaluations suggest that virologists are using less than 1 % of the existing viral diversity [134] . Therefore, the environmental samples represent an inexhaustible source of new viral structural genes, from which new VLPs with defined properties can be constructed. However, the construction process of new VLPs is still expensive and labor-intensive. The use of mammalian expression systems is acceptable for the construction of structurally complicated VLPs, particularly if the introduction of the correct post-translational modifications and/ or the production of VLPs that contain multiple structural proteins are necessary. As confirmed by numerous experiments, insect and yeast cell systems can be an effective alternative to mammalian hosts. However, when the construction of a new VLP is considered, E. coli hosts should first be tested because these hosts have lower costs and require a shorter construction time. Due to the absence of generally applicable, rapid screening methods and the inefficiency of in silico predictions, the only approach that can be used to construct new and modify existing VLPs is the trial and error method with subsequent visual confirmation by electron microscopy [135] .\n",
            " Taking into account the advances in vaccine development, VLPs have a positive reputation as systems of academic, industrial, and commercial significance and are no longer only ''mere laboratory curiosities'' [14] . However, in some fields, such as gene therapy and nanomaterials, the potential VLP application technologies are based only on laboratory experiments. The study of the most perspective VLP-based objects and applications must be continued to demonstrate the predictability, sustainability, and cost efficiency of this technology.\n",

            "Title: Solid-State NMR for Studying the Structure and Dynamics of Viral Assemblies\n",
            "Body Text: Solid-state NMR is a structural biology approach that can provide unique information about the molecular assemblies used by viruses to enter host cells, to establish infection and to ensure that progeny virions are released into the environment. Solid-state NMR can contribute to an understanding of how viral proteins and their assemblies function from a structural point of view, revealing weak spots which can be targeted to fight infection through antiviral therapies or vaccines. Solid-state NMR is in this respect complementary to solution NMR, X-ray crystallography and electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), the other atomic-resolution structural biology methods. All can provide images of proteins at resolutions on the order of 1-10 Å. Considering large assemblies, X-ray crystallography was the first approach used to resolve viral capsid and envelope structures at high resolution, and was pioneered by Michael Rossmann and Stephen C. Harrison on plant viruses [1, 2] , owing to the enormous numbers of progeny viruses per cell that plants produce. Advances in recombinant DNA as well as cell culture technology opened the way to mammalian viruses [3, 4] . This approach has subsequently revealed a wide variety of capsid structures, amongst them capsids from rhinovirus [5] , poliovirus [6] and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [7] , as other early examples of human pathogens. The typical resolution of the structures is around 2-3 Å, but a higher resolution below 1.5 Å has been reached for several viruses (see www.pdb.org). For X-ray structures, at 2.5 Å, the backbone is well-defined and many, though not all, sidechains are visible; at 1.5 Å, most sidechains are well-defined (and in the correct rotameric state) The anisotropic interactions can be averaged out using MAS, which results in a single resonance line centered at the isotropic chemical shift of the spin. In addition, spinning sidebands may appear. This spin can be correlated to a neighboring spin, in the example, the amide 1 H to the amide 15 N. Twodimensional spectroscopy then shows peaks which represent, for the present example, the amide proton frequency in one dimension, and the nitrogen frequency in the other. Such a signal will be observed for every NH pair in the protein. The resonance-line position is given by the isotropic part of NMR chemical shift and is usually specified in ppm (parts per million) of the resonance frequency. To obtain high-resolution spectra, the linewidth should be as narrow as possible, as this allows to distinguish (resolve) a maximum of resonances. A narrowing of linewidths can be achieved by (i) using a spectrometer operating at a higher magnetic field, (ii) improving sample homogeneity and symmetry, and (iii) reducing the dipolar coupling interactions by decreasing the density of protons in the system (through protein deuteration, for example) and/or increasing the MAS frequency by using smaller diameter rotors.\n",
            " Solid-state NMR is thus a technique which can address structure and detailed conformation of proteins which are \"not soluble\". This term must be understood in the broader sense, often simply meaning that they are involved in molecular interactions leading to larger superstructures, either with lipids for membrane proteins, or with each other, as in molecular assemblies such as molecular The anisotropic interactions can be averaged out using MAS, which results in a single resonance line centered at the isotropic chemical shift of the spin. In addition, spinning sidebands may appear. This spin can be correlated to a neighboring spin, in the example, the amide 1 H to the amide 15 N. Two-dimensional spectroscopy then shows peaks which represent, for the present example, the amide proton frequency in one dimension, and the nitrogen frequency in the other.

            " Still, the solid-state linewidth is typically somewhat broader than in solution-state NMR, which results in a higher spectral crowding than in solution, and limits the protein size to be investigated. Thus, further improvements in MAS frequency (>100 kHz [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] ) and magnetic field strength (>800 MHz or 18.8 Tesla; note that magnetic field strength is conventionally expressed in units of the proton resonance frequency) will be important for the study of larger proteins. Typically, going from 800 MHz to 1.2 GHz increases the signal-to-noise ratio by nearly a factor of 2. But already today, the combination of 100 kHz MAS, high magnetic fields (>800 MHz) ( Figure 1 ) and improved sample preparation, e.g., by direct sedimentation [37, 38] , allows for high-resolution spectroscopy of large biomolecular assemblies like viral capsids or envelopes [35, [39] [40] [41] if they show high local symmetry. If the protein-monomers forming the assemblies are structurally diverse, this results in the observation of multiple sets of NMR signals (see also below), and increases spectral crowding or line widths if the splittings are unresolved. Solid-state NMR is thus a technique which can address structure and detailed conformation of proteins which are \"not soluble\". This term must be understood in the broader sense, often simply meaning that they are involved in molecular interactions leading to larger superstructures, either with lipids for membrane proteins, or with each other, as in molecular assemblies such as molecular machines, protein fibrils, viral capsids or envelopes. \"Solid\" in this context means that the proteins do not show fast enough molecular tumbling (with correlation times of tens of nanoseconds) to be addressed by solution-state NMR. In a first approximation, therefore, the most attractive targets for solid-state NMR are large assemblies of many relatively small subunits, the latter being important to avoid excessive signal overlap in the spectra.\n",
            " As mentioned, an additional important feature of solid-state NMR is its ability to characterize dynamic processes by observing relaxation times and exchange effects [42] . For an NMR spectroscopist, dynamics is usually associated with a timescale (the correlation time) and an amplitude (the order parameter), while structural virology dynamics is more associated with the volume of the conformational space for the protein. Dynamics on the pico-and nanosecond timescale (backbone and sidechain motion) can be characterized by relaxation measurements, while microsecond dynamics often leads to very efficient relaxation. In solid-state NMR spectra, dynamic entities (often loops but sometimes entire domains) may completely vanish from the spectrum as a consequence of such dynamics [43] . While limiting the possibilities for structure determination, the ability to assign a defined range of motional timescale to the corresponding residues provides valuable dynamic information.\n",
            " As in solution-state NMR, the chemical shifts in MAS solid-state NMR give a fingerprint of a protein, which can be used to easily assess structural differences arising, for example, in the presence of interactants. This is of central importance in viral proteins, which often show multiple functions and thus also interactions, during which they change conformation to adapt to the specific role they need to fulfill at a specific point in the viral life cycle.\n",
            " A major challenge, as for all structural techniques, is the isolation of appropriate virus-like or capsid-like particles (VLPs and CLPs, respectively) from cell culture, or to in-vitro reconstruct the viral protein and its interactants one seeks to investigate. As most solid-state NMR approaches rely on the availability of stable-isotope-labeled protein preparations ( 2 H, 13 C, 15 N) [44] , isolation of VLPs or CLPs is often impractical; for HBV capsids, for instance, this would require large-scale cultures of HBV-producing human hepatoma cells growing on isotope-labeled medium, and efficient separation methods. For bacterial viruses, this is much less challenging, and solid-state NMR has successfully been used to investigate Pf1 bacteriophages directly as sediments from ultracentrifugation [45, 46] . However, the phage structure is composed mainly of a single protein, and the viral genome is difficult to observe under standard conditions. The DNA signals could be assigned using selective unlabeling of the protein [47, 48] or dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) [49, 50] , a technique providing signal intensity enhancement using transfer polarization from unpaired electron spins to nuclear spins at low temperatures (typically 100 K) although at the cost of limited spectral resolution (for a review on DNP see [51] ).\n",
            " Another limitation for the investigation of authentic viral particles directly by solid-state NMR is that, while biosafe probes have been designed for the investigation of amyloid proteins [52] , they do not reach the safety provided by a biosafety level 3 laboratory often needed for the study of infectious material.\n",
            " Another challenge is to obtain the amounts of material needed for NMR structural analysis. Until recently, solid-state NMR samples routinely comprised >20 mg of pure protein. With the advent of advanced proton-detection fast MAS techniques, proteins can now be analyzed in 0.7 mm and even 0.5 mm rotors which reach over 150 kHz MAS frequencies (Figure 1a) , yielding well-resolved Viruses 2020, 12, 1069 6 of 26 proton-nitrogen correlation spectra [29, [34] [35] [36] 53] . The concomitant reduction in sample sizes to the sub-milligram level enables the use of alternative production techniques to bacterial expression. Still, several hundred micrograms of pure protein are usually required, and the isolation of sufficient amounts of authentic viruses, moreover in a single, defined maturation state, would require truly large-scale mammalian cell cultures; complexity in vivo is often further increased by dynamic modifications such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events.\n",
            " Hence NMR specimens are typically not entire virions from patients or cell culture, but rather recombinant purified proteins, or their assembly products such as capsids or envelopes, typically around 500 µg per sample, which are centrifuged directly out of a liquid phase as a sediment into the NMR rotor ( Figure 1a ). This technique yields good-quality spectra [37, 38] and usually keeps the samples stable and hydrated for months if not years [54] . NMR experiments are usually performed near room temperature (−10 • C to 40 • C).\n",
            " 3.2. The Size of the Proteins and Their Assemblies Amenable to \"High Resolution\" Solid-State NMR Solid-state NMR has a strength for assemblies that are large but consist of small, optimally identical, repeating units, as is true for many viral capsids and envelopes. Indeed, only a single set of signals is expected for a core protein, even if many equivalent copies (hundreds for helical symmetry, 60 for T = 3 and T = 4 icosahedral symmetry) make up the viral capsid under investigation. If there are N non-equivalent monomers in the unit cell, N peaks may be observed per nucleus, depending on the conformational differences. If they are sizeable, the different peaks are resolved; if they are smaller, they may lead to line broadening or have no effect. While these effects add to the information contents of the spectra [55] (see also below), they also increase spectral overlap, which can be detrimental for large proteins. Solid-state NMR does not require long-range order of the biological assembly, as long as the monomeric subunits feature a similar chemical environment at the atomic level. More complex assemblies containing larger and/or more different proteins however become increasingly difficult to study in native forms, since the complexity of NMR spectra increases with the sheer number of amino-acid residues present. Although solid-state NMR does not have the intrinsic size limitations of liquid-state NMR, where larger proteins give ever broader NMR lines, spectral overlap complicates analysis, such that objects of more than~500 inequivalent amino acids are difficult to resolve.\n",
            " An important point to be considered is that most NMR techniques rely on labeling of the proteins with NMR-active stable isotopes such as 13 C and 15 N, in some cases also 2 H ( 2 H is an NMR-active nucleus with spin 1, but is here not detected; rather it dilutes the dense 1 H network to further reduce the distance-dependent 1 H-1 H dipolar couplings, in order to further narrow 1 H lines). Stable isotope labeling can indeed be achieved in mammalian cell cultures [56] , but at larger scales (see above) this rapidly becomes very costly, and is thus best achieved by employing high-yield systems for protein production.\n",
            " As a result, solid-state NMR of viral proteins relies largely on recombinantly produced material, which under appropriate conditions can be a valid, high homogeneity model, as is often confirmed by EM and X-ray crystallography. E. coli expression is the major workhorse here, offering straightforward isotope labeling of proteins. Genuine E. coli toolboxes have been developed for several viruses, able to produce assemblies mimicking defined in vivo states, e.g., residue-specific phosphorylation (for example [57] ) thus allowing the exploration of the conformational space of viral proteins. As demands in sample quantity are diminishing (see above), other production approaches have recently been developed, and a highly attractive compromise between expression in eukaryotic cells vs. E. coli is the use of eukaryotic cell-free systems, optimally one that combines high expression yields with an increased folding capacity and access to a range of post-translational modifications [58] . One such system is based on wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis (WG-CFPS) [40, 41, 59, 60] . The high efficiency and selectivity of isotopic labeling constitutes a major asset of this system for NMR studies. Importantly, and in contrast to cell-based production, only the protein of interest is isotopically labeled [61] , enabling sample preparation without extensive purification. This is of particular interest, for example, for the study of ribonucleoprotein complexes which form directly during the cell-free synthesis reaction. In addition, metabolic scrambling of labels between different amino acids is much lower than in E. coli, and can further be minimized by using transaminase inhibitors and glutamine synthase inhibitors [62, 63] . WG-CFPS is particularly attractive for deuteration, often used to reduce proton linewidths [64, 65] , as in contrast to bacterial expression it does not require proton back-exchange, circumventing denaturation and refolding steps which could compromise the native folding of proteins. WG-CFPS indeed allows for the simple addition of deuterated amino acids to the translation reaction performed in H 2 O medium. Selective labeling, by adding only the desired labeled amino acid to the translation reaction, can efficiently be performed in WG-CFPS [59, 62, 63, 66] , and help to significantly reduce the complexity of NMR spectra, as shown, for instance, by the successful application to the NS4B protein of hepatitis C virus [60] (see below). Another complexity-reducing approach is segmental labeling, whereby only part of a protein sequence is isotopically labeled while the remaining parts remain invisible. This was successfully applied to HIV-1 in tubular assemblies [67] and in spherical CLPs formed by the capsid protein [68] . Other schemes can be used, with those where only one partner is labeled particularly relevant for interaction studies, where the non-isotopically-labeled partner(s) remain(s) invisible, and all information on changes is contained in the target protein spectra [69] . Alternatively, labeling protocols using selectively 13 C-labeled glucose (1-13 C or 2-13 C) as a carbon source during protein expression [70] can be used to improve spectral resolution and determine intermolecular restraints, as demonstrated on molecular machines such as the type III secretion system needle [71] . This technique has not yet been employed for viral assemblies but could be useful to study contacts between capsids subunits.\n",
            " High sample purity is required to reach maximal NMR signal strength, yet low-level contaminants (<5-10% of the total sample) will typically be invisible in the NMR spectra.\n",
            " Once the proteins are labeled, 2D and 3D NMR spectra are recorded at an MAS frequency that depends on the rotor size used (typically 17 kHz for 3.2 mm rotors to 100 kHz for 0.7 mm ones). In multi-dimensional spectra, each dimension corresponds to the recording of an 1 H, 15 N or 13 C magnetization's free induction decay over time, which is then Fourier-transformed in order to yield a frequency-domain spectrum, ideally containing a peak for each 1 H, 15 N or 13 C nucleus in the protein.\n",
            " Multi-dimensional spectra help to resolve overlap which would be very high in one-dimensional spectra. In these spectra, a residue is characterized by a \"douple\" and triple of resonance frequencies in the 2 or 3 dimensions, respectively, e.g., 15 N, 13 CA, 13 CO intra-residual correlations. A combination of those nuclei with 3D spectra enables to create inter-residual connections by correlating, for example, the 15 N of one residue with the 13 CO/ 13 CA of the preceding one. Such schemes thus connect the amide 15 N to both directions of the protein backbone, and allow for sequential resonance assignments [53, [72] [73] [74] [75] . This eventually enables to associate an NMR signal or frequency to every atom in the protein.\n",
            " Once the NMR fingerprint is assigned (i.e., all signals and thus frequencies in the spectra are assigned to a nucleus), it is easy to follow conformational changes induced by the addition of a ligand or any other event, by simply following the chemical-shift differences and localizing them on a known 3D structure. Important examples are protein-nucleic acid complexes, where structural changes can in principle even be followed via the chemical shifts from both sides. Protein and RNA or DNA can either be labeled at the same time, e.g., when preparing a viral capsid in E. coli in media containing labeled amino acids and nucleic-acid building blocks, or be labeled separately if one can reassemble the capsid in vitro with labeled or unlabeled RNA, as it is the case for HBV capsids [76] .\n",
            " Protein structure determination by solid-state NMR involves combining dihedral angle restraints derived from chemical shifts [77] with distance restraints derived from dipolar couplings. These restraints can then be used to computationally find a solution that fulfills as many of them as possible. The detailed outcome of this optimization depends on the initial condition [78] [79] [80] . The best solutions constitute the NMR \"bundle\", which characterizes the possible range of conformations for the protein. Due to signal overlap, de novo structure determination from solid-state NMR data is currently limited to proteins of up to about 200 amino acids in length. Only a few viral protein structures have been determined de novo using solid-state NMR today.\n",
            " NMR can efficiently assess interactions with small molecules, which is extensively used in drug screening by solution NMR [81, 82] . For solid-state NMR, high-throughput screening is not yet routinely available, but first compatible sample changers have been developed. Screening can thus be done, though with limited efficiency, providing access to the rich information of NMR chemical shifts and allowing a detailed analysis of interactions with small molecules by similar approaches as in solution. A particular strength of solid-state NMR in such applications is the availability of side-chain information directly from 2D 13 C correlation spectra, which indicates which 13 C nuclei are spatially nearby the interacting site.\n",
            " Some of the first viral targets in MAS solid-state NMR were bacteriophages, serving as relatively simple model systems for NMR methods development. Major advantages were their often small coat proteins, which can be readily prepared in stable-isotope-labeled form, and the absence of an envelope, presenting a system containing just one principal structural element (reviewed by [83] and more recently by [84] ). Studies of intact filamentous bacteriophages were described recently [50] . In parallel, solid-state NMR on membrane proteins progressed further, first on oriented samples [85] and then by MAS methods, and the study of small viral membrane peptides set the stage for the emerging analyses of much more complex samples such as membrane proteins from human viruses. Figure 2 shows a selection of human viruses and their proteins studied by solid-state NMR today (with red labels), aiming to gain an insight into their dynamics and structure, and their interactions with viral genomes as well as cellular membranes.\n",
            " Several studies have addressed the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), with an emphasis on the capsid and gp41 fusion proteins ( Figure 2a ). Influenza virus, notably its M2 ion channel, has been the topic of several studies (Figure 2b ), studies on measles virus nucleocapsids have also been initiated (Figure 2c ), and more recently hepatitis B virus (HBV) proteins, both from the duck HBV model and the human virus (Figure 2d ), have been addressed. In addition, non-structural membrane proteins from the hepatitis C virus (HCV), such as the p7 ion channel and NS4B, are challenging current subjects (Figure 2e ). Below we summarize first the successes and then the remaining challenges, with a focus on proteins from pathogenic human viruses. \n",
            " Viral capsids are superstructures formed by core protein(s) in complex with the viral genome. They usually represent assemblies with high local symmetries, often icosahedral, but they can also have irregular shapes. Their obvious function is to protect the viral genome, but they have often multiple roles in the viral life cycle. To fulfill these diverse functions, e.g., intracellular transport and trafficking, entry and egress from the host cell, they have structures that can change over time and on demand. Their overall shapes can best be addressed by cryo-EM, but the dynamics of their functional domains let them frequently escape detection by this method. Similarly, structural details can go undetected, since even the resolution achievable nowadays may be insufficient to clearly pinpoint subtle changes between states.\n",
            " Solid-state NMR investigations of the HIV-1 capsid were initiated by Polenova and coworkers some years ago. The viral capsid comprises 1500 copies of the 26 kDa capsid protein (CA) and forms a characteristic cone-shaped cage around two copies of the viral genomic RNA (Figure 2a) . The structural organization of the mature capsid was defined as a \"fullerene cone\" based on cryo-EM images [88] (Figure 3a,b) . CA comprises an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), connected by a flexible linker, the hinge region. NMR spectra of HIV-1 CA, obtained and assigned using sediments of conical and spherical assemblies, formed the basis for structural and dynamic investigations by this and other groups (reviewed in [89] and [90] ). NMR revealed that, despite the very different morphologies of the investigated particles, the individual CA proteins adopt very similar structures therein [91] . Probing dynamic behavior on the nano-to microsecond time scales through measurements of chemical-shift anisotropy (CSA) tensors revealed that the CA hinge region is flexible on the millisecond time scale (the chemical shift is not an isotropic quantity described by a number, but is mathematically described by a second-rank tensor, characterized by a 3 × 3 matrix.

            " This conformational flexibility was suggested to be essential for the CA protein to adopt multiple and slightly different conformations in the assembled capsid [92] . In a similar approach, Polenova and coworkers identified the interaction of CA with the host protein Cyclophilin A (CypA), which regulates HIV-1 viral infectivity through direct interactions with the viral capsid. 1 H-15 N and 1 H-13 C dipolar tensors and NMR peak intensities revealed that dynamics on the microsecond-to-nanosecond timescale in the CypA binding loop are important for HIV-1 s escape from CypA dependence [93] (again, the dipolar interaction is described by a second rank tensor, which is normally averaged but can be re-introduced to reveal dynamic averaging). More recently, NMR chemical shift and dipolar tensors were measured in HIV-1 CA tubular assemblies (Figure 3c,d) . This revealed, in combination with molecular dynamics and theoretical calculations, a drastic decrease in dynamics for residues in the CypA-binding loop of the tubular assemblies upon interaction with CypA [94] . Moreover, the interaction of CA with the restriction factor TRIM5α has recently been described by such a combined approach [95] . In parallel, solid-state NMR studies in combination with EM by Tycko and coworkers have shown that CTD and NTD of CA tubular assembly samples are largely rigid and that they immobilize their general secondary and tertiary structure upon formation of tubes [96] .

            " The HBV core protein has been accessible in recombinant form from early on, and its structure has been extensively investigated by EM and X-ray approaches [7, 14, [100] [101] [102] . Still, it needed advanced biochemistry to develop expression systems adequate for the production of the full-length form, Cp183 [76] , which in contrast to the truncated Cp149 used in most structural studies, packs nucleic acids. The HBV capsid structure is dynamic, and is believed to change/adapt according to the different roles the protein has at different points in its viral life cycle. Its main function is to serve as the building block of the nucleocapsid shell surrounding the pgRNA and viral polymerase. Cp expressed in bacteria assembles into icosahedral particles closely resembling those seen in infected liver [101] . The predominant icosahedral T = 4 capsid contains 240 copies of Cp in 120 dimeric subunits, and comprises four groups of symmetrically non-equivalent subunits arranged as 60 AB and CD homodimers (Figure 3e ). The 20 kDa core protein contains an N-terminal domain of 140 residues, required for the assembly into capsid, joined by a 9-residues linker to an arginine-rich C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 150 to 183) responsible for several essential functions, including pgRNA binding [103] . The dynamic structure of the CTD and its interactions with the viral RNA remains one of the blind spots in capsid investigations today. Furthermore, the hypothesized conformational changes of the capsid believed to signal readiness for envelopment [104] , or alternatively the predicted single-strand blocking signal [105] , have escaped detection as of today.\n",
            " The HBV capsid has recently been subject to solid-state NMR studies on capsids isolated from E. coli cells where they auto-assemble (Figure 3f ). The sequential 1 H/ 13 C/ 15 N assignments have been established as a basis for further studies [35, 106] . The NMR spectra yielded high-resolution NMR fingerprints (Figure 3g) , with linewidths similar to those obtained from the HIV capsids, confirming that this type of symmetrical object is well in the scope of solid-state NMR. A comparison between the chemical shifts of the core protein in its dimeric and capsid states revealed the residues which structurally adapt upon shell assembly [106] . The slight non-symmetry (\"quasiequivalence\") between the four subunits was reflected in the NMR spectra [55] , in which multiple peaks are observed for~20% of residues located at the dimer-dimer interfaces at the five-and six-fold symmetry axes (Figure 3g,h) , as shown at the example of Ala137. Hence the high sensitivity of NMR chemical-shifts to structural variations allowed the exact pinpointing of the residues where subtle local conformational adaptations are needed for lattice formation, i.e., the molecular hinges [55] .\n",
            " As described above, the development of proton-detected fast MAS NMR spectroscopy beyond 100 kHz sample rotation has recently made it possible to study sub-milligram amounts of protein samples, and enabled proton assignments of HBV Cp, using less than 500 µg of capsids [35] . With the proton resonances assigned, this approach can now be used for further interaction studies, with cellular partners that are available in small quantities, as well as with antivirals like the capsid assembly modulators (CAMs, also called core protein allosteric modulators, CpAMs). CAMs are currently under pharmaceutical development for targeting viral nucleocapsid assembly [107, 108] ; they act by either promoting assembly of regularly appearing but genome-less capsids, or they induce the formation of aberrantly shaped irregular multimers, which are not functional in viral replication; notably, recent data suggest that this distinction is not always strict in that the concentration of a compound and the time it is in contact can affect the morphological outcome [109] . In this context, the use of cell-free synthesis systems for sample preparation is particularly interesting as assembly modulators can act directly on the capsid protein exiting from the ribosome, and hence in a preassembly state. The sub-milligram Cp183 capsids obtained through cell-free protein synthesis are fully sufficient for the smaller sample requirements of fast MAS NMR, and they can simply be sedimented into a 0.7 mm NMR rotor after purification on a sucrose gradient (Figure 4a ) [40] . The capsids directly pack nucleic acids during cell-free synthesis, and only the full-length protein successfully assembles in the system. In the presence of a heteroaryldihydropyrimidine (HAP) CAM, the cell-free Cp183 capsids opened up completely (Figure 4b ) [40] , indicating suitability of this system for solid-state NMR analysis. These data show how the combination of WG-CFPS and solid-state NMR can open the way for a better understanding of the action of CAMs under conditions that more closely mimic the situation in a cell.\n",

N is composed of two globular domains, the N-and C-terminal domains, which together form a stable peanutshaped nucleoprotein core of 400 residues (NCORE), responsible for self-assembly and RNA binding.

An interesting and medically relevant example are recombinant HBV subviral particles (SVPs) comprising just the small envelope protein S, which can efficiently be produced in yeast and serves as the active constituent of the HBV vaccine. During HBV infection, similar non-infectious SVPs, containing all three envelope proteins and host phospholipids, are secreted by infected cells in huge excess over virions [113, 114] . Yeast expression of the SVPs is not compatible with NMR analyses, since isotope labeling is too costly as 13 C methanol must also be fed during the long maturation steps.

This system was recently used to assemble SVPs from the S envelope protein of the related duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) [41] (Figure 6a,b) , in a similar manner to the HBV capsids [40] (Figure 4a,b) . The addition of mild detergent allowed for the production of milligram amounts of these integral membrane protein assemblies, and a simple sedimentation after sucrose gradient isolation enabled NMR sample preparation [41] .

Both proteins are activated by low pH to mediate virus uncoating. AM2 conducts protons with strong inward rectification, while BM2 conducts protons both inward and outward. The structure of their trans-membrane channel domain has been extensively characterized by NMR spectroscopy, Xray crystallography, and other physical methods [131] . Solid-state NMR added important information on the structure of the AM2 proton channel, thanks to seven successive studies: the structure of the monomeric transmembrane region was solved in 2001 [132] , followed by the structure of the full transmembrane domain in lipid bilayers, in free form [133] and in complex with amantadine [134] [135] [136] , an antiviral able to block the M2 ion channel pore. Additional information was gained from the structures of the drug-resistant AM2 mutant S31N [137, 138] , showing that amantadine resistance of mutant S31N is caused by steric hindrance.

Two HCV proteins have been subject to solid-state NMR studies, p7 and NS4B.\n",
            " P7 protein is a small, hydrophobic transmembrane protein that participates in viral assembly and release. This 63-amino acid protein is generally categorized as a viroporin because it can oligomerize as hexamers to form ion channels in host cell membranes. Its structure is made up of seven different sections, amongst which four are helical segments. Early solid-state NMR studies of p7 aligned in phospholipid bilayers, providing the tilt angles of two of these segments [142] and a topology model of the protein in this environment [143] . p7 contains two trans-membrane helices, while HIV-1 Vpu has only one. Comparison of the solid-state NMR structures of both viroporins revealed significant differences in the structures and dynamics of their internal loop and terminal regions [144] . In both cases, solid-state NMR was compared to solution-state NMR data obtained in micelles, and Opella and coworkers first identified the localization of the transmembrane domains of p7 and Vpu in lipid bilayers. Unfortunately, the full p7 structure in lipids could not yet be solved, as this would help to resolve contrasting data between different detergent-based solution NMR studies [145] [146] [147] [148] [149] ; the membrane might actually play a central role in determining p7 structure and oligomerization.\n",
            " Another HCV protein on which studies in lipids are underway is the nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B). NS4B is a 27 kDa alpha-helical integral membrane protein of 261 amino acid residues. While the NS4B 3D structure has not been solved yet, a topology model is available [150] ; it proposes that membrane association of NS4B is mediated by both transmembrane domains in its central parts, and determinants for membrane association in the N-and C-terminal regions [151] . However, given its important role for HCV, the need for more detailed structural information on NS4B is evident. A solid-state NMR study combined with molecular dynamic calculations looked at the second amphipathic helix of NS4B (AH2), known to promote remodeling events that are essential in viral replication [152] . Using a synthetic peptide reconstituted into lipids, the authors showed that AH2 promotes the clustering of negatively charged lipids within the bilayer, facilitating the remodeling of the latter, and increasing the disassociation of AH2 oligomers. Yet, insight into the multiple functions of NS4B which might be governed by distinct membrane topologies and/or interactions with other viral and cellular proteins [151] would be greatly supported by detailed structural information on the full-length protein. Again, WG-CFPS represents an attractive alternative to the poor expression of NSB4 in bacteria. Indeed, allowing for the addition of various additives, including detergents, this system enabled the production of full-length, well-folded and soluble NS4B in milligram amounts, compatible with structural studies [153, 154] . The detergent-solubilized NS4B protein was affinity-purified, and then reinserted into lipids to mimic the native membranous environment [59, 67, 155] . A technical issue in such a reconstitution experiment is finding the optimal lipid-to-protein ratio (LPR) for NMR samples, because the LPR needs to be high enough to ensure a well-folded protein, but as low as possible to maximize protein amounts in the NMR rotor [44] . Adapting recent fast reconstitution schemes [156] has allowed to screen different lipid compositions directly by NMR to optimize resolution [67] . This enabled the recording of 2D and 3D 1 H-detected NMR spectra, both on fully and selectively labeled NS4B and to initiate sequential assignments [67] (Figure 8 ). Two protein segments could be assigned, one validated the structural model, while the other did not confirm the predicted helix. For further work, higher magnetic fields will be an essential ingredient to push the structural understanding of this complex protein.\n",

Another interesting new option is the combination of solid-state NMR with cryo-EM in a hybrid structural approach, as established, for example, for amyloid fibrils [157, 158] .

The viral genetic material is amplified through this technique, and if the person is infected actively, it can be detected.

            " There is a chance of infection while treating the patient with a live virus Manopo et al. (2005) was found that \"The Spike protein may mediate membrane fusion and induce neutralization antibodies in the host, raising the possibility that antibodies against the SARS-CoV Spike protein may be a good marker for early detection and neutralization of SARS-CoV infections\" (Manopo et al., 2005) . Therefore, detection of the SARS-CoV spike protein could be a rapid, accurate, and highly sensitive diagnostic method. In addition, it eliminates the risk of contamination. The objective of this study is to propose a theoretical design of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor that could detect SARS-CoV-2 through an easy and fast procedure. Numerous studies in the literature found the SPR-based biosensor to be an effective, label free, and fast detector for different pathogens, including viruses. Earlier, it was reported that an SPR-based biosensor was able to detect feline calicivirus in 15 min (Bai et al., 2012) . A similar finding was also obtained for human enterovirus 71 (EV71) (Prabowo et al., 2017) . It was found that using an SPR-based biosensor, EV71 could be detected within several minutes.\n",
            " This type of sensor was thus chosen for this design due to its remarkably high sensitivity, detection accuracy, biocompatibility, and, most importantly, speedy detection. Due to these characteristics, it is becoming a crucial sensing technology in the field of biology (Ahmed and Shaban, 2020) , chemistry , and engineering (Khan and Rahman, 2016; Khan, 2012) . The SPR-based sensor is being used in many different applications (Abdulhalim et al., 2008; Bijalwan and Rastogi, 2018; and Nazem et al., 2020) . As the focus of this proposed sensor is virus detection, previous literature that considered SPR-based biosensors for virus detection would be highlighted in brief. The sensing theory of these sensors is widely available in the literature, for example, see Homola (2006) .\n",
            " Many recent studies have considered the SPR-based sensor for medical diagnostic applications. For example, Bai et al. (2012) employed DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) aptamers as a specific identifying component in a transportable SPR-based sensor to detect avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1. The DNA aptamers showed strong binding affinity and high specificity to target AIV H5N1 (Wang et al., 2013) . Thus, Bai et al. (2012) used this aptamer as they found that it \"show(s) comparable affinity for target viruses and better thermal stability than monoclonal antibodies.\" However, this detection took about 1.5 h. In contrast, an antibody-based SPR sensor was used to detect feline calicivirus, a surrogate of norovirus, and took only 15 min (Yakes et al., 2013) . Another study used a pair of aptamers (IF10 and IF22) and developed a sandwich-type SPR biosensor and detected H5N1 whole virus from infected feces (Nguyen et al., 2016) .\n",
            " An impetuous identification of avian influenza virus subtype H6 was proposed through optical fiber-based SPR sensors in Zhao et al. (2016) . Both the core diameter and cladding thickness of 62.5 μm of a graded-index multimode optical fiber were adopted for this sensor. The fiber was side-polished, and a thin gold film of 40 nm thickness was used for the surface plasmon, with a sensing area of 5 mm. In an earlier study, a collection mode SPR sensor was proposed, with some advantages over traditional reflectance based measurement such as a high signal to noise ratio, less dependency on metal film thickness, and detection of seasonal influenza A virus, which were demonstrated to show its applicability (Francois et al., 2011) . In another study, to diagnose different stages of ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv infections caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, an SPR-based biosensor was proposed, which was able to detect the virus from a clinical serum sample (Riedel et al., 2014) . In this sensor, predominantly, the antibodies were detected against the three antigens of the virus. A localized SPR characteristic was employed to design a gold nanorod biosensor to detect hepatitis B virus (Wang et al., 2010) . In detecting the virus, the surface of the nanorod was changed with physical adsorption of the monoclonal hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb). This sensor was able to detect the virus in buffer, blood serum, and plasma. On the other hand, Choi et al. (2014) proposed a plasma-treated parylene-N film based SPR biosensor for human hepatitis B virus. It was claimed by the authors that \"the SPR biosensor with the plasma-treated parylene-N film could achieve more than 1000-fold improved sensitivity in comparison with the conventional ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kit\" (Choi et al., 2014) . Similarly, Uzun et al. (2009) used a hepatitis B surface antibody on a gold SPR chip surface to detect HBsAb in human serum. In a similar fashion, an SPR-based biosensor biochip was also developed to detect infectious bursal disease virus .\n",
            " Recently, an optical sensor (prism-based) used the SPR method to diagnose the dengue virus (DENV) E-protein (Omar et al., 2018) . The dengue virus E-protein was detected \"by measuring the SPR signal when IgM immobilized gold/Fe-MPA-NCC-CTAB/EDC-NHS thin film is exposed to the DENV E-protein solution\" (Omar et al., 2018) . For this sensor, the concentration range was varied between 0.0001 and 10 nM.\n",
            " Apart from these, Shi et al. (2015) developed a biosensor to detect nine respiratory viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, H1N1, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1-3 (PIV1, 2, and 3), and SARS. They employed a gene chip SPR-based biosensor for this detection. In brief, \"The respiratory virus target gene was extracted from bacterial culture samples and amplified by PCR technology; PCR products were then analyzed by SPR technology\" (Shi et al., 2015) . Thus, this virus detection scheme requires a lengthy procedure. Many other previous studies proposed a multilayered (e.g., gold and metamaterials) SPR-based biosensor (Cherifi and Bouhafs, 2017) . However, this was not used for virus detection.\n",
            " Most previous studies used either optical fiber-based (Zhao et al., 2019) or single layered structures for virus detection, using the surface plasmon resonance technique. In contrast, in our proposed sensor, a multilayered structure was used for potential SARS-CoV-2 detection. A single layer structure's metal film might corrode in bio-solution and would consequently reduce the sensor's quality factor and sensitivity (Wu et al., 2019) ; thus, this multi-layer structure was chosen. In addition, recent research found that \"the use of graphene and other layered materials for passivation and functionalization broadens the range of metals which can be used for plasmonic biosensing and increases the sensitivity by 3-4 orders of magnitude, as it guarantees stability of a metal in liquid and preserves the plasmonic resonances under biofunctionalization\" (Wu et al., 2019) .\n",
            " The rest of this article is organized as follows: Sec. II shows the proposed sensor structure. Section III explains the mathematical modeling and method used for this study. Finally, the results are discussed in Sec. IV before concluding the article. \n",
            " The proposed sensor structure comprises six layers with different materials, as shown in Fig. 1 . Silver is used in this sensor for its appreciable plasmonic behavior in SPR-based sensors. In this configuration, to make a sandwich-like structure, a layer of silver (Ag) is inserted between a MoSe 2 -graphene composite layer and a TiO 2 thin sheet. The optical nonlinearity improved with higher operating frequency, and overall performance also improved with the smallest Kerr effect at low operating frequency (Maurya et al., 2015a) . Therefore, the operating light wavelength is chosen as λ = 633 nm, and all the refractive index (RI) values of each material are considered at this wavelength.\n",
            " In this formation, the most practiced constituent is a prism (BK7 glass) with an RI of 1.5151 . The subsequent section on the prism is a TiO 2 layer with an RI of 2.5837 (Maurya et al., 2015a) . Previous studies found that the inclusion of oxide layers such as TiO 2 increases the sensor's sensitivity. For instance, Singh et al. (2013) found that out of three oxide layers, namely, TiO 2 , SiO 2 , and SnO 2 , the maximum sensitivity was obtained for TiO 2 . In addition, TiO 2 is used as the adhesion layer; this makes the nanostructure mechanically stable. Therefore, they can be integrated with a more complicated device or used as plasmonic sensors for liquid or even solid analytes (Ovchinnikov and Shevchenko, 2013) . Furthermore, TiO 2 has a high light-trapping ability when used as an adherence layer on the prism of an SPR-based sensor. Because of greater light-trapping capability, more surface plasmons (SPs) are generated that eventually increase the resonance angle. This increase in the resonance angle will increase the SPR sensing (Maurya et al., 2015b) . Due to these advantages of the TiO 2 layer, this was employed in this proposed sensor. The succeeding layer is silver with a complex RI of 0.1726 + j3.421 (Verma et al., 2015a) . The next two layers are MoSe 2 and graphene with RIs of 4.7954 + j1.2405 (Beal and Hughes, 1979) and 3.0 + j1.1487 (Maharana et al., 2015) , respectively. Finally, to adhere with SARS-CoV-2 testing, the recombinant monoclonal antibody named CR3022 is coated on the graphene layer. The thickness of each layer is also mentioned in Fig. 1 .\n",
            " The enumeration of reflected light intensity has been calculated by using the matrix method as this method requires no approximation for multilayer systems (Verma et al., 2015b) . T k is the thickness along the z-axis of each layer of the nanocomposite sensor structure. n k is used to represent the RI, and ϵ k is used to indicate the permittivity of the material used in the kth layer.\n",
            " The tangential components of both the electric and magnetic fields are continuous at the first surface of the first layer to the last edge of the last layer (Maurya and Prajapati, 2016) ,\n",

(1). U N−1 and v N−1 are the corresponding electric and magnetic fields at the border of the Nth layer, respectively. The characteristic matrix of the composite assembly is represented by Mij, and this equation for p-polarized light can be written as follows :\n",

            " After some upfront mathematical calculating steps without assumption, the coefficient of reflected light represented by the following equation for p-polarized incident light can be obtained: \n",
            " The reflectivity, Rp, of the combined multilayer structure is specified as shown in the following equation:\n",
            " The performance characterization of an SPR-based sensor is basically contingent on the sensitivity, signal to noise ratio (SNR), and quality factor of the sensor. In order to obtain a better performance from an SPR-based biosensor, all the parameter's higher values are preferred, except the full width at half maxima (FWHM) (Verma et al., 2015a) . The detection accuracy or the SNR and the quality factor achieve a higher value with a lower value of the FWHM (Maurya and Prajapati, 2016) . The SPR angle and reflectance attributes change with the change in the RI of the sample analyte. As a fundamental performance indicating parameter, sensitivity is defined as the ratio of SPR angle change to the RI change of the sample analyte [Eq. (8) ]. The RI change of the target analyte leads to a change in the SPR angle, and this parameter is calculated with the unit of deg/RIU (Maharana et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2011) ,\n",
            " Another crucial parameter for SPR-based biosensor is the detection accuracy (DA), which is also known as the SNR, and this can be ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv determined using Eq. (9) from the SPR curve (Homola, 2008) . In addition, detection accuracy or the SNR is a unitless parameter,\n",
            " The FWHM (Δθ 0.5 ), or spectral width, is outlined as the span of the SPR curve for 50% of maximum intensity of reflected light. The parameter that is carrying a lion's share of significance is the quality factor (QF) that depends both on Δθ 0.5 and the sensitivity, and it can be represented as (Homola, 2008 )\n",
            " Notably, the detection accuracy, sensitivity, and quality factor as well as the decreasing value of the FWHM signify an SPR-based biosensor as better (Maurya and Prajapati, 2016) . For the proposed sensor, all the simulations are conducted in MATLAB.\n",
            " A laser of 633 nm wavelength was chosen as the light source for the sensor. The initial RI of the sensing medium is 1.33 RIU, and the increment Δns in RI is considered to be 0.05 RIU. In addition, the initial thickness of the TiO 2 layer is set to 5 nm. To optimize the thickness of the silver layer, we set its initial thickness at 22 nm and took the values of performance parameters and FWHM by varying the thickness up to 58 nm at an incremental rate of 2 nm. Figure 2 (a) shows the variation in sensitivity and the quality factor, with a shift in Ag layer thickness. This curve shows an increasing trend in sensitivity and the quality factor with the increase in silver thickness.\n",
            " The variation in sensitivity and detection accuracy is plotted in Fig. 2(b) with the variation in Ag layer thickness. Although the sensitivity increases with the increase in Ag layer thickness, the detection accuracy decreases initially up to a thickness of 44 nm, and then, it starts to increase again.\n",
            " In addition, the sensitivity is potted against FWHM in Fig. 2 (c) with respect to the thickness of the silver layer. The sensitivity increases with the increase in the thickness of the silver layer. Similarly, the FWHM increases with the increase in the silver layer's thickness up to 46 nm, and then, it starts to decrease gradually. Figure 2 (c) shows that these two lines cross at about 54 nm silver layer thickness. Previous studies found that at a thickness of 55 nm, silver showed a high quality factor with a lower FWHM, compared with the gold film for SPR-based sensor applications (Mukhtar et al., 2018) . However, in this study, 58 nm is found to be the best thickness for silver with respect to the sensitivity, quality factor, and detection accuracy of the proposed sensor. Beyond this thickness, the quality factor and detection accuracy were found to be unchanged. Thus, the thickness of the silver film was chosen as 58 nm for this proposed sensor structure, along with different material layers. In addition, silver in a multi-layered structure was found to have an enhanced quality factor compared to the single layer (Tran et al., 2017) .\n",
            " The performance of the proposed sensor was compared with different layers of materials to check the sensor's overall performance. The refractive index of the sensing medium is given as na = ns + Δns, where Δns represents the variation in the RI of the target solution medium. As shown in Fig. 3 , the reflectance of five SPR sensor structures is presented with the variation in the incident angle, where the structures are (a) Ag, (b) Ag-graphene, (c) Ag-MoSe 2 , (d) Ag-MoSe 2 -graphene, and (e) TiO 2 -Ag-MoSe 2 -graphene. In this computation, the change in the RI of the sensing solution is considered as Δns = 0.005 RIU. As shown in Fig. 3(e) , the shift in the dip in reflectance spectra is the highest after the introduction of the TiO 2 layer with the Ag-MoSe 2 -graphene hybrid structure, which is 0.97 ○ . In contrast, the lowest shift (0.84 ○ ) is observed for the Ag layer only [see Fig. 3(a) ]. In this proposed sensor structure, the graphene layer was used due to its \"significant properties such as strong adsorption of molecules, signal amplification by optical, high carrier mobility, electronic bridging, ease of fabrication and therefore, have established as an important sensitivity enhancement substrate for SPR\" (Patil et al., 2019; Hassan and Khan, 2014) . Due to these characteristics, many recent studies also used the graphene layer for sensor applications (Bijalwan et al., 2020; Moznuzzaman et al., 2020; and Moznuzzaman et al., 2021) .\n",
            " The selected multilayered structure, that is, a TiO 2 layer, a thin silver film, a single sheet of MoSe 2 , and a single graphene sheet, can be implemented by the method of deposit and transfer on a prism. In terms of prism selection, sensitivity, quality factor, and detection accuracy were taken into account, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 3 (f) as a function of the RI of the prism. The highest sensitivity, quality factor, and detection accuracy were found at an RI of 1.5151, and it is a BK7 prism. Thus, the BK7 prism was chosen for this proposed sensor. Due to these characteristics of the BK7 prism, it was used in many previous studies (Cherifi and Bouhafs, 2017; Tran et al., 2017; and Prabowo et al., 2017) . Table II lists the main performance parameters such as sensitivity, quality factor, and detection accuracy of the SPR sensor with different composite structures. It was revealed that the sensor with TiO 2 -Ag-MoSe 2 -graphene multilayers achieved the highest sensitivity. It was found that the proposed sensor's sensitivity (194 ○ /RIU), quality factor (54.0390 RIU −1 ), and detection accuracy (0.2702) outperformed those of other single and multi-layered structures, except the FWHM. Therefore, a TiO 2 -Ag-MoSe 2 -graphene multilayer structure was chosen for the proposed sensor.\n",
            " There are two distinctive roles of antibodies: one is to fix exactly to their specific antigens and the other is to prompt an immune reaction against the engaged antigen by employing other cells and molecules (Sela-Culang et al., 2013) . The pair between an antibody and an antigen includes innumerable non-covalent contacts between the epitope and the paratope (Sela-Culang et al., 2013) . Proper immobilization of antibodies as biorecognition elements on the sensor surface is a significant task in order to achieve better performance of the biosensor (Sahoo et al., 2016) . This immobilization of antibodies on the sensor surface is mostly accomplished by either the physical adsorption method (Wang et al., 2010; Liedberg et al., 1983) , that is, a weak electrostatic bond, or by permanent covalent bonding through revealing functional groups of easily accessible amino acid. Direct and physical immobilization has an advantage: the antibody molecules are very adjacent to the sensing surface, and this is highly conducive for achieving higher sensitivity (Sahoo et al., 2016) . For the proposed sensor, we immobilized CR3022 antibody molecules for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Yuan et al., 2020) . The CR3022 is a \"Recombinant monoclonal antibody to COVID-19 & SARS-CoV S-glycoprotein. Manufactured using AbAb's recombinant platform with variable regions (i.e., specificity) from the B-cell clone CR3022\" (Absolute Antibody, 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-glycoprotein) promotes access into cells and is the key target of the CR3022 antibody (Haynes et al., 2007) . \"This antibody binds the amino acids 318-510 in the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spike protein\" (Absolute Antibody, 2020). The immobilization of SARS-CoV-2 antigens on the CR3022 antibodies increases the RI of the sensing layer, and this increased RI leads to a right shift in the SPR angle. By investigating this angular shift using attenuated total reflection (ATR), the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in the target sample can be determined. Figure 4 (a) shows the reflectance vs incident angle curves. The resonance angle of antibody coating on the graphene layer is 77.67 ○ , whereas the resonance angle with the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution is 77.86 ○ .\n",
            " In this technique, the collected SPR angle shift makes the conditions regarding either the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or not possible. The borderline criterion is signified by\n",
            " where (Δθ Ab−Ag SPR ) min directs the borderline value for the smallest change in the SPR angle. This value is for the PBS solution on the immobilization of antibody coating. As the immobilized CR3022 antibody only attaches to the antigen of SARS-CoV-2, the change in the SPR angle greater than this marginal value determines the existence of SARS-CoV-2. In this account, Eq. (12) (Diéguez et al., 2012) reveals the increase in the RI for increases in the concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 sample solution,\n",
            " scitation.org/journal/adv \n",
            " where cv is the concentration of the virus solution, n 1 represents the RI of the immobilized CR3022 antibody, and the rate of change of RI with the change of concentration of SARS-CoV-2 solution is dn/dc = 0.181 cm 3 /gm (Diéguez et al., 2012) . As the RI of the sensing medium changes with the adsorption of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, the SPR angle shifts rightward and makes a change in the propagation constant. Thus, this proposed improved performance SPR-based sensor is employed to identify SARS-CoV-2 using the angular investigation method. A SARS-CoV-2 solution (range of concentration from 0.0001 to 100 nM) was inserted into the contact of the immobilized CR3022 film on the graphene surface. The SPR curve for SARS-CoV-2 solutions in contact with the specific graphene/CR3022 is shown in Fig. 4(b) . The result shows that the SPR angle shifts insignificantly, i.e., 77.28 ○ to 77.40 ○ , when the target SARS-CoV-2 antigen concentration was varied from 0.0001 to 0.001 nM. This was perhaps because of the less amount of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in these lower concentrated solutions to fix onto the coated CR3022 antibody.\n",
            " On the other hand, for high SARS-CoV-2 concentrations (0.01 and 10 nM), the SPR angles changed to a significant extent. The change was due to the increase in SARS-CoV-2 antigens that were being adsorbed on the antibody surface. Thus, it accordingly enlarged the change in the SPR angle. A similar type of finding was also reported in Fen et al. (2011) .\n",
            " The change in the SPR angle (θSPR) was calculated by subtracting the SPR angle of the target solution from that of the reference PBS solution (77.28 ○ ). The change in the SPR angle is mainly dependent on the bindings of the CR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 antigens. More specifically, the greater the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 antigens to the CR3022 antibody surface, the greater the change in the SPR angle that can be observed. The shift in the SPR angle slightly increased due to the molar concentration increase in the SARS-CoV-2 antigen solution up to 0.001 nM. The variation in the SPR angle was observed in a range from 0.08 ○ to 0.21 ○ for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen concentration of 0.0001 to 0.001 nM. This outcome can be recognized by the additional immobilization between the target sample and the ligand, and this led to an increase in the RI of the detecting layer. This outcome is in line with Shankaran et al. (2005) , who found that the increase in the SPR angle is the consequence of the developing bond of the antigen-antibody reaction. However, for the concentration of 100 nM, the SPR angle shift decreased compared to that of the previous concentrations. Due to the high concentration of the antigen, the antibody coated surface was entirely shielded and became congested (Omar et al., 2018) .\n",
            " Finally, the modification of the RI due to the variation in different concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein solution was also checked and is plotted in Fig. 4(c) . This linear relationship (R 2 = 0.9544) further justifies the value of the proposed sensor for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a highly sensitive manner as a similar nature of the relation was found for an SPR aptasensor to detect AIV H5N1 (Bai et al., 2012) .\n",
            " The concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein solution was varied between 0.0000 and 10 nM, and related SPR angle shift is depicted in Table III . Analysis shows that a linear relationship exists between the concentration and SPR angle changes, which is a desired characteristic for a sensor (Omar et al., 2018) .\n",
            " Similar linear trends were also found for the SPR angle shift and cumulative shift of the resonance angle against the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein solution's concentration, as listed in Table III . This further ensures a positive characteristic of the proposed sensor (Omar et al., 2020) .\n",
            " In summary, the proposed sensor's sensitivity was found to be 13.40%, 11.34%, and 1.03% higher than the sensor structure with silver only, silver-graphene, and silver-MoSe 2 -graphene, respectively. In terms of the quality factor, the new sensor achieved about 40.9%, 43.16%, and 35.75% higher quality factor compared to the silver only, silver-graphene, and silver-MoSe 2 -graphene structures, respectively. Similarly, the detection accuracy was also found to be higher than that of the others.\n",
            " A theoretical design of a multi-layered surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor is proposed for virus detection. Compared with other available sensors, which are predominantly singlelayered or optical fiber-based, this multilayered structure offers improved performance. For instance, the proposed sensor has a sensitivity of 194 ○ RIU −1 , a quality factor of 54.04 RIU −1 , and a detection accuracy of about 0.2702. Therefore, this proposed sensor\n",

            "Body Text: that small molecules produced by human-associated bacteria can affect not only host cells but also coinhabiting organisms of the microbiome (5, 6) . While many studies have focused on identifying microbiota-encoded metabolites that affect either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells, there are comparatively few examples of commensal metabolites that affect viral infection of host cells (7, 8) . Given that bacteria populate body sites that are frequently exposed to viruses, we sought to determine whether commensal bacteria encode metabolites that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",
            " Culture broth extracts from 50 phylogenetically diverse and commonly seen commensal bacteria were screened in a cell-based assay for the ability to inhibit infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2. Bioassay-guided fractionation and structure elucidation of the antiviral activities detected in this extract library led to our identification of three metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. These include the adenosine analogue N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)adenosine (IPA), the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HTR) agonist tryptamine, and the pyrazine 2,5-bis(3-indolylmethyl)pyrazine (BIP). Interestingly, there are clear structural and functional parallels between commensal bacteria-encoded and synthetic anti-SARS-CoV-2 active small molecules, as synthetic nucleosides, 5-HTR signaling modulators, and pyrazines have all been examined in either COVID-19 clinical trials or observational studies (e.g., remdesivir, fluvoxamine, and favipiravir, respectively) (9) (10) (11) . The identification of multiple commensal bacteria-encoded metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in this study suggests that the human microbiota likely represents an underexplored reservoir of antiviral small molecules.\n",
            " Creation and screening of a microbiome metabolite library. Although the human microbiome is composed of thousands of unique strains, metabolic redundancy across related bacteria suggests that examining a phylogenetically diverse subset of commensal bacteria is likely to uncover many of the common biologically active molecules that are produced by the microbiota (12) . For this study, we selected 50 strains cultured from body sites most likely to come in contact with viruses (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and skin) and distributed across the major phyla present in the human microbiome (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria). We sampled species from genera that are highly represented (e.g., Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides), as well as from those with only a small number of commensal species (e.g., Megasphaera, Coprobacillus), which allowed us to expand the phylogenetic diversity of our collection. Each strain was grown as a monoculture under the appropriate oxygen environment. After incubating at 37°C for 7 days, extracellular metabolites from these cultures were collected on Amberlite XAD7HP polymeric adsorbent. Resin-bound metabolites were then eluted to yield a library of crude bacterial extracts associated with a diverse collection of human-associated bacteria. In order to facilitate bioactive small-molecule discovery, we performed a prefractionation procedure on each extract in which the crude sample was partitioned by reverse-phase chromatography into 4 subfractions of increasing hydrophobicity (Fig. 1a) . The resulting extract fractions were tested at concentrations equivalent to a 25-fold (high) and an 8-fold (low) culture broth concentrate in an in vitro cell-based SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) infection assay.\n",
            " At the higher testing concentration (a 25-fold concentrate of culture broth), 10 bacteria produced at least 1 fraction that reduced viral infection to less than 10% (Fig. 1b) . To determine which of these activities were the result of individual antiviral metabolites instead of nonspecific inhibition due to the complex mixture of metabolites in the extract, each fraction that showed .90% inhibition was further partitioned by C-18 semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the resulting fractions were subject to another round of antiviral screening. Extracts from cultures of 4 bacteria (Ruminococcus gnavus, Prevotella nigrescens, Bacteroides caccae, and Micrococcus luteus) generated discrete antiviral-active HPLC fractions, from which individual anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolite(s) were purified and structurally characterized (Fig. 1b) .\n",
            " Characterization of microbiome-encoded SARS-CoV-2 active antivirals. (i) SARS-CoV-2 active pyrazines. Partitioning of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 active fraction from a culture of M. luteus SK58 that was isolated from a human skin sample (Human Microbiome Project [HMP] ID 569) (13) revealed a major antiviral active compound and a second HPLC peak with a similar UV trace but only minimal anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Structural elucidation of these two compounds by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) indicated that the FIG 1 Screening of human-associated bacteria for the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolites. (a) Schematic for the construction of a fractionated culture broth extract library and antiviral screening. (b, i) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of fractionated culture broth extracts from 50 humanassociated bacteria. n = 3. (b, ii and iii) Antiviral active metabolites were isolated from column fractions that showed reproducible antiviral activity. n = 3. (b, iv) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and cytotoxicity of each purified metabolite in Huh-7.5 cells. n = 3; data are mean 6 SD. primary antiviral compound was 2,5-bis(3-indolylmethyl)pyrazine (BIP) (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), and the second compound was 2-(3-indolylmethyl)-5-methylpyrazine (IMP) (Fig. S2 and S9C ). To confirm these structures, BIP and IMP standards were synthesized from a-amino aldehydes using existing methods for producing pyrazine alkaloids (14) . Based on NMR and HR-MS, the synthetic and natural materials were spectroscopically identical ( Fig. S3 and S4 ). In dose-response testing against SARS-COV-2 infection of Huh-7.5 cells, purified BIP had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 70 mM (Fig. 1b) , while IMP displayed much weaker antiviral activity (IC 50 . 250 mM) (Fig. S5 ). Neither compound displayed significant cytotoxicity (CC 50 . 250 mM).\n",
            " (ii) SARS-CoV-2 active tryptamine. NMR and HR-MS data indicated that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolite produced by R. gnavus CC55_001C that was isolated from a colonic biopsy specimen (HMP ID 1201) (13) was tryptamine (Fig. S6 ). Its identity and activity were confirmed using a commercial tryptamine standard. R. gnavus is a well-established producer of tryptamine through the decarboxylation of tryptophan, a reaction that cannot be carried out by the human host (15) . It is a member of the microbiota of most children and adults and overrepresented in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (16) .\n",
            " In dose-response testing against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Huh-7.5 cells, tryptamine had an IC 50 of 33 mM (Fig. 1b) , with some loss in cell viability observed at the highest concentration tested (250 mM). Tryptamine is found in human feces at concentrations generally ranging from 10 to 25 mM and as high as 50 mM in some individuals (17) , making its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection within this same concentration range intriguing. Tryptamine is a potent agonist of a number of serotonin G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (5-hydroxytryptamine receptors ) and is especially active against HTR2C and HTR5A (50% effective concentration [EC 50 ], 70 nM) (5). Although we do not know whether the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of tryptamine was due to its 5-HTR agonism, a number of synthetic 5-HTR modulators have been reported to exert antiviral activity against other viruses. For example, the 5-HTR agonist 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT) reduces reovirus entry in vitro (18) , while the 5-HTR antagonist methiothepin mesylate (MM) was reported to inhibit Chikungunya virus replication (19) . To explore the relevance of 5-HTRs modulators to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assayed MM and 5-NT for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Both MM (IC 50 , 2.8 mM) and 5-NT (IC 50 , 70 mM) exhibited antiviral activity (Fig. 2) , illustrating that either agonism or antagonism of 5-HTR receptors can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. (iii) SARS-CoV-2 active N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)adenosine. Fractions from extracts of P. nigrescens CC14M that was identified in colonic biopsy specimen (HMP ID 1173) (13) and B. caccae CL03T12C61 cultured from a human fecal sample (HMP ID 1061) (13) yielded SARS-CoV-2 active metabolites with identical HPLC retention times, UV spectra, and masses (m/z = 336.1672). Structural elucidation by NMR and HR-MS identified these metabolites as the N 6 -modified adenosine derivative N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)adenosine (IPA) (Fig. S7) . Comparison of the natural compound to a commercial standard confirmed IPA as the active metabolite produced by both bacteria. Purified IPA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of Huh-7.5 cells with an IC 50 of 2 mM (Fig. 1b) , which is as potent or more potent than a number of repurposed drugs that have been explored as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, IC 50 , 2 mM; ribavirin, IC 50 , 30 mM; and favipiravir, IC 50 . 100 mM). Notably, IPA also displayed cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 ], 12 mM), something that is often observed with antiviral nucleoside analogues (20) .\n",
            " As IPA was the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolite we identified, we sought to probe its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in more detail. A common mode of action of nucleoside-based antivirals is incorporation into the product RNA strand by viral RNAdependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) (21, 22) . We, therefore, hypothesized that IPA might be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Nucleoside antivirals are prodrugs that must first be phosphorylated in vivo in order to function as RdRp substrates (23) . The ability of mammalian cells to phosphorylate IPA was examined by incubating HEK293 cells with IPA (10 mM, 3 h) and monitoring the intracellular concentration of the nucleoside and its phosphorylated derivative using negative ionization HR-MS. Similar to the control nucleoside antiviral remdesivir, we observed the appearance of IPA 59-monophosphate (p-IPA) in IPA-treated cells (Fig. 3a) , indicating that IPA, like other nucleoside antivirals, is phosphorylated by eukaryotic cells.\n",
            " Remdesivir, which is approved for the treatment of severe COVID-19, is efficiently incorporated as an ATP analog into the product RNA strand during SARS-CoV-2 RdRpcatalyzed RNA synthesis (24) . The resulting product RNA can then serve as the template strand, which, at intracellular nucleoside concentrations, leads to template-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (25) . To test if the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp can incorporate IPA into the product RNA strand, we synthetically triphosphorylated IPA to yield N 6 -(D 2 -isopentenyl)ATP (ppp-IPA) (26) . In vitro RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp from a template RNA strand (27) (Fig. 3b ) was then used to assess the enzyme's ability to incorporate ppp-IPA. The corresponding triphosphate of remdesivir (ppp-RDV) was used as a positive control. In this assay, the addition of UTP to begin RNA synthesis of a \"AAUUUUAG. . .\"-containing template strand resulted in the formation of the 12 product (Fig. 3c, lane 2 ). Further addition of ATP formed the 17 product (Fig. 3c, lane 3) . Addition of the RNA chain terminator 39-dATP (dATP) forms a 13 product, though the full 17 product could be recovered by the simultaneous addition of ATP (Fig. 3c , lanes 4 to 5). Addition of either ppp-IPA or ppp-RDV resulted in the formation of the 17 RNA product whether ATP was present or not, confirming that ppp-IPA, like ppp-RDV (24), is successfully incorporated into the growing RNA product as an ATP analog by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (Fig. 3c , lanes 6 to 9; Fig. S8 ). IPA may have other targets beyond the viral RdRp. Certain N 6 -modified nucleosides, for example, can interfere with canonical base pairing (28) . This provides an alternate mechanism for viral inhibition, with a buildup of mutations resulting in lethal mutagenesis, as seen with other nucleoside antivirals such as ribavirin (29) . Mutagenesis as a result of base pair mismatching could also help explain the cytotoxicity exhibited by IPA. Additionally, although nucleoside antivirals are best known for being incorporated by RNA polymerase, other targets, such as RNA capping enzymes, exist (30) and cannot be ruled out as possible targets of IPA. While the incorporation of IPA during SARS-CoV-2-mediated RNA synthesis does not preclude the possibility that it may be imparting antiviral activity through other pathways, it is nonetheless interesting that the naturally occurring nucleoside antiviral IPA can, like the clinically used antiviral remdesivir, be readily incorporated during RNA synthesis.\n",
            " Structure-activity relationship of microbiome-derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolites. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of each anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolite was explored using collections of naturally occurring related structures. For IPA, we tested adenine and adenosine, as well as several N-modified adenine and adenosine derivatives (Fig. S9a) . None of these, including the closely related trans-zeatin riboside, displayed antiviral activity (IC 50 . 250 mM) ( Table 1) . Although diverse nucleoside structures are used as antivirals, IPA appears to have unique anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity among closely related, naturally occurring nucleosides. We explored the SAR of tryptamine's anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity using a panel of natural tryptamine analogs, as well as the structurally related trace amines tyramine and phenylethylamine, all of which are known bacterial metabolites (Fig. S9b ) (31) (32) (33) . While both natural (e.g., bufotenine) and synthetic (e.g., 5-NT) tryptamine derivatives have been reported to have antiviral activity (18, 34, 35) , among the closely related bacterial metabolites we tested, tryptamine was uniquely active against SARS-CoV-2. 2,5-Disubstituted pyrazines arise from the coupling of two amino acids (36) , and thus, the production of a large number of disubstituted pyrazines is possible from proteinogenic amino acids. As the anti-SARS-CoV-2 active pyrazine BIP contained two indole groups, we focused our SAR analysis on testing the relevance of indole to antiviral activity. To do this, we synthesized the phenylalanine-derived analogs of BIP and IMP, 2,5-bis(phenylmethyl)pyrazine (BPP) and 2-(phenylmethyl)-5-methylpyrazine (PMP), and assayed them for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Neither was active in the concentration range we tested (Table 1 ; Fig. S9c ). Once again, the naturally occurring compound we isolated was the most active among the closely related structures we tested.\n",
            " Activity against other viruses. We tested all three microbiome-derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 active metabolites for activity against a panel of RNA viruses, including the seasonal coronavirus HCoV-229E, yellow fever virus 17D (YFV 17D), and human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV-3). These are representative of both positive-sense single-strand RNA (1ssRNA) viruses (HCoV-229E, YFV 17D) and negative-sense single-strand RNA (2ssRNA) viruses (hPIV-3). As with SARS-CoV-2, all viral infections were carried out using Huh-7.5 cells.\n",
            " IPA displayed broad antiviral activity (IC 50 , 2 to 13 mM). It was most potent against the three 1ssRNA viruses (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, and YFV 17D) with roughly the same IC 50 (2 mM to 4 mM) against each (Fig. 4a) . Although less potent, it also inhibited infection by the lone 2ssRNA virus we tested, hPIV-3 (IC 50 , 13 mM). Tryptamine showed a narrower spectrum of activity (Fig. 4b) . It was most active against the two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 (IC 50 , 33 mM) and HCoV-229E (IC 50 , 50 mM), and less effective against the 2ssRNA virus hPIV-3 (IC 50 218 mM). Despite also being a 1ssRNA virus, tryptamine was almost five times less active against YFV 17D (IC 50 , 158 mM) than it was against SARS-CoV-2. Like IPA, BIP displayed similar antiviral activity against the three 1ssRNA viruses, with IC 50 s of 12, 20, and 70 mM against HCoV-229E, YFV 17D, and SARS-CoV-2, respectively (Fig. 4c) . It was inactive against the only 2ssRNA virus, hPIV-3. Among IPA, tryptamine, and BIP, tryptamine was unique in its ability to preferably inhibit coronavirus infections.\n",
            " Production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 metabolites by commensal strains and the human microbiome. Contrary to what has traditionally been seen in the search for bioactive small molecules from bacteria derived from other ecosystems (e.g., soil), IPA and tryptamine are not specialized metabolites that arise from complex and rare biosynthetic gene clusters. Similar to many of the bioactive molecules that have been characterized from the human microbiota (37, 38), these metabolites instead arise from primary metabolic and catabolic pathways. To look for production of antiviral metabolites by other commensal bacteria, we used HR-MS to track the presence of these metabolites in the 50 culture broth extracts we originally screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity ( Fig. 5 ; Table S1 ). In the case of IPA, in addition to the two strains from which it was originally characterized, it was also produced in a high titer by Bacteroides fragilis CL07T00C01. IPA was produced at a detectable level most frequently by strains from the Bacteroidetes phylum, with half of the Bacteroidetes strains we examined producing IPA. The frequent production of IPA by Bacteroidetes strains was surprising given that previous reports of bacteria producing high levels IPA, other than as a tRNA constituent, are quite rare (39) . Tryptamine is a commonly identified metabolite in human fecal samples (17) . Among the strains we examined, it was produced in the highest titer by R. gnavus but was also detected at lower levels in extracts from a number of other bacteria ( Fig. 5) . Although taxonomically diverse bacteria, including Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes (36, 40, 41) , have been reported to produce smaller pyrazine-based natural products, and contrary to IPA and tryptamine, which are produced by a number of bacteria in our collection, BIP and IMP were only produced at detectable levels by M. luteus. While tryptamine is ubiquitous in human stool samples, the production of IPA, BIP, and IMP by the human microbiome is not well described. To probe for the in vivo production of these metabolites, we looked for tandem mass spectra matching IPA, BIP, or IMP in metabolite extract data from fecal and tissue samples submitted to the GNPS, an open-access metabolomics repository (42) . In a number of fecal and tissue samples collected from both mice and humans, we identified tandem mass spectra matching IPA. The detection of IPA in these samples suggests that its production by microbiome-derived bacteria in the laboratory was not merely a by-product of in vitro fermentation methods. One human fecal data set was found to contain a spectral match to BIP and IMP. The rarity of these metabolites in stool samples may be explained by a lack of bacterial producers that are native to the gut. Among the strains we examined, the only producing strain, M. luteus, is not found in the gut but, rather, is an aerobic bacterium commonly observed in the skin microbiome (43) .\n",
            " In our survey of culture broth extracts from bacteria isolated from human samples, we identified three structurally diverse metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Of the metabolites we identified, IPA displayed the most potent antiviral activity, and tryptamine, while less potent, was effective in the concentration range commonly seen in the human gut. All three metabolites are either structurally and/or functionally related to synthetic FDA-approved drugs that have been tested in either COVID-19 clinical trials or observational studies (Fig. 6 ). IPA is a constituent of bacterial tRNA (39), and very low titers of IPA (4 to 12 mg/liter) have been observed in cultures of a small number of bacterial plant symbiotes (44, 45) . Interestingly, P. nigrescens produces more than 500 mg/liter of IPA. Free IPA is best known as a plant cytokinin (46) and has been reported to inhibit enterovirus 71 (EV-71) infection in cell culture (47) ; however, to the best of our knowledge, neither the production of IPA by human commensal bacteria nor its activity toward SARS-CoV-2 was known.\n",
            " Tryptamine is a known bacterial agonist of the 5-HTR family of GPCRs. In a smallscale randomized clinical trial, fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is typically used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, was associated with improved COVID-19 outcomes (9). In addition, in a retrospective study of patients taking antipsychotic and antidepressant serotonin 2A receptor antagonists (e.g., trazadone, mirtazapine), taking these drugs was associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 infections (48) . While the mechanisms that explain these observations remain to be determined, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity observed for modulators of 5- HTR signaling suggests that it will be interesting to explore the potential antiviral effects of modulating this signaling pathway through engineering of the microbiome.\n",
            " BIP is a pyrazine-based antiviral produced only by M. luteus among the strains we examined. Small pyrazines like 2,5-dimethylpyrazine have been reported to have antifungal activity, while the larger, indole-containing BIP has been reported to be inactive as an antimicrobial (40, 49) . The biosynthesis of small pyrazines is relatively common in nature (50) , and opportunistic human pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and Serratia marcescens have been reported to produce small pyrazines as potential signaling molecules (51, 52) . Indole-bearing pyrazines have only been observed a few times in nature (40) . In one case, both BIP and IMP were reported as products of a Brevibacillus laterosporus strain that was cultured from the ear of a feral hog (41) . The identification of BIP and IMP from M. luteus, a commonly observed human skin commensal, is, to our knowledge, both the first example of indole-containing pyrazines being produced by a human microbiome-derived bacterium and the first report of BIP having antiviral activity. As these metabolites have not been previously reported from the human microbiome, we do not know if they ever accumulate at significant quantities physiologically.\n",
            " Any potential ecological role of these metabolites in a complex host, microbiome, and virus tripartite interaction remains to be determined. However, the similarity between commensal antiviral metabolites and FDA-approved antivirals is intriguing and unexpected. Our identification of metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity suggests that the human microbiota may encode a reservoir of small molecules with antiviral activity and that continued screening of commensal bacterial extracts should be a fruitful strategy for identifying additional antiviral small molecules.\n",
            " Chemicals, cell lines, and viral strains. IPA and tryptamine standards were obtained from Cayman Chemical and Alfa Aesar, respectively. All bacterial strains were obtained from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH, as part of the Human Microbiome Project (13) . Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells (Homo sapiens; sex, male; liver epithelial) (53) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Cells have been authenticated and tested negative for contamination with mycoplasma. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020; BEI Resources) and HCoV-229E were amplified and titrated by standard plaque assay (PA) in Huh-7.5 cells (54) . The generation of viral stocks for additional viruses has been previously described as follows: hPIV-3 (55) (based on strain JS) and YFV 17D Venus (56) (derived from YF17D-59C25Venus2AUbi).\n",
            " Bacterial fermentations. All bacteria were cultivated in LBM media (17 g/liter brain heart infusion, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 200 mg MgSO 4 Á7H 2 O, 100 mg/liter MnCl 2 Á4H 2 O, 5 mg/liter hemin, 1 g/liter maltose, 1 g/liter cellobiose, and 0.5 g/liter L-cysteine). Bacterial fermentations were performed aerobically or anaerobically for each individual strain. For aerobic fermentations, the bacterial glycerol stock provided by BEI was used to inoculate 10 ml of LBM. This culture was grown for 24 to 48 h at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm, and once, turbid was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh LBM media in a 3-liter baffled Fernbach flask. The culture was fermented for 7 days at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm, followed by metabolite extraction as described below. All anaerobic fermentations were performed in a 37°C incubator placed inside vinyl anaerobic chamber (Coy) with a gas mix of 5% CO 2 , 5% H 2 , and 90% N 2 . The bacterial glycerol stock provided by BEI was used to inoculate 10 ml of LBM. This culture was grown for 24 to 48 h, and once, turbid was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh LBM media in a 1-liter glass bottle (Chemglass). Fermentation proceeded anaerobically for 7 days at 37°C followed by metabolite extraction as described below.\n",
            " Small molecule extraction and prefractionation. Amberlite XAD7HP resin (Sigma) was activated by soaking in methanol for 15 min, followed by washing five times with deionized water. Resin was stored in water until needed. Twenty grams of activated Amberlite resin was added to 1 liter of a cell suspension of bacterial culture and incubated with shaking (200 rpm) at room temperature for 4 h. Resin was then collected by filtration. We added 300 ml of acetone (Sigma), and this mixture was shaken for 2 h at room temperature. The acetone elution was collected, and an equal volume of fresh acetone was added and allowed to incubate with the resin overnight at room temperature. This second acetone elution was combined with the first and dried in vacuo on a rotary evaporator (Buchi) to afford a crude metabolite extract.\n",
            " Each extract was resuspended in methanol (Sigma) to a concentration of 100 mg/ml. One milliliter (100 mg) of this solution was aliquoted and diluted in water to 5% methanol and spun down to prepare for fractionation on a Strata C 18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge (500 mg, 3 ml; Phenomenex). The SPE cartridge was activated with two column volumes of methanol followed by washing with two column volumes of water. The crude extract was then passed over the column, and the flowthrough (fraction F1) was collected. Metabolites were then eluted (two column volumes) using a stepwise gradient of increasing methanol concentrations as follows: F2, 30%; F3, 70%; and F4, 100%. These elutions, along with the column flowthrough, were dried in vacuo, affording four prefractionated extracts from each crude metabolite pool.\n",
            " SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. The day prior to infection, Huh-7.5 cells were seeded at 7.5 Â 10 3 cells/ well into 96-well plates. The next day, serially diluted compounds were added to the wells, followed 1 h later by infections with either SARS-CoV-2 (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 0.05 PFU/cell), HCoV-229E (MOI, 0.05 PFU/cell), YFV 17D Venus (MOI, 0.025 PFU/cell), or hPIV-3-GFP (MOI, 0.05 IU/cell). Cells were incubated for 48 h at 33°C for infections performed with SARS-CoV-2 and at 37°C for infections performed with other viruses. Cells were then fixed by adding an equal volume of 7% formaldehyde to the wells and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After extensive washing, SARS-CoV-2-and HCoV-229E-infected cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution of 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (catalog no. 005-000-121; Jackson ImmunoResearch). A rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (catalog no. GTX135357; GeneTex) was added to the cells at 1:1,000 dilution in blocking solution and incubated at 4°C overnight. J2, a mouse monoclonal anti-double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) antibody (catalog no. 10010500; Scicons) was added to the cells under similar conditions to detect HCoV-229E-infected cells. Goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (catalog no. A-11012; Life Technologies) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (catalog no. A-11001; Life Technologies) were used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:2,000. Nuclei for all infections, including those with the fluorescently labeled YFV 17D and hPIV-3, were stained with Hoechst 33342 (catalog no. 62249; Thermo Scientific) at 1 mg/ml. Next, images were acquired with an ImageXpress XLS Widefield High-Content microscope (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Images were acquired using the DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) filter (excitation, 377 nm, and emission, 447 nm) for Hoechst staining and the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter (excitation, 482 nm, and emission, 536 nm) for viral nucleocapsid staining. Images were analyzed using an automated custom module in the MetaXpress software (Molecular Devices). Default software analysis scripts were used for DAPI-and FITC-positive cell counting. Infection was calculated as the percentage of viable cells that were positive for viral nucleocapsid. For determining the efficacy of isolated metabolites, 10-point doseresponse curves in a 1:3 dilution series were tested in triplicate using a maximum concentration of 50 mM (IPA) or 250 mM (tryptamine, BIP, and IMP). IC 50 values were calculated using a variable-slope, four-parameter nonlinear regression curve fit (GraphPad Prism 8). All SARS-CoV-2 experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.\n",

            "Title: Unmasking the information encoded as structural motifs of viral RNA genomes: a potential antiviral target\n",
            "Body Text: The appearance of viral mutants resistant to antiviral compounds is a major public health concern. The continuous generation of such mutants is a characteristic of RNA viruses, many of which, for example, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and DENV (all with a single-stranded, positive RNA genome), cause serious diseases. The genome of RNA viruses acts both as a template for replication and as an mRNA. During replication, mutations are introduced into the genome via errors in the action of viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase; this can generate mutants that may greatly contribute to viral proliferation-although it can also lead to the disappearance of the virus if such changes leave it non-viable or induce acute pathogenesis in the host, the so-called error catastrophe (for reviews, see [1, 2] ). Viruses must, therefore, strive to reach an equilibrium that allows for adaptive fitness without compromising their persistence. To accomplish this, RNA viruses have developed an information storage system that does not code for proteins, but for specific, complex and highly conserved, folded genomic regions that play direct, functional roles in the viral cycle. These viral regions present an adaptive behaviour that has evolved with the selective pressure to achieve high genetic robustness [3] [4] [5] . As a result, mutations in viral RNA genomes present minor incidence in the functional elements [4] .\n",
            " RNA molecules show two levels of compaction: their secondary and their tertiary structures. The secondary structure is the result of double-stranded and single-stranded regions arrangements, for example, helices closed by loops. The tertiary structure is determined by the relationships established between secondary structure elements.\n",
            " The combination of these two folding levels establishes the final shape of the RNA molecules, the so-called RNA structurome [6] . This conformational view has prompted the search of structured RNA motifs as FRDs, not only in the viral genomes [7] but also in the transcriptome of all living organisms (for a review, see [6] ).\n",
            " A main feature of FRDs included in viral genomes is their high genetic robustness, likely derived from their essentiality for the consecution of the infective cycle [3] [4] [5] . FRDs are cis-acting elements typically involved in RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions, required for the correct execution and regulation of essential viral processes [8] [9] [10] . One of the FRDs that have attracted the most attention is the IRES. IRES regions direct the recruitment of the cellular translation machinery in a cap-independent manner [11] . Similarly, viral replication and maturation are regulated by the direct binding of viral polymerases and related cofactors to FRDs in the 3′ end of the genomic RNA, as well as by direct RNA-RNA interactions between distant regions of the virus genome [12] .\n",
            " The functional importance of structural elements in the viral cycle and their high conservation rate [8, 9, [13] [14] [15] suggest that they might make good therapeutic targets, and the idea of developing novel antiviral tools (mostly RNA based) to attack them has gained currency in recent years. This review briefly summarises what is known about the FRDs of a number of viruses, paying special attention to those infecting humans, and recapitulates the state of the art in the development of therapeutic compounds that might interfere with FRD folding and, therefore, function.\n",
            " VIRAL IRESS: RNA TAGS FOR EFFICIENT TRANSLATION Many viral genomes achieve efficient translation initiation by the use of IRESs, which replace IFs by the combined use of several FRDs. These regions present high sequence and structural diversity across different viral groups, which define the mechanisms by which they promote translation. IRESs are therefore divided into four groups [16] according to common IF requirements ( Figure 1 ):\n",
            " -Packed IRESs. This group encompasses the IRES elements located in the IGR of the genome of the Dicistroviridae family (whose members infect insects). The folding of these elements represents a highly conserved, compact structure that, via the so-called all-RNA-based mechanism, mediates the recruitment of the ribosome with no need of additional protein factors [17] . The IRES structure can be split into three domains (Figure 1 (a)), each defined by a PK motif (PKI-PKIII). This conformation is considered the 'prefolded' isoform of the IRES. Domain PKIII mimics the folding of the initiator transfer RNA (tRNA), allowing it to occupy the P and E sites of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This promotes structural changes in the IRES that finally allow the binding of the 60S particle and the efficient initiation of translation from a non-AUG codon [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Thus, the conformation of PKIII replaces the need for an initiator tRNA [23]. -Extended IRES with compact regions. The prototype of this group, the HCV IRES, folds as an extended region with tightly compact domains. It is mostly contained in the 5′UTR of the RNA genome but also spans a short stretch of the coding sequence ( Figure 1(b It is tempting to propose that the induction of the IRES within the coding sequence is further modulated by long-distance RNA-RNA interactions with the 5′UTR, thus promoting alternative conformations that might regulate its functioning [46] .\n",
            " FRDs are needed in the 3′ end of viral genomes to promote the efficient binding of the polymerase and the regulation of the elongation step during RNA synthesis [7, 12] . They are also important partners in the preservation of viral genomic stability and the control of processes mediated by the 5′ end [47] . The latter is mediated by the establishment of a dynamic crosstalk between both termini of the genomic RNA. The sequence and 3D structure of the 3′ cis-acting domains are quite diverse, even among members of the same taxon ( Figure 2 ), which must entail substantial differences in the mechanism of action if the same function is to be achieved. Such great complexity and variability preclude a detailed discussion of all the 3′ RNA structures present in different RNA viruses; only those most extensively studied are therefore mentioned in the following. The genus Enterovirus includes human polioviruses, rhinoviruses and the human enteroviruses of groups B, C and D (which include different human coxsackieviruses). Their genomic RNA ends with the so-called oriR region, which is composed of a short, highly folded 3′UTR (75-100 nucleotides) capped by a polyA tail [48, 49] . The oriR has been shown to play an important role in viral replication via its direct recruitment of viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase and host cell factors such as PCBP, the La autoantigen and eEF1A [15] . A common architecture at the 3′UTR can be inferred for all the members of the same viral group (Figure 2 (a)). Thus, rhinoviruses have a single stem-loop (named Y), polioviruses contain two stem-loops (X and Y) and coxsackieviruses have three consecutive stem-loops (X, Y and Z) [48] . The presence of two or more stem-loops defines a typical PK motif involving the apical loops of domains X and Y [50,51]. This PK may regulate dynamic spatial rearrangements in domains X and Y that fine-tune viral RNA synthesis [52,53]. Despite sequence diversity, enterovirus 3′UTR represents a good example of how RNA genome structure has diversified yet retains common essential functions.\n",
            " -Aphthoviruses:\n",
            " FMDV is the prototype of the aphthovirus group. Its genome contains an essential oriR region at the 3′ end consisting of a well-defined 3′UTR of around 90 nucleotides, plus a genetically encoded polyA tract (Figure 2 (b)). The 3′UTR adopts a quasi-globular conformation defined by two stemloops, SL1 and SL2. It was recently shown that, whereas the deletion of SL2 completely interferes with virus viability, mutants defective for SL1 only show reduced replication capacity [54] . The oriR region in aphthoviruses is also involved in translational control by the establishment of molecular bridges with the IRES element at the 5′ end of the viral genome [55].\n",
            " cis-Acting elements within the 3′ end of genomic Flaviviridae RNA -Hepacivirus sp.:\n",
            " The 3′UTR of the HCV genome is an evolutionarily conserved structural element of around 200 nucleotides with three different domains ( Figure 2 (c)): the HV, a polyU/UC tract of variable length and composition and the 3′X tail consisting of three stem-loops (3′SLI-3′SLIII) [56, 57] . Both the polyU/UC tract and the 3′X tail contain elements important in replication and infectivity in cell culture and a chimpanzee model [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . The 3′UTR in hepaciviruses operates by the recruitment of viral proteins, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase [65] , as well as numerous host factors [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . Moreover, the formation of high-order structures involving RNA motifs in the 3′ end of the coding sequence provides additional regulation of 3′ UTR folding and activity [71, 72] . Together, the aforementioned elements constitute the complete functional scaffold required to achieve precise RNA replication.\n",
            " -Flavivirus sp.:\n",
            " This genus includes important human pathogens, such as DENV, YFV and JEV. Their positive RNA genome contains a 3′UTR ranging from 350 to 700 nucleotides in length. Despite this heterogeneity in size, common secondary structure elements are found at the very 3′ end of the genomic RNA, defining the so-called domain III, which is indispensable for replication [73] (Figure 2 (d)). Domain III is composed of a short hairpin followed by a long and stable stem-loop (3′SL). It has been shown that the formation of a PK motif involving the apical loop of the short hairpin and an internal loop of the 3′SL is critical for the recognition of viral and cellular proteins during the initiation of RNA synthesis [74] .\n",
            " The genome of the Coronaviridae family encodes for five to seven overlapping, capped and polyadenylated subgenomic mRNAs [75] . The 3′UTR contains two highly conserved structural motifs: an essential bulged stem-loop (BSL) immediately followed by a hairpin (Figure 2 (e)) [76, 77] . Under certain conditions, this folding may be displaced towards the formation of a PK motif between the base of the first domain and the apical loop of the hairpin [78] . This leads to a conformational equilibrium that must be preserved for RNA replication to occur. At the 3′ position of the PK, an HVR is found. It is highly divergent in terms of both primary and secondary structures, with the exception of the 5′-GGAAGAGG-3′ motif. This octanucleotide is situated 70-80 nucleotides from the 3′ end of all coronavirus genomes, thus being considered a characteristic signature of these pathogenic agents [75] . Such stringent conservation implies a critical yet unknown function in the coronavirus biology [79] .\n",
            " There is a long list of viral and cellular proteins that also bind the 3′UTR of different coronavirus and affect replication [75] . These include viral RNA polymerase, non-structural virus proteins, nuclear factors and proteins involved in the translation process. Thus, once again, RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions provide a complex regulatory network that controls viral infection.\n",
            " Recent work has shown a great variety of cis-acting RNA motifs embedded throughout the coding sequence [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . These operate in a coordinated fashion with other functional regions and with viral and host proteins, providing complex control systems for replication.\n",
            " Some of the best-characterised CREs are found in the picornavirus genome [87] [88] [89] . All of them contain one or more short hairpins responsible for efficient priming during RNA synthesis [90] . Two adenine residues placed in an apical loop of one of these hairpins function as a template for the uridylylation of the essential viral protein VPg, involved in picornaviral replication [90] . This mechanism has been shown to contribute to the overcoming of the rate-limiting effects of low nucleotide concentrations [91] , thus providing a robust system for the initiation of replication.\n",
            " A CRE was identified within the 3′ end of the coding sequence of the HCV genome [81] . It is a highly conserved structure composed of three stem-loops (5BSL3.1-5BSL3.3) (Figure 3 (a)) [92] , which were shown to be required for viral replication [64, 93] . The establishment of long-range RNA-RNA interactions between 5BSL3.2 and the 3′SLII within the 3′UTR [71, [94] [95] [96] , and with the SL9110 hairpin motif in the coding sequence [72, 95, 96] , is critical for the proper functioning of this region during viral RNA synthesis (Figure 3 (a)) [71, 72] . Importantly, the existence of an additional, direct, long-range RNA-RNA interaction involving the subdomain IIId of the IRES and the essential stem-loop 5BSL3.2 of the CRE region has important consequences for the regulation of the HCV IRES function (Figure 3(a) ) [96] [97] [98] .\n",
            " End-to-end communication in viral genomes is directly responsible for promoting and regulating different steps of the infectious cycle. Via the establishment of long-distance contacts, differentially evolved functional regions at both ends of viral genomes can act in a coordinated fashion to generate molecular switch control systems between different steps of the viral cycle. Such crosstalk seems to provide important benefits, such as an increase in the local concentration of essential proteins and cofactors and additional protection against the action of exonucleases. Genome circularisation provides new proof of the great versatility shown by compact viral RNA genomes.\n",
            " The formation of the circular topology in picornaviruses is dependent on direct RNA contacts between the IRES and the 3′UTR (Figure 3 (b)) [55]. Furthermore, the RNA binding capacity of different factors, such as eIF4G to the IRES region or PABP to the 3′ polyA tail, ensures the stability of the closed-loop conformation.\n",
            " In hepacivirus genomes, circularisation was initially proposed to be mediated by protein factors alone [47] , which would simultaneously bind to both ends of the viral genome. More recently, a long-range contact between the IRES and the CRE was described to induce significant conformational changes in precise domains of the IRES (Figure 3 (a)) [97, 99] , resulting in the regulation of the IRES function [98] . Undoubtedly, these results do not exclude the participation of viral and cellular proteins in the stabilisation of circular topology, nor the performance of important functional roles [100] [101] [102] [103] .\n",
            " In other viruses, such as Flavivirus sp., RNA genome circularisation does not require the presence of proteins but the use of canonical and complementary sequences (cyclisation sequence, upstream AUG region and downstream AUG region) at either end of the viral genome [104] [105] [106] (Figure 3(c) ). These motifs achieve the association of the genomic termini by direct base pairing. The closed-loop topology is essential for viral propagation and could be very advantageous for the regulation of viral translation and RNA synthesis, as well for the control of the switch between different steps of the viral cycle.\n",

Circularisation mechanisms in different viral genomic RNA molecules. Detailed diagrams of the secondary structure proposed for the 5′ and 3′ ends, as well as for the described cis-acting replicating elements (CREs), are shown. (a) Hepatitis C virus. The region required for internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity is noted.

(b) Foot and mouth disease virus RNA genome with the VPg viral protein bound to its 5′ end. The IRES region is indicated. Binding sites for eIF4G and polyA binding protein (PABP) are shadowed.

The black solid lines indicate long-distance interactions (direct RNA-RNA and protein-protein contacts). Arrows denote the position of the start and stop translation codons. Pseudoknots (PK) are noted as described in Figure 1 tools. The constant appearance of sequence mutants resistant to current treatments has prompted the search for alternative targets. Structurally conserved regions involved in the progression of the viral cycle are excellent candidates. The combination of different compounds targeting multiple viral regions and processes might contribute greatly to reducing the appearance of resistant variants. The following section summarises the main advances recently made in the development of molecules directed against different functional domains of viral RNA genomes.\n",
            " Nucleic acids, particularly RNA, are excellent candidates for the development of antiviral agents targeting functional regions of viral genomes. The success of these strategies relies on sequence complementarity and/or structural recognition between the inhibitor and the target. Therefore, highly conserved genomic domains are the most promising regions for targeting new nucleicacid-based antiviral compounds. Importantly, a number of aspects need to be taken into account in pursuing this goal [107] , such as the cellular uptake of the inhibitor, target and inhibitor colocalisation, the active inhibitor concentration inside the cell, the intracellular inhibitor stability and the access and binding to the target region. In recent years, great progress has been made in the field of nucleic acid treatment, and some of the aforementioned problems have been now successfully solved. This has led to the design of new generations of antiviral RNA and DNA drugs that are currently being extensively developed [108] .\n",
            " -Antisense oligonucleotides:\n",
            " Antisense oligonucleotides are short nucleic acid molecules whose sequence is complementary to an existing motif in a target RNA. The molecular mechanisms of action of antisense oligonucleotides are diverse (Figure 4(a) ) [109] . They act by hiding essential sites in the viral genomic RNA, such as those required for protein synthesis, replication and packaging, or if DNA based, by inducing target degradation mediated by RNase H [108] .\n",
            " Antisense oligonucleotides can be administered either directly, by subcutaneous injection or as pharmacological compositions. In this context, great advances in the combinatorial chemistry have allowed for the development of oligonucleotides with chemical substitutions at precise positions [108] . These modifications confer important features, such as significant half-life increase in serum and higher thermal stability of the duplex [110] . A different administration strategy is based on the intracellular production of unmodified antisense oligonucleotides. It requires gene therapy protocols to deliver the construct inside the cell. Its main advantage is that chimeric constructs encompassing different antisense sequences (or even different nucleic-acid-based inhibitors) can be produced, thus targeting multiple sites simultaneously. The use of this strategy may greatly contribute in diminishing the appearance of resistant viral variants. This method has been successfully used for the inhibition of the HIV-1 replication [112] [113] [114] .\n",
            " -Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs):\n",
            " The cellular RNAi pathway can be triggered by synthetic double-stranded siRNA molecules. These compounds are usually 21 nucleotides long, with a two-nucleotide 3′ overhang. The siRNAs are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex, where the sense or guide strand is selected to target the complementary sequence within the genomic viral RNA for further degradation (Figure 4(a) ) [115] .\n",
            " To date, numerous studies have been conducted using siRNAs as antiviral drugs [115] . Importantly, previous advances made for the therapeutic use of antisense oligonucleotides have served as the starting point for the development of this new strategy. Thus, the incorporation of stabilising chemical modifications in the passenger (antisense) strand may greatly increase the potency of the siRNA without toxicity [116] .\n",
            " The application of gene therapy strategies to promote a long-term decrease of viral loads has been also studied for the siRNA technology. One of the main drawbacks of this alternative is the appearance of escape mutants [117] . To overcome this problem, several strategies have been developed from the generation of constructs combining multiple siRNAs targeting different regions of the viral genomes [118] .\n",
            " The great potential of siRNA-based therapeutics has prompted the development of novel internalisation strategies that should allow for a better-sustained antiviral response. Important contributions have been made in the field for the HCV infection. For example, the use of nanosomes (lipidic nanoparticles) achieves the encapsulation of multiple siRNAs with a 100% delivery yield in a liver tumour xenotransplant mouse model of HCV [119] . Alternatively, multilayered polyelectrolyte films have been also shown to be an efficient way of nucleic acid intracellular delivery, providing dose-dependent, specific and long-term inhibition of HCV replication in hepatocyte-derived cells [120] .\n",
            " -Aptamers:\n",
            " Aptamers are nucleic acids that bind to a specific ligand with high affinity. They are isolated by SELEX, an in vitro selection strategy [121, 122] . This process consists of iterative series of the synthesis, binding, positive selection and amplification of a randomised oligonucleotide pool to yield a population enriched in those molecules that can bind to a desired target molecule (Figure 4(b) ). This strategy has identified RNA and DNA molecules of potential therapeutic use in a great variety of diseases, including many viral infections [123] . In addition, aptamers offer useful information about the 3D architecture of the target molecule. They are therefore a valuable alternative to complementary oligonucleotides (antisense and siRNAs). An aptamer's mode of action is dependent on its folding and mediated by direct loop-loop interactions (Figure 4(b) ), which block the function of the RNA target domain, either by interfering with the recruitment of essential factors or by affecting the folding of the surrounding area and thus impeding RNA-RNA interactions, or both. This may contribute to the diminished chance of appearance of resistant viral mutants.\n",
            " Among the preferred viral targets, the most extensively investigated has been the 5′UTR, including that of the genomic RNA of HIV [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] and HCV [130] [131] [132] [133] . Other functional RNA regions have been used as targets for aptamers, such as the 3′UTR [130] and the CRE region of HCV [134] . These inhibitors have returned promising results both in cell culture and in vitro and have been used to produce antiviral compounds efficient in the nanomolar range [135, 136] . Furthermore, this research has served as a starting point for the development of novel strategies combining two or more inhibitor RNA molecules [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] .\n",
            " The emergence of SELEX methodologies has provided novel therapeutic and diagnostic agents with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and low immunogenicity. These compounds are already being investigated by several companies for possible clinical use (reviewed in [143] ). The conjugation of the 5′ end of the aptamer sequence with stabilising agents such as polyethylene glycol has been shown to be very effective in pharmacological formulations [144] . The additional incorporation of ligands for specific cell surface receptors helps in the efficient and precise delivery of agents to target cell types or tissues. Given the great progress being made in this field, aptamers may be in widespread use as antiviral agents in the future.\n",
            " The use of antibiotics for targeting RNA structural elements was firstly described for the aminoglycoside paromomycin. This compound recognises the aminoacyl A site of the bacterial ribosome by its interaction with an enlarged deep grove defined by two bulging and one unpaired adenine residues [145, 146] . This 3D conformation was shown to be strongly similar to that acquired by the HIV-1 dimerisation initiation site (DIS) kissing-loop complex [147] . Further modelling and crystal structure resolution provided a strong basis for the development of modified, high-affinity antivirals derived from aminoglycosides [148] and a more accurate view of the folding of the HIV DIS region [149] . These results will greatly prompt the design of small, improved ligands able to interfere with the folding of the essential DIS domain.\n",
            " Branched peptides targeting the trans-activation response element of HIV Branched peptides are a common therapeutic tool used in the development of synthetic peptide vaccines and drug delivery vehicles [150] . Their usefulness as efficient ligands of RNA molecules is associated with the so-called multivalent targets, that is, FRDs with multiple interacting sites. Additionally, amino acids may carry a radical of specific molecular architecture that increases the target selectivity. These molecules have been isolated from random peptide libraries to generate efficient, non-toxic and cell-permeable antiviral compounds that target the HIV trans-activation response element [151] .\n",
            " The benzimidazole nucleus is the main constituent of many therapeutic drugs, all of them based on the combination of heterocyclic compounds to yield isosters of naturally occurring nucleotides. The chemical composition of these isosters makes benzimidazole derivatives excellent candidates for interaction with natural biopolymers. One of these derivatives, ISIS-11, has attracted much attention in recent years as a potential anti-HCV molecule. This compound specifically interacts with the basal portion of the IRES domain II, the so-called domain IIa [152, 153] . During the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal particle, domain II adopts an L shape that directs the apical hairpin loop IIb towards the 40S subunit E site, thus inducing a conformational shift that promotes the positioning of the start codon close to the active site. In the presence of ISIS-11, domain IIa acquires the shape of an open helix that alters the proper folding of domain II, thus impeding the correct positioning of the viral RNA in the catalytic binding cleft. These findings confirm the important principle of interfering with RNA folding to achieve an inhibitory effect.\n",
            " The compactness of RNA viral genomes provides important advantages in terms of propagation efficiency. Such compactness, however, requires the intervention of a supracoding system (i.e. information in the genome beyond that of the nucleotide sequence) to direct the folding required; without such a supracoding system, no such compactness would exist, and essential functions of the genome in transcription, replication and encapsidation associated with this folding would be lost. Structurally conserved functional RNA elements interact with protein factors and other RNA domains to direct and regulate these functions as well as switch between different steps of the viral cycle. Interfering with the functioning of these structural domains offers a potential means of treating viral infections. The great advances made in the field of chemical synthesis and nucleic acid production have prompted novel initiatives involving small molecules that can alter the 3D conformation of viral genomic RNA domains. This might be used to complement classical antiviral therapies, such as the use of neutralising antibodies or interferon treatment. The combination of clinical strategies is currently under extensive investigation with the aim of improving therapeutic responses and longterm outcomes while minimising toxicity and secondary effects. \n",

            "Title: Survival of Enveloped and Non-Enveloped Viruses on Inanimate Surfaces\n",
            "Body Text: Non-enveloped viruses, such as coxsackieviruses, rotavirus, or poliovirus, can survive for extended periods on surfaces (9, 10) , while enveloped viruses, including H1N1 and human coronaviruses, remain infectious on surfaces after several days (6) . The persistence of dried viruses is affected by various environmental conditions and factors such as heat, moisture, pH, and the type of surface (12, 15) . Furthermore, the compositions of media may also influence the persistence of viruses. The impact of drying on viral persistence has been evaluated in previous studies using viruses typically prepared in standardized media, including a cell culture medium supplemented or not with fetal calf serum (FCS) (4, 19) . However, these media are not representative of clinical situations because viruses have been detected in protein-rich media, such as serum, and protein-poor media, including water (11, 17) .\n",
            " In the present study, the persistence of two enveloped viruses, influenza virus type A (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and two non-enveloped viruses, minute mouse virus (MVM) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), was investigated. These viruses are relevant models for assessing viral persistence. MVM is a member of the Parvoviridae family, which is known to be resistant to desiccation (9) , and the other viruses have been implicated in nosocomial infections (5) . Furthermore, infectious titers higher than 10 6 TCID 50 mL −1 can be obtained for each virus in vitro.\n",
            " In addition, components of virus-containing media may affect viral persistence. Therefore, the influence of concentrations of common media components (fetal bovine serum [FCS] , bovine serum albumin [BSA] and sodium chloride [NaCl]) on the persistence of CVB4 was also investigated.\n",
            " CVB4 E2 is a strain provided by Ji-Won Yoon (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) (8, 13) . HSV-1 (ATCC VR-260), CVB4, MVM (ATCC VR-1346), and H1N1 A/PR/8/34 (ATCC VR-1469) were propagated on Vero (ATCC CCL-81) cells, Hep-2 (ATCC CCL-23) cells, A9 (EACC N° 85011426) cells, and MDCK (NBL2) (ATCC CCL-34) cells, respectively. Infected A9 cells cultured in supplemented DMEM and supplemented MEM (Invitrogen, France) were used to culture Vero and Hep-2 cells. MEM and DMEM media were supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% L-glutamine at 37°C and incubated in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Infected MDCK cells were cultured in MEM at 35°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. When cell lysis reached at least 75%, the inoculated flasks were scratched, freeze-thawed three times, and centrifuged at 2,000×g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was aseptically aliquoted and stored in a −80°C freezer. The viral titer was determined by limiting a dilution assay to 50% of the tissue culture infection dose by the method of Spearman-Kärber method and expressed as log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (7) .\n",
            " CVB4E2-positive strand RNA was quantitated by two-step quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (15) . Briefly, total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, California). Total RNA was retro-transcribed to cDNA using the Affinityscript QPCR cDNA synthesis kit and a specific reverse primer at 42°C for 15 min. Positive strand-specific RT was quantitated by the brilliant II QPCR kit (Agilent Technologies Stratagene) under universal cycle conditions (10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 60°C) on a Mx3000p (Stratagene). Primers were located within the enterovirus 5'-nontranslated region, which was highly conserved among enterovirus serotypes: CVB4 forward (5'-CCCTGAAT GGGGCTAATC) and CVB4 reverse (5'-ATTGTCACCATA AGCAGCCA). The sequence of the CVB4 probe was 5'-VIC-AACCGACTACTTTGGGTGTCCGTGTTT-TAMRA (Applied Biosystems). Negative controls were performed by RT-PCR without the reverse transcriptase enzyme or without DNA. Primers and probe pairs were designed with PrimerExpress software, and data were analyzed with Sequence Detector version 1.6.3 (both from Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts). Results were expressed as the cycle threshold (Ct)\n",
            " Fifty microliters (10 µL for iterative drying) of the virus inocula were applied to the middle of each petri dish lid (35-mm diameter [Falcon]), and dried under the air flow of a class II biological safety cabinet at room temperature. The air flow speed was 0.4 m s −1 and the relative humidity was measured using a relative humidity meter (Temperature and Humidity Data logger, IHM). Medium (1 mL) was added to recover dried virus inocula. The infectious titers of harvested fluids were then determined and the results expressed as described above.\n",
            " Statistical analyses of the results were performed by the Mann-Whitney U test using Graphpad Prism version 5.00 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, USA) when appropriate. Differences were considered to be significant when P <0.05.\n",
            " Fifty microliters of clarified culture supernatant fluids from cells infected with CVB4, MVM, H1N1, or HSV-1 were applied to petri dish lid surfaces and then dried under the airflow of a class II biological safety cabinet at room temperature (20 ± 2°C). The dried inocula were recovered and titrations were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section.\n",
            " Samples were considered dried when liquid was no longer observed on the lids, which occurred within 2 h. The mean values of the infectious titers of droplets containing HSV-1, H1N1, and CVB4 were reduced by 2.33 log 10 ; 1.1 log 10 ; 1.5 log 10 , respectively, 2 h after the inoculation (Fig. 1 ). Infectious viruses were not detected in dried HSV 1 and H1N1 inocula recovered 3 and 5 d after inoculation. In contrast, the viral titers in dried CVB4 inocula recovered 2 h to 5 d post inoculation were unchanged (4.39 +/− 0.38 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 , n=4). The viral titer of MVM in dried inocula recovered one week post inoculation was unchanged and similar to the titers measured in drops applied to the lids (5.87 +/− 0.20 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 n=4). No infectious particle was detected in dried CVB4 inocula 6 weeks after inoculation, whereas a significant amount of infectious particles was recovered from dried MVM inocula (0.5 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 [detection limit] vs 4.00 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 , respectively, P <0.02).\n",
            " Reductions in the infectious titers in recovered inocula when drops were dried on petri dish lids raised several issues. The efficiency of recovering viral particles in these conditions was questioned. The infectious titer of CVB4 was determined to address this issue, and RNA was also extracted to measure the amount of viral RNA by RT real-time PCR in order to estimate the level of viral particles. The amounts of viral RNA in recovered inocula dried for 2 h at room temperature and in fresh inocula were similar, as displayed by the pattern of Ct values obtained by RT real-time PCR (mean values were 24.36 vs. 23.86, respectively, P=0.56), whereas the infectious titer values were markedly different (2.17 log 10 reduction P=0.028) (Fig. 2) . Taken together, these results demonstrated that viral particles dried on petri dish lids were readily recovered.\n",
            " Thus, after drying on a plastic surface, the non-enveloped viruses, CVB4 and MVM, remained infectious for a longer period of time than the enveloped viruses, H1N1 and HSV-1.\n",
            " The patterns of resistance of MVM, CVB4, H1N1, and HSV-1 were examined. Ten microliters of each clarified supernatant fluid containing MVM, CVB4, H1N1, and HSV-1 was dried as described above. Repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension were carried out: 10 µL of sterile distilled water was added to a dried spot to start a new cycle of drying. Thereafter, dried inocula were recovered using 1 mL of culture medium and the viral titers were determined. Fifty microliters of each culture supernatant fluid containing H1N1, CVB4, HSV-1, or MVM was applied to Petri dish lids in quadruplicate. They were dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet at room temperature from 2 h to 6 weeks. Thereafter, dried inocula were recovered using 1 mL of titer media and the infectious titers were determined and expressed as log 10 . The results are the mean ± SD of four independent experiments. The dashed line represents the detection limit of the test. Each drying cycle resulted in a gradual reduction in the viral titers of H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 of approximately −0.4, −1.1, and −1.8 log 10 TCID 50 10 µL −1 per cycle, respectively (Fig. 3) . No reduction in the viral titer was detected for MVM after each cycle of drying. Furthermore, a reduction in viral titers was not observed in clarified supernatant fluids containing viruses kept at room temperature for the duration of the experiment (data not shown).\n",
            " These results showed that iterative drying resulted in reductions in the viral titers of H1N1, CVB4, and HSV-1, whereas those of MVM remained unchanged.\n",
            " Media containing various concentrations of FCS, BSA, and NaCl diluted in distilled sterile water were spiked with 1% of clarified CVB4-containing supernatants. Fifty microliters of these viral suspensions were applied to petri dish lids and dried, and viral titers in the recovered dried spots 2 h after the inoculation were determined.\n",
            " When the CVB4 suspension was spiked in medium containing a low concentration of FCS (<0.05%) or BSA (<0.01 mg mL −1 ) (Fig. 4) , the viral titers in the recovered dried spots were higher at 2.66 and 3.08 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 , respectively. In contrast, the viral titers in the suspension containing 1.25% of FCS and more than 0.39 mg mL −1 of BSA were below the detection limit of the test <0.5 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 . The viral titers in the suspension containing more than 1.25% FCS increased steadily and reached 1.17 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 at 100% FCS (P=0.019 vs the detection limit of the test).\n",
            " The viral titers in the recovered dried spots were lower when CVB4 was spiked in FCS and BSA media than in media containing any concentration of NaCl (Fig. 4) . In media Fig. 3 .

            " containing low concentrations of NaCl from 0 to 0.1 mg mL −1 the viral titers in the recovered dried spots increased slightly from 2.66 to 3.08 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (P=0.1). In contrast, the viral titers in media containing between 0.1 and 2 mg mL −1 NaCl decreased from 3.08 to 2.58 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (P=0.04). In media containing more than 2 mg mL −1 NaCl, the viral titers increased steadily and reached 4.16 log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 at 300 mg mL −1 NaCl (P=0.028 vs. viral titers at 2 mg mL −1 NaCl).\n",
            " The efficiency of recovering CVB4 when drops were dried in protein-rich media was analyzed. Viral titers were determined and RNA was extracted to measure the amount of viral RNA by RT real-time PCR. Experiments were performed with CVB4 spiked (1% vol/vol final dilution) in FBS (100%) or water containing 50 mg mL −1 BSA. In both protein-rich media, the amounts of viral RNA in recovered inocula dried for 2 h at room temperature and in undried inocula were similar, as displayed by the pattern of Ct values obtained by RT real-time PCR, whereas the infectious titer values were markedly different (Fig. 5) . Taken together, these results demonstrated that viral particles contained in a protein-rich medium dried on petri dish lids were readily recovered.\n",
            " Several considerations in the present study are noteworthy. The persistence of H1N1, HSV-1, MVM, and CVB4 was investigated and, for the first time, the effects of NaCl, FCS and BSA concentrations on CVB4 persistence were determined. Moreover, the effects of repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension on the persistence of H1N1, HSV-1, MVM and CVB4 were investigated. We selected petri dish lids for two reasons: they are hydrophobic, which prevents spreading of the droplet, and are non-porous, thereby improving virus viability (2) . The efficiency of viral recovery from petri dish lids was confirmed in experiments combining the measurement of infectious titers and estimation of the levels of viral particles through the amount of viral RNA measured by RT real-time PCR.\n",
            " Inactivation under the biosafety cabinet was achieved at different times based on the type of virus being tested. Inactivation curves for H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 encompassed two phases. The first phase lasted 2 h and corres-ponded to rapid decreases in the viral titer of −2.33, −1.1, and −1.5 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 for HSV-1, H1N1, and CVB4, respectively, but not MVM. In the second phase, the viral titers of each virus slowly decreased. Scheuplein and al. reported that the first phase was characterized by water loss due to the evaporation of free water from the surface (14) , which exposes viruses to a liquid-air interface, leading to virus inactivation (18) . Repeated drying followed by resuspension in water was carried out for the first time in the present study. Infectious titers of H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 decreased gradually at each cycle, whereas no significant change was observed in the MVM infectious titer. Within these cycles, each resuspension modified particle positions and allowed for the new exposure of viral particles to the liquid-air interface, which may explain the continuous reductions observed in viral titers with each cycle (14) . CVB4, which persisted for 5 weeks under the biosafety cabinet, was fully inactivated by 4 cycles of iterative drying, while H1N1 persisted for 5 d and remained infectious after 8 cycles. This difference can be explained by rehydration during the resuspension process, which markedly inactivated non-lipid viruses, as reported previously for poliovirus (3) . However, MVM, a non-enveloped virus, was not affected by iterative drying.\n",
            " Enveloped viruses were more sensitive than non-enveloped viruses in the second phase of viral persistence, which started when liquid was no longer observed on the lids; H1N1 and HSV-1 were inactivated in 5 d and 3 d, whereas CVB4 was inactivated in 6 weeks and MVM continued to be infectious. Drying was slower in this phase, which can be explained by the slow process of water loss due to the diffusion and elimination of bound water, as demonstrated previously (14) . It remains to be determined whether the process is still slower in the case of MVM, as reflected by the persistence of this virus in our experiments.\n",
            " A discrepancy was noted between our results and previous findings and was explained by several differences regarding media, surfaces, virus strains and temperature. Bean et al. inactivated H1N1 at a higher temperature (28.3°C vs. 20°C) (2) and Abad et al. inactivated poliovirus, an enterovirus resuspended in PBS, on a latex surface in less than 20 d (1) whereas CVB4 was inactivated in 6 weeks in our experiments.\n",
            " The results of our study show that the initial concentrations of BSA, FCS, and NaCl played a role in the pattern of viabil- , and 50 µL of these suspensions were applied to petri dish lids in quadruplicate. Inocula on lids were dried for 2 h at room temperature, and, thereafter, recovered with 1 mL of culture media. The infectious titers were determined and expressed as log 10 TCID 50 50 µL −1 (■). RNA was extracted and the levels of viral RNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and expressed as C t (□). The results are the mean + SD of four independent experiments. The dashed line represents the detection limit.\n",
            " ity of CVB4 exposed to drying. The infectious titers of CVB4 after drying were higher when the virus was in pure water than in water containing BSA or FCS. These results demonstrated that the resistance of CVB4 to drying was hampered in the presence of BSA or FCS. The survival curves of CVB4 resuspended in 0 to 0.29 mg mL −1 BSA in 0 and 1.25% FCS were similar, which is consistent with the corresponding concentration of BSA in FCS under these conditions (0 and 0.30 mg mL −1 ). Taken together, these results suggest that the lower resistance of CVB4 in the presence of 0 to 1.25% FCS in our experiments depended on albumin. In contrast, with an initial concentration of more than 1.25% FCS, the impact of drying on CVB4 viability was reduced. A previous study reported that higher concentrations of proteins protected viruses against drying (16) ; however, CVB4 exposed to drying was fully inactivated in the presence of high concentrations of BSA (more than 0.39 mg mL −1 ) in the present study. The mechanism underlying the protective effect provided by high concentrations of FCS against drying remains to be determined. At an initial concentration of more than 10 mg L −1 , NaCl protected CVB4 from desiccation. This can be explained by a slow rehydration process during sample recovery, which protected the viral capsid, as previously suggested (3). In contrast, the viability of CVB4 was the lowest at a concentration of 9 mg mL −1 NaCl, which is the average concentration in blood.\n",
            " We herein showed that viruses persisted for days or even weeks on dry hydrophobic surfaces. The pattern of resistance of viruses toward drying, as illustrated in the model of CVB4, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral populations, as suggested by the results of iterative drying. Moreover, media compositions and component concentrations clearly played a role when virus suspensions were exposed to drying. The results of our study suggest that a subsequent increase in solute concentrations in droplets modulated the viability of viruses toward drying. Since the compositions of media play a role in the viability of viruses exposed to drying, the persistence of viruses in natural media (clinical or environmental), instead of defined media, need to be investigated. Further studies will be directed towards this line of investigation in our laboratory.\n",

            "Title: Synthesis and Translation of Viral mRNA in Reovirus-Infected Cells: Progress and Remaining Questions\n",
            "Body Text: Mammalian orthoreoviruses, hereafter referred to as reovirus, are members of the Reoviridae family, a large family of viruses that have three major characteristics in common. Firstly, their genome is made of a certain number of double-stranded RNA segments. Secondly, they all possess a naked capsid made of concentric protein layers. Finally, the genome of these viruses is never completely released but rather transcribed by viral enzymes retained inside a viral particle in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Mammalian orthoreoviruses have been instrumental in understanding various aspects of Reoviridae replication, although the last decade has seen considerable progress in the understanding of other family members. Some of this work, especially on rotaviruses and orbiviruses, will occasionally be referred to when equivalent data are not available for reovirus.\n",
            " Despite recent accumulating evidence of transmission to humans or domestic animals of new pathogenic strains [1] [2] [3] , reovirus is generally believed to be almost not pathogenic in humans. Nevertheless, they have been extensively used as a model system by prominent figures of late 20th century virology as Bernard Fields, William Joklik and Aaron Shatkin to name just a few. In the last two decades, these viruses have again attracted the attention of the scientific community since they are among the few naturally oncolytic viruses currently under clinical trials [4, 5] and they have been recognized as orphan drugs by the American Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency to treat some forms of cancers (e.g., gastric, pancreatic, peritoneal, ovarian). More recently, they have been used once again as a model system to support the idea that\n",
            " The viral genome consists of ten double-stranded RNA segments or genes named as small (S1 to S4), medium (M1 to M3) or large (L1 to L3) [7] . Each viral gene in mammalian orthoreoviruses harbors identical GCUA sequence at the 5 -end and UCAUC at the 3 -end; other related viruses such as pteropine reovirus also harbor conserved sequences that may however differ. The viral genome and resulting mRNA is not polyadenylated but the plus strand of the viral genome, and at least part of the viral mRNA, harbors a cap structure; this will be further discussed below. The viral capsid is made of 8 proteins while 4 nonstructural proteins are made during the viral replication cycle. The capsid proteins are assembled as an outer capsid and an inner capsid or core; turrets present at the 12 vertices of the capsid structure are made of a single viral protein assembled as homopentamers and serve as anchors for the viral cell-attachment homotrimeric protein [8] .\n",
            " An overall review of the early events, leading to the release of the core structure in the cytoplasm, was published in the last few years [9] and additional information could be found in the recent book chapter of Field's Virology [7] ; a schematic overview of the viral replication cycle is also presented on Figure 1 .\n",
            " Briefly, following host-cell binding to different cellular receptors (e.g., sialic acids, GM2 ganglioside, JAM-I, Ngo-R, B-integrins), the reovirus virions are internalized by clathrin, or possibly caveolin-based, endocytosis. Following endocytosis, stepwise proteolytic digestion of the outer capsid leads to acquisition of a membrane-penetrating ability to cross the late endosomal membrane. Alternatively, partially uncoated particles, known as infectious subviral particles (ISVPs), can bypass endocytosis and gain access to the cell's interior directly through the plasma membrane. The remaining outer capsid proteins will be eliminated either during or after translocation to the host-cell cytoplasm, to generate the transcriptionally active core structure. The uncoating efficiency by the combined effect of lysosomal enzymes and autocleavage by the outer viral capsid µ1 will thus contribute to the efficiency of transcription initiation. In addition, a cellular chaperone is apparently involved in the later steps of uncoating [10] . Cleavage products of the remaining outer capsid proteins are finally released, and the viral cell attachment protein (σ1) is removed from the λ2 pentameric channel, opening it for viral mRNA extrusion while transcription occurs. The presence of the σ3 and µ1 heterohexamer forming the outer capsid is sufficient to inhibit the transcription of full-length mRNA molecules [11] . However, a recent report also suggests that the amount of σ1 protein, or efficiency of its release from the virion, could be a limiting factor to viral mRNA export from the transcriptionally active particle [12] . Interestingly, various reports indicate that different viral isolates can harbor different amounts of σ1 spikes [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , while an earlier report even suggested that as few as three copies of the trimers are sufficient for normal infectivity on fibroblasts in tissue culture [17] . There is thus probably a balance between the amount of σ1 required for optimal infectivity and that required for its most efficient removal allowing synthesis and release of viral mRNA. (1), the reovirus virion containing the double-stranded RNA genome (in blue) is internalized by endocytosis (2) and transported towards late endosomes (2); they are then partially disassembled to produce transcriptionally active cores that are released in the host-cell cytoplasm (3) . Alternatively, due to the action of extracellular proteases, partially uncoated virions known as infectious subviral particles (ISVPs) are generated (1b) and can bypass endocytosis and penetrate the host-cell membrane (2b) also leading to transcriptionally active cores in the cytoplasm (3). These \"parental\" cores possess all required enzymatic activities to synthesize and release multiple copies of capped messenger RNA (in black) synthesized from the ten viral double-stranded RNA genome segments as a template. Released mRNAs are translated by the cellular machinery (4) to generate both structural and nonstructural proteins; alternatively, some copies (4b) will be recruited to viral inclusions (in green) made by viral proteins. One copy of each 10 viral mRNAs will be packaged by viral inner capsid proteins to form intermediate structures (5) where synthesis of the second strand will take place to generate newly formed double-stranded RNA genomes retained in \"progeny\" particles (6) . These, more abundant particles, in turn, are believed to be responsible for the synthesis of the bulk part of viral mRNA responsible for viral proteins synthesis (as indicated by the dotted arrow). Outer capsid proteins will be added (7) to finalize viral particles assembly before release of fully assembled virions (8).\n",
            " Over the past 25 years, the use of site-directed mutagenesis approaches, combined with the development of more efficient nucleic acid sequencing techniques, has contributed to the understanding of viral proteins functions. Essentially, these studies relied on different approaches of in vitro characterization using proteins recovered from various expression systems. Cryo-electron microscopy combined with the structural analysis of proteins by X-ray crystallography has also increased our knowledge of viral particles structure [18] ). But it is only as recently as 2007, that a T7 plasmid-based reverse genetics technique finally allowed to alter with relative ease the genome of reovirus and thus study the effect of predetermined changes on the viral multiplication cycle [19] [20] [21] . More recently, high-throughput approaches have also been used to extensively look at the effect of reovirus infection on either the cellular proteome [22] [23] [24] [25] or transcriptome using microarrays [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] or more extensive RNA-seq approaches [32, 33] . Altogether, these approaches are likely to shed new light on the complex interactions between the host cell and the virus, as discussed below.\n",
            " The inner capsid with its turrets of λ2 pentamers forms the core, active at the transcriptional level and capable of producing viral messenger RNA with a methylated cap-1 structure. Viral mRNA is then released from the cores through the turrets, giving rise to impressive images in electron microscopy [34] . The λ3 protein had already been identified as the viral polymerase in the 1980s, using gene reassortment to identify the gene responsible for the pH optimum of transcription [35] . Biochemical and ultrastructural studies have confirmed beyond doubt that this protein is responsible for the transcription of the viral dsRNA genome [36] [37] [38] . Detailed discussion of the structure of the RNA polymerase can be found in an excellent book chapter [39] and is clearly outside the scope of the present review. However, it should be mentioned that the protein harbors a consensus GDD motif and general thumb, palm, and priming loop structures common to many viral RNA polymerases, as also recently reviewed [40, 41] . The reovirus polymerase does not need a primer per se to initiate de novo RNA synthesis but conserved sequences present at the end of the viral genome are likely required for recognition prior to initiation of polymerization; the second conserved nucleotide on the template strand is especially important to recruit the polymerase allowing initiation of mRNA synthesis from the priming nucleotide. Approximately 12 copies of λ3 per virion are present under the inner capsid close to the base of each turret. Ultrastructural evidence indicates that the newly synthesized mRNAs cross the outer capsid protein layer through a channel at the interface of two λ1 subunits, then through the channel in the middle of the λ2 pentamer [38] . The minus strand of the double-stranded RNA enters the λ3 polymerase through a first channel in the enzyme structure and exit through a second channel; the mRNA synthesized and the nucleotides enter through two other channels in the enzyme structure. The 5 -cap structure on the plus strand of the double-stranded RNA is tethered to λ3 and this is believed to be important for the initiation of the transcription. As for most viruses, the nucleic acid concentration inside the viral particle is high, most recent estimates suggest the concentration to be as high as 400 mg/mL [42] . In Reoviridae, however, the viral genome remains in the viral particle's interior where high viscosity conditions are present thus likely limiting movement of transcriptional complex but still allowing RNA movement [43] . The currently accepted model is sometimes referred to as a \"fixed-polymerase-moving-template\" situation. In different dsRNA viruses, there is evidence that the RNA is well ordered inside the capsid and it is likely that each genomic segment is associated with a single transcription complex [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] and currently available data indicate that it is also likely to be the case in reovirus [36] . Interestingly, in the non-turreted rotavirus, transcription of each gene was recently shown to be specifically associated with one transcription complex and release of each corresponding transcript was shown to occur through one given channel of the transcribing particle [49] ; hopefully, similar experiments will be performed for other members of the Reoviridae, such as mammalian reovirus, in the near future.\n",
            " As was previously discussed [50] , transcription of the reovirus genome to single-stranded mRNA is well known to be conservative. The positive and negative strands forming the genomic double-stranded RNA are kept intact in the capsid and only the newly synthesized plus-strand mRNA progeny is extruded from the core to the cytoplasm. Ample evidence suggests that relatively long sequences are required for adequate function of the viral genomic segments and/or mRNA [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] ; some of these, however, are rather required for packaging or synthesis of the negative strand of the RNA genome, these aspects will not be further discussed herein.\n",
            " The reovirus genome is among the biggest RNA genome at approximately 24 kbp; only coronaviruses have a lengthier (although single-stranded) RNA genome. RNA polymerases do not possess proofreading ability hence the high mutation rate of RNA viruses that may limit their size to allow maintenance of viable genomes through time. Interestingly, coronaviruses were recently shown to possess such an activity; although the required exonuclease activity is encoded by a protein distinct from the polymerase itself [56] . There is no evidence that reovirus possesses such a proofreading ability although this could certainly deserve further study. The replication strategy where the genome is repeatedly used to generate the first strand of new genomes, avoiding a classical semi-conservative strategy, is also a factor that should significantly reduce accumulation of replication errors. To our knowledge there has been no precise measurement of mutation rates in reoviruses, although in the dsRNA phage phi6 (φ6), frequency of nucleotide substitution appears lower than in other RNA viruses [57] . However the φ6 replication Viruses 2018, 10, 671 5 of 25 strategy is slightly different by release of the plus strand of the viral genome rather than its de novo synthesis [58] ; its genome is also much smaller, making comparisons difficult.\n",
            " The necessity of a viral helicase to unwind the dsRNA genome during the transcription of the reovirus genome remains controversial. It has been proposed that the cap-binding site on the λ3 polymerase itself is sufficient to ensure strand dissociation [37] but it does not seem that direct experimental evidence is available to support this view. Interestingly, crystal structure of rotavirus polymerase does also show a cap-binding site [59] while the bluetongue virus polymerase does show a cap dependency [60] , at least for copying of a single-stranded RNA template in vitro. This suggests that these polymerases all use a cap structure to ensure template binding and/or unwinding. Although the reovirus polymerase was shown to possess a polymerizing activity by itself in vitro, it appears to be limited and unable to actually transcribe dsRNA [61] . It is unclear if this is solely due to inappropriate experimental conditions or to the actual necessity of other viral proteins for a full ability to transcribe the viral genome. Two viral core proteins, µ2 and λ1, harbor consensus motifs consistent with a helicase activity, as well as expected affinity for nucleic acids.\n",
            " Several arguments support the idea that the µ2 protein present in approximately 24 copies at the base of the turrets, acts as a co-factor for the polymerase and thus possibly as a helicase. Temperature optimum of transcription, sensitivity to a guanine nucleotide synthesis inhibitor, and optimal temperature of core-associated ATPase activity were all assigned to the µ2-encoding M1 gene [62] [63] [64] . However, indirect effects cannot be excluded, especially since a role of µ2 optimal assembly of viral genome and particles was observed [65] [66] [67] .\n",
            " The λ1 protein also exhibits similar motifs and biochemical properties, acting as an ATPase/helicase in vitro [68, 69] . As µ2, it is part of the core but, unlike µ2, it is also a major structural component of it. The position of the catalytic sequences in the N-terminal region intracapsidic portion of the protein, a region that is dispensable for core assembly [70] is, however, consistent with a possible role as a helicase. The structure of this part of the protein appears to be disorganized and possibly cleaved during the capsid reorganization that leads to transcriptional activation of the core particle [36, 43, 71] ; this was interpreted as either precluding or suggesting its role in transcription. For now, no published study has clearly established or ruled out the importance of the catalytic region of λ1 for the synthesis of viral RNA in the context of a viral infection. Recent data showing that λ1 can contribute to the control of interferon induction [72] suggest additional role(s) for the well-known affinity of the protein for nucleic acid [73, 74] and/or for its enzymatic activity.\n",
            " Results obtained in the 1980s and previously reviewed [50] indicated that the transcriptional frequency of the different genes is indirectly proportional to their length when performing in vitro transcription reaction using purified cores. This is consistent with the idea that each dsRNA segment in the viral capsid is transcribed by a given molecule of RNA polymerase acting at the same speed on the template, as previously mentioned for the recent work on rotavirus [49] . Other earlier reports indicating that the ratio of the ten reovirus mRNAs in the infected cells differs from those obtained in vitro are difficult to reconcile with such a model and the mechanism involved, if any, remains unclear. It will be of interest to clarify this point using modern approaches for precise RNA quantitation, such as quantitative RT-PCR or RNA-seq analysis. Another aspect that remains unexplained is the previously discussed observations [50] showing that only four viral genes are transcribed at very early times post-infection, and that protein synthesis is required to relieve this apparent blockage of transcription on the six remaining genes. In the absence of additional data, it is difficult to assess if this transcriptional regulation actually takes place considering the technical challenges of the hybridization methods used to measure the different viral transcripts at the time.\n",
            " The 5 -end of the viral mRNA harbors a cap structure that is synthesized by sequential enzymatic steps that are essentially identical to those of cellular mRNA cap synthesis, although catalyzed by viral core-associated enzymes, as summarized on Figure 2 , below. The nature of the viral protein responsible for the first step of cap synthesis, namely the RNA triphosphatase (or phosphohydrolase) removing the first phosphate at the 5 -triphosphate end of the newly synthesized RNA, also remains controversial. Again, both µ2 and λ1 exhibit such an activity in vitro [75, 76] with very similar enzymatic parameters. In both cases, the affinity for the substrate as measured by the Michaelis-Menten kinetics was shown to be 10-fold better for 5 -triphosphorylated RNA than for free nucleotides. It thus remains possible that one or the other of the two proteins first acts as an NTPase/helicase but is then preferentially active on the nascent RNA substrate.\n",
            " Amino acids residues essential for the µ2 catalytic activity are necessary for virus recovery in a complementation assay where expression of the wild-type protein encoded by the infecting virus is inhibited by siRNA [77, 78] ; however, the exact step of the viral replication cycle that is affected remains unclear. Furthermore, to our knowledge, similar experiments have not been performed yet with λ1. At this point, there is thus no direct evidence to clearly assign the RNA triphosphatase activity to either of these proteins. Recent structural data on cypoviruses and aquareoviruses, other turreted dsRNA viruses of the Reoviridae family, indicated that the analog of µ2 is positioned inside the core at the basis of the turret and in interaction with the viral polymerase. However, its position precludes an interaction with the 5 -end of the nascent viral mRNA and this appears to rule out the possibility that it acts as the RNA triphosphatase [48, 79] . To our knowledge, similar data are not yet available for reovirus. In contrast, the guanylyltransferase forming the 5'-5 triphosphate link between the first nucleotide and a GDP molecule from GTP, in the second step of cap synthesis, has been known for more than 25 years. The core-associated λ2 turret protein possesses this activity by itself [80] [81] [82] . Following the formation of this link, the so-called cap 0 structure is formed by the addition of a methyl at position N-7 of the transferred GMP. Addition of a 2'-O on the first nucleotide of the mRNA itself then forms the cap 1 structure. Both methyltransferase activities are also clearly associated with λ2 and correspond to the regions around amino acids 420-720 and 800-1030 approximately; however, there is still a controversy concerning the role of each region in forming the cap 0 and cap 1 structure by adding the corresponding methyl group. The position of the two methyltransferase domains has led to suggest that separate In contrast, the guanylyltransferase forming the 5 -5 triphosphate link between the first nucleotide and a GDP molecule from GTP, in the second step of cap synthesis, has been known for more than 25 years. The core-associated λ2 turret protein possesses this activity by itself [80] [81] [82] . Following the formation of this link, the so-called cap 0 structure is formed by the addition of a methyl at position N-7 of the transferred GMP. Addition of a 2 -O on the first nucleotide of the mRNA itself then forms the cap 1 structure. Both methyltransferase activities are also clearly associated with λ2 and correspond to the regions around amino acids 420-720 and 800-1030 approximately; however, there is still a controversy concerning the role of each region in forming the cap 0 and cap 1 structure by adding the corresponding methyl group. The position of the two methyltransferase domains has led to suggest that separate molecules of the λ2 turrets are involved in the consecutive addition of the two methyl groups [36] . This idea is consistent with the guanylyltransferase activity observed with purified λ2 while methyltransferase is not [81] , suggesting that formation of a higher-order complex is necessary for this latter activity. It was also postulated that the order of the three domains on the protein reflects the order of the reactions, the last methyltransferase domain being responsible for the 2 -O methylation forming cap 1 structure [36] . However, detailed sequence homology and structure analysis have rather led other investigators to propose that the order is in fact the opposite, the most amino-terminal domain being rather responsible for the 2 -O methylation [83] . Interestingly, recent crystallographic data of a cypovirus, another member of the Reoviridae harboring a turret similar to that of reovirus, revealed a similar organization where the 2 -O methyltransferase is believed to be located after the N7-methyltransferase on the linear structure of the protein [84] . These data are in agreement with a model where the RNA travels to be in contact with a least two, and possibly three, molecules of the capping enzyme [38] . Our recent work [85] , showing that an amino acid substitution in the first methyltransferase domain leads to increased interferon sensitivity of the virus supports this idea. Increased induction and/or sensitivity to interferon have previously been assigned to an impaired 2 -O methylation for different viruses [86] [87] [88] . Engineering of mutant viruses harboring amino acids substitutions in either methyltransferase domain could help to clarify which domain is actually responsible for each step of methyl addition to the cap structure.\n",
            " In infected cells, in contrast to the situation observed for mRNA transcribed from purified cores in vitro, it has been reported that a certain proportion of the mRNA molecules harbors a cap 2 structure, with the second nucleotide of the mRNA also methylated. This has been reviewed in the past but evidence remains limited [89, 90] . If a proportion of reovirus mRNA is actually harboring a cap 2 structure, a cellular activity must be involved in the addition of this third methyl group. The recent discoveries of cytoplasmic capping activities, and especially the cytoplasmic presence of the cellular methyltransferase involved in cap 2 formation [91] [92] [93] [94] , does support this possibility. Interestingly, it has been observed that the presence of interferon could preclude the synthesis of this cap 2 structure although, this does not seem to have been further established since these early reports [95, 96] . An effect of interferon on relative amount of methyl donor to methyl acceptor molecules (S-adenosylhomocysteine to S-adenosylmethionine) has also been reported [97] . Clearly, it will be of interest to re-examine the effect of interferon on cellular and viral mRNA capping and on the presence or intracellular distribution of the cellular enzymes involved.\n",
            " The work carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart Millward at McGill University in the 1980s suggested that a transition in the nature of the viral mRNA 5 -terminal end occurs during infection. Messenger RNA transcribed by parental virus particles are capped while in progeny particles the enzymatic activities responsible for cap synthesis appear to be either absent, inactive or masked [98] [99] [100] . There have been reports of a transient lack of the λ2 turrets on the progeny particles, as previously discussed [50, 89, 90] . Although later observations failed to support this presence of particles devoid of λ2 in a wild-type virus, they nevertheless indicated that viral cores can be assembled without the turret in a thermosensitive mutant [101] . Also, the initial suggestion that capping enzymes were masked by the presence of nonstructural inclusion protein µNS on the particles [89] was not supported by further studies showing that this does not actually interfere with the capping activities [102] . The mechanism behind the apparent \"masking\" of capping activity thus remains elusive; the development of new powerful ultrastructural imaging techniques could allow to clarify the exact structure of the viral particles at different times during the multiplication cycle, in order to answer this question. It should also be mentioned that the RNA synthesized from viral particles in vitro, harbors a diphosphate end, when produced under conditions favoring RNA production without the cap structure. This is achieved in absence of the methyl donor (SAM) and in the presence of the methyl acceptor (SAH) to prevent the methylation of the cap structure. The reversal of the guanylylation reaction of these unmethylated cap structure is also favored by adding an excess of the reaction product (sodium pyrophosphate) to the reaction. In contrast, the late viral RNA extracted from infected cells exhibits a monophosphate 5 -end, suggesting action of a phosphatase, viral or cellular, a point that has never been further examined. We still do not know the nature of the factor(s) involved, if any. Avoiding the presence of a diphosphorylated 5 -end is a strategy used by other viruses to prevent activation of antiviral program of the innate immune response in infected cells, through recognition by RIG-I or by IFIT1 (Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I or Interferon Induced Protein with Tetratricopeptide Repeats 1) [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] . The importance of the innate immune response in the control of protein synthesis will be further discussed in Section 7.4. Strikingly, a study published in 2013 [108] suggests the presence of a proportion of uncapped rotavirus mRNA late in infection that is recognized by the innate immune system. This again suggests that capping of rotavirus or reovirus mRNAs is probably incomplete, at best, and this could play an important role in the ability of the innate immune system to recognize and control the infection.\n",
            " Earlier work has suggested that reovirus infection could inhibit the transcription of cellular mRNAs [109] but, to our knowledge, this aspect was not further investigated. Its significance remains difficult to assess since decreased transcription was observed concomitantly with decreased protein synthesis and only for serotype 2. The fact that reovirus is a cytoplasmic RNA virus harboring all its transcriptional/capping machinery could lead to the impression that it should not affect nuclear processes. However, there is accumulating evidence of cytoplasmic RNA viruses that either take advantage of, or affect nuclear processes [110] [111] [112] [113] . For example, in rotavirus, sequestration of the poly(A) binding protein to the nucleus is believed to contribute to decreased levels of cellular mRNA available for translation in the cytoplasm [114, 115] but, to our knowledge, this has never been examined for reovirus.\n",
            " At least three reovirus proteins (σ3, σ1s and µ2) have been previously observed, at least in part, in the nucleus of either transfected or infected cells [78, [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] . Although the σ proteins are probably small enough to be partly located to the nucleus by diffusion, other reovirus proteins will require a nuclear localization signal. Interestingly, µ2 and λ3 are predicted to harbor such a signal. Our recent work, using mass spectrometry, allowed to confirm a strong nuclear enrichment of µ2, and a significant enrichment of the viral RNA polymerase λ3 [32] . The role of nuclear λ3, if its nuclear presence is confirmed, remains undetermined but, interestingly, it was recently observed by us and others that reovirus infection significantly affect the pattern of alternative splicing of a certain number of cellular pre-mRNA [32, 33] . Although µ2 appears to be at least partly involved [33] , a possible involvement of λ3 will be somewhat reminiscent of the poliovirus polymerase that was also found in the nucleus and shown to alter the splicing machinery of the infected cells [121] . A better understanding of alternative splicing in reovirus biology appears as a whole new research avenue to be explored.\n",
            " Although the presence of other nuclear viral proteins could not be excluded in this mass spectrometry assay, the absence of σ3 could possibly result from artefactual nuclear localization in previous studies that used overexpression in transfected cells. This should be further investigated at different times post-infection to rule out transient nuclear presence at earlier times post-infection. It should be mentioned that previous results have shown that the presence of µ1, not surprisingly, interferes with σ3 nuclear presence [116, 117] and the balance between free σ3 and µ1 at different times post-infection could thus alter the ratio between cytoplasmic and nuclear σ3, if any, and may have its importance on synthesis or maturation of cellular mRNA.\n",
            " In addition to mRNA synthesis and splicing, recent data also indicate that certain virus strains affect the stability of certain cellular mRNA [122] , the exact significance of this observation and the Viruses 2018, 10, 671 9 of 25 viral protein involved remains to be established but appears to be somehow linked to the capacity of the viral strain to inhibit synthesis of host-cell proteins.\n",
            " The 5 -untranslated region (or non-coding region, NCR) of all ten species of reovirus mRNA is relatively short, as indicated in Figure 3 , below. Some of them are even under the 20-nucleotide length considered as minimal for efficient translational initiation at the 5-proximal initiation codon (AUG) following ribosomal scanning [123] ; however, the so-called TISU consensus sequence (Translation Initiator of Short 5 -UTR) [124] is not present on reovirus mRNA. In the absence of other evidence, it should be assumed that initiation of translation on reovirus mRNA follows the classical ribosomal scanning mechanism, initiating at the first AUG codon. Although it has been suggested that the μ2 protein is rather synthesized from the second AUG codon on the messenger RNA [125] , this was thereafter clearly ruled out [126, 127] . In mammalian orthoreoviruses, each viral gene also encodes only one primary translation product except for S1 and M3. The s1 mRNA encodes both σ1 and a second small nonstructural protein (σ1s) in a second reading frame bypassing the first initiation codon (Figure 3 ), as well established by numerous studies [128] [129] [130] . Interestingly, this was among the first mRNA known to be translated on an alternative open reading frame in eukaryotic cells. This strategy is now known to be relatively frequent on viral mRNA, and recently shown to be potentially more frequent than expected on cellular mRNAs [131] . The m3 mRNA encodes both μNS and a second In the absence of other evidence, it should be assumed that initiation of translation on reovirus mRNA follows the classical ribosomal scanning mechanism, initiating at the first AUG codon. Although it has been suggested that the µ2 protein is rather synthesized from the second AUG codon on the messenger RNA [125] , this was thereafter clearly ruled out [126, 127] . In mammalian orthoreoviruses, each viral gene also encodes only one primary translation product except for S1 and M3. The s1 mRNA encodes both σ1 and a second small nonstructural protein (σ1s) in a second reading frame bypassing the first initiation codon (Figure 3 ), as well established by numerous studies [128] [129] [130] . Interestingly, this was among the first mRNA known to be translated on an alternative open reading frame in eukaryotic cells. This strategy is now known to be relatively frequent on viral mRNA, and recently shown to be potentially more frequent than expected on cellular mRNAs [131] . The m3 mRNA encodes both µNS and a second shorter form (µNSC) by initiating translation at a second in-frame initiation codon [132, 133] (Figure 3 ). To date, there is no evidence that alternative open reading frames are used on other mammalian reovirus mRNAs; only one downstream open reading frames beginning with AUG can potentially encode a peptide longer than 100 amino acids and the surrounding context does not correspond to a favored Kozak's consensus sequence, making it unlikely that it is actually used. However, it is not possible to completely exclude that other mechanisms could allow alternative initiation. In fact, other orthoreoviruses, such as avian or reptilian reoviruses, were shown to encode up to three different polypeptides on the same mRNA while the alternative translational initiation mechanisms used remain incompletely understood [134, 135] .\n",
            " In contrast to the differences in transcriptional efficiency, it appears that the idea that the different viral mRNAs vary in their translational efficiency is well established [50] . Although other factors may well contribute, an extensive folding of the 5 -untranslated region could decrease the efficiency of translation (such as in the s1 mRNA) while shorter, less structured, 5 -end results in increased translation (such as in s4 mRNA), at least in vitro [136] Most eukaryotic mRNAs also possess a 3 -end poly(A) tract that is involved in both stability of the mRNA and its translation through recognition by the poly(A)-binding protein in the so-called closed-loop model of translational initiation [137] [138] [139] . In contrast, as previously mentioned, reovirus mRNAs, as all mRNA of viruses from the Reoviridae family, are not polyadenylated at their 3 -end. In vitro translation studies have established that reovirus mRNA translation is not sensitive to inhibition by free poly(A) nor stimulated by addition a poly(A) tract at their 3 -end [140] . This indicates that they are not dependent on poly(A) binding protein. In rotavirus, despite some controversies, most recent evidence support the idea that a nonstructural viral protein somehow substitute for cellular poly(A)-binding proteins [141, 142] . There is no evidence to date of a similar function among reovirus proteins.\n",
            " As mentioned earlier, viral mRNAs quantitatively responsible for the synthesis of the bulk part of the viral proteins are likely devoid of both the 3 -poly (A) tail and the 5 -cap structure, important structures for both stability and translation of eukaryotic mRNAs. More than 30 years ago, the reovirus protein σ3 was shown to stimulate translation of viral mRNAs, but only those devoid of a cap structure. This protein behaves more or less like a translation initiation factor and was found associated with ribosomes [140, 143] . Additional work indicated that the protein is released by high-salt treatment known to release initiation factors, but not by treatment that will separate the two ribosomal subunits (EDTA) or remove the mRNA template from the ribosomes (micrococcal nuclease) [144] . Furthermore, using in vitro translation system, there were indications that the protein is released from the ribosomes under conditions in which initiation of translation is blocked, while it accumulates on the ribosome when initiation is allowed but elongation is prevented [144] . Similar reports of viral proteins apparently acting as initiation factors of protein synthesis have been reported in the last ten years for RNA and DNA viruses belonging to diverse virus families [137, 145, 146] , including bluetongue virus as another Reoviridae [147] . Interestingly, a recent study revealed that the translation of uncapped infectious bursal disease virus RNA, another dsRNA virus of the Birnaviridae family, relies on the presence of a viral protein that may act as a substitute for the translation initiation factor eIF4E [148] . This suggests that the use of a viral protein to stimulate viral uncapped mRNA translation could be a mechanism shared by different dsRNA viruses.\n",
            " The association of σ3 with ribosomes may also explain the reported presence of σ3 in the nucleus [116, 117] , since preliminary observations suggest a possible nucleolar localization when wild-type σ3 was expressed by itself (unpublished observations). The ability of the protein to bind dsRNA does appear as a prerequisite for this nuclear presence [116] . However, despite the presence of a putative nucleolar localization signal, this should be viewed with caution in the absence of more direct evidence in infected cells. Overall, this should be further examined in the context of viral infection, at different times post-infection, as the importance of the nucleolus in the multiplication of various viruses has now been established [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] . The relative importance of σ3 in stimulating translation of uncapped viral mRNA and/or inhibiting the translation of cellular mRNAs remains unclear, as will be discussed in the next section.\n",
            " It was also recently reported that another viral protein, the σ1s protein, contributes to efficient synthesis of viral proteins, at least in some cell types [154] . The mechanism involved is unknown although σ1s apparently also contributes to the control of the antiviral activity of interferon [155] . The importance of interferon in the control of protein synthesis is further discussed in Section 7.4.\n",
            " Another recent groundbreaking observation also suggests that, contrary to what was generally assumed, the translational machinery is present and active in viral inclusions [156] , as previously observed in large cytoplasmic DNA viruses that also possess a complete transcriptional machinery [157, 158] . This could allow to secure translation of viral proteins at the site of viral mRNA synthesis and viral assembly, and could contribute to shielding viral nucleic acids from recognition by the innate immune system. Surprisingly, other studies do not indicate the presence of ribosomes in the inclusions [159] . Overall, it appears that clarification of the involvement of the viral inclusion during reovirus mRNA translation will require further investigation.\n",
            " Upon infection of the classically used L929 mouse fibroblasts in culture, a significant decrease is observed in synthesis of cellular protein, this inhibition being variable among viral strains [109, 160] . There has been a controversy in the literature concerning the possibility that reovirus mRNA and cellular mRNA are in competition for a limiting factor in the infected cells. This was postulated to be cause for inhibition of host-cell mRNA translation, due to excess viral mRNA [161, 162] . This hypothesis has been previously discussed in greater details [50] and various arguments against this possibility have been presented over the years [163] [164] [165] . In contrast, a series of experiments suggested that late reovirus-infected cells present a decreased ability to support cap-dependent translation of either cellular or viral mRNA [100, 163, 166, 167] . The exact alterations of cap-binding proteins in reovirus-infected cells remain to be more firmly established. It was observed that the addition of a monoclonal antibody directed against the 24 kDa eIF4E cap-binding protein has no effect on translation in cell-free extract prepared from infected cells, in contrast to the inhibition of cap-dependent translation in uninfected cells [168] . This supports the idea of an altered function of cap-binding proteins upon reovirus infection. A decreased amount of crosslinking to radiolabeled cap structure was also observed for a certain number of proteins in infected cells [167] ; however, it does not seem that the phosphorylation of eIF4E is altered, in contrast to the situation observed in inhibition of cap-dependent translation in cells infected with members of the Picornaviridae [169] . Clearly, this should be further investigated now that specific reagents and approaches such as specific antibodies for immunoblotting, RNA interference, gene knockout and mass spectrometry are available to examine more closely each component of the translational machinery. Also, there is clearly a functional difference between uncapped-diphosphorylated reovirus RNA (ppG-terminated) synthesized in vitro and in vivo-synthesized monophosphorylated RNA (pG-terminated). While translation of ppG-terminated RNA is resistant to addition of a cap analog translational inhibitor ( m7 GTP), as expected, pG-terminated RNA was surprisingly found to remain sensitive even in infected cell lysates [163] . This further stresses that earlier competition experiments using in vitro-synthesized RNA should be viewed with caution. It will be interesting to revisit this issue by taking advantage of various chemical inhibitors now available.\n",
            " One might thus think that a transition from cap-dependent to cap-independent (and virus specific?) does actually occur during the viral multiplication cycle of various dsRNA viruses. This transition could contribute to the release of viral capped mRNA from the ribosomes so that it can be used exclusively for the synthesis of double-stranded genome since it is well known that the first strand (by definition positive strand) of encapsidated viral double-stranded genomic RNA harbors a cap structure, as discussed in Section 5.1.\n",
            " Gene reassortment analysis has suggested that the σ3 viral protein is involved in inhibition of host-cell protein synthesis; variation in the extent of this inhibition among viral strains apparently correlates with different subcellular distribution of σ3 [109, 160, 170] . The hypothesis is that the long-known ability of the protein to bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) could inhibit the cellular dsRNA-dependent antiviral protein kinase, PKR. The protein kinase PKR is a cellular, interferon-inducible, antiviral protein that requires dsRNA for its dimerization; the protein can then autophosphorylate becoming activated to phosphorylate different substrates, including translational initiation factor eif2α resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis [171] [172] [173] . The importance of PKR in the control of viral infection is supported by the fact that numerous viruses have developed one, or even many, factors to counteract its activity [146, 171, 174, 175] . Not surprisingly, PKR is inhibited in vitro or in transfected cells in the presence of σ3, due to competition for dsRNA binding [170, [176] [177] [178] . Reovirus σ3 can also substitute for known viral inhibitors of PKR to allow replication of such viruses as adenovirus, vaccinia virus and paramyxovirus [179] [180] [181] [182] . Despite these different observations it remains controversial if PKR is involved, or solely responsible, for inhibition of host-cell protein synthesis during reovirus infection [27, 165, [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] .\n",
            " It has been proposed that upon infection with those viral strains exhibiting a less extensive colocalization of µ1 and σ3, synthesis of cellular proteins is spared [160, 170] . This suggests that free σ3 is responsible, for the control of protein synthesis during infection. However, it should be emphasized that these different studies were performed in only one cell type and comparing different viruses that were not fully characterized. The use of isogenic strains harboring well-defined genetic alterations, as now possible through the use of reverse genetics, could better allow to understand the role of σ3.\n",
            " Numerous arguments indicate that binding of σ3 to µ1 and dsRNA are mutually exclusive although binding sites may not directly overlap [188] . Interestingly, a σ3 thermosensitive mutant is unable to interact with µ1 at the restrictive temperature and, as a result, exhibits an increased ability to bind dsRNA and decreased susceptibility to interferon [117] . Much work has been devoted to the biochemical mapping of amino-acid motifs involved in dsRNA binding of σ3 and two different models, not necessarily mutually exclusive, have emerged [189, 190] . In a first one, two basic motifs are found and are both involved although the second one, with a critical lysine, is most important [177, 178, 191, 192] . In a later model, the RNA is proposed to be bound at the basic surface of a σ3 homodimer [193, 194] . Recent data have actually confirmed the transition from σ3 homomultimer to structural σ3-µ1 heterohexamer by the action of cellular chaperonin [195] .\n",
            " When σ3 mutants are individually expressed in transfected cells, a correlation appears between their ability to bind dsRNA, their nuclear localization, and their ability to stimulate protein translation, most likely through PKR inhibition [117, 170, 177, 178, [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] .\n",
            " Altogether, a possible model thus emerges in which the σ3 protein is synthesized in excess compared to its µ1 partner and can thus exist in one of two forms: (i) as a dimer to exert a regulatory role in the control of translation regulation and (ii) as part of the heterohexamer complex with µ1 to form the bulk part of the outer capsid. The balance between these two functions will likely have an impact on viral multiplication and effect on its host cell.\n",
            " A detailed discussion of the interferon response and its effect on viral replication goes beyond the scope of the present review. However, since it is becoming more and more evident that the activation of the interferon response consecutive to viral infection is of importance in the regulation of protein synthesis [196] , it seems appropriate to briefly reflects on these aspects in the context of reovirus infection.\n",
            " Recognition of viral signature following viral infection is followed by induction of interferon and interferon-stimulated genes. This could be followed by activation of the cellular protein kinase, PKR, consecutive to its homodimerization due to presence of viral double-stranded RNA, and inhibition of protein synthesis that could interfere with viral replication. In the case of reovirus, it does not seem that the genomic double-stranded RNA is exposed to the recognition by the innate immune system. The exact structure that is recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) remains to be firmly established in the context of a viral infection. It has been clearly shown that diphosphorylated 5 -end present on the minus strand of the viral dsRNA genome is a potent PAMP recognized by RIG-I [197] ; however, it is unclear if these will be actually exposed during the viral multiplication cycle. Obviously, if part of the mRNA molecules is devoid of a cap structure, this could also be recognized as non-self-RNA and induces interferon signaling. Extensive folding of some viral mRNA species could also be recognized. Finally, if some viral strains or viral mutants lack the ability to correctly methylate the viral cap structure, to make viral RNA as similar as possible to cellular mRNAs, this could lead to either induction or sensitivity to the antiviral response, as proposed for an interferon-sensitive reovirus mutant [85] .\n",
            " In NIH-3T3 cells, inhibition of PKR promotes viral replication, this observation has been at the origin of the idea of using reovirus as an oncolytic virus, since oncogenic Ras could also lead to inhibition of PKR [184] . Further work then indicated that oncogenic Ras can also inhibit interferon induction through negative regulation of RIG-I signaling involved in activation of the interferon response in the presence of viral RNA [198] . The presence of an activated Ras should thus promote replication, propagation and cell-killing activity of the virus in transformed cells. Accordingly, increased sensitivity to interferon of a mutant virus was shown to correlate with increased ability to discriminate between parental and Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells [199] . Since interferon response or signaling is known to be often deficient in cancer cells [200, 201] , a better understanding of reovirus determinants of induction of the interferon response or viral sensitivity to the induced response could clearly be of importance for a possible optimization of reovirus as an oncolytic virus [202, 203] .\n",
            " In apparent contradiction, other data indicate that in the absence of PKR in murine embryonic fibroblasts, reovirus replication is actually reduced; this suggests that a certain level of cellular stress is required for efficient virus replication, at least in some cell types and with some viral strains [27] . This could be reconciled if one considers the multiple roles that PKR plays in the cell, normal or infected [171, 173] . Although it is not possible to discuss this point in detail herein, an interesting observation is the fact that PKR can contribute to activation of the p38 pathway. Stimulation of the same pathway was previously shown to be involved in the stimulation of reovirus replication following Ras transformation [204, 205] . Partial schematic representations of these pathways are presented on Figure 4 .\n",
            " Depending on prior status of the cell, a certain level of PKR activation could thus be beneficial to reovirus through activation of stress pathways leading to p38 activation. This could well vary between viral strains, depending on their sensitivity to the antiviral effect of PKR through eIF2α phosphorylation that may counteract this positive effect. These aspects in relation to the oncolytic activity of reovirus were most thoroughly discussed in a recent review in this journal [206] .\n",
            " Other evidence indicates the activation of PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation during viral infection, even though viral messenger RNA continue to be actively translated [185, 186, 207] , as are some cellular, eIF2-independent, mRNA such as ATF4. Some of these data may seem contradictory and could be explained again by differences between viral strains, some of them probably having the ability to inhibit the antiviral activity of PKR at a level consistent with viral replication.\n",

Stimulation of the same pathway was previously shown to be involved in the stimulation of reovirus replication following Ras transformation [204, 205] . Partial schematic representations of these pathways are presented on figure 4. More recently, further progress has been made in understanding the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells since the discovery of so-called \"RNA granules\" such as stress granules or processing bodies. These granules appear to be principally used by the cell to limit the use of the energy-expensive translational machinery by transiently sequestering RNA to be later translated or degraded. Accordingly, infection by a variety of viruses stimulates or inhibits the formation of these granules and in either case the result could promote or interfere with viral replication [208] [209] [210] . It has been shown that stress granules are actually formed during reovirus infection [27, 211] ; to our knowledge there has been no report of processing bodies formation, although this may just have been overlooked in reovirus studies. Later studies suggested that stress granules are formed at an early stage and probably dissociated to allow protein synthesis during the later stages of the infection [185, 207] . Interestingly, some viral core and inclusion proteins were found in the stress granules [212] while some stress granules proteins could be trapped later in the inclusions [213] . Overall, this is consistent with a model in which viral mRNA is transiently stored in stress granules until inclusions are formed. This could contribute to avoid recognition by the host cell defense mechanisms, or allow compartmentalization of the synthesis of viral proteins late in infection, if it actually occurs in viral inclusions.\n",
            " Despite the progress in our understanding of the reovirus multiplication cycle in the last 30 years, many questions remain on such basic aspects as how the viral genome is transcribed and how it is translated efficiently. Also, and even more strikingly, the effects of the virus on the cellular transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational machinery remain either controversial or poorly known. Some of the most striking questions are summarized in Table 1 , below. •Is there a temporal regulation in the transcription of viral genes upon infection? •Is there involvement of helicase activity of µ2 or λ1 in transcription?\n",
            " •Are each segment of genomic RNA transcribed by a single transcription complex?\n",
            " Cap structure of reovirus mRNA •Is µ2 or λ1 acting as the RNA triphosphatase for viral mRNA cap synthesis? •Is cap2 structure present on viral mRNA and what is its role? •Is the capping activity absent, inactive or hidden in progeny cores?\n",
            " •Is transcription of cellular mRNA affected by reovirus infection?\n",
            " •What is the exact role of modified alternative splicing during reovirus infection?\n",
            " •Is a viral protein acting as a surrogate of poly(A)-binding protein?\n",
            " •Is a translational operator present on viral mRNA? •Is protein synthesis modified to favor translation of uncapped viral mRNA?\n",
            " •What is the exact involvement of σ3 in the regulation of protein synthesis?\n",
            " •What is the mechanism allowing σ1s to stimulate synthesis of viral proteins?\n",
            " •Is PKR involved in inhibition of cellular protein synthesis?\n",
            " •What is the exact role of stress granules formation during reovirus infection? Such aspects could well become critical in our understanding of viral pathogenesis in potentially emerging reoviruses, as well as in our use of the virus as an oncolytic agent. The breakthrough of plasmid-based reverse genetics, as well as the development of new approaches based on transcriptomics, proteomics and gene-editing technologies, will likely accelerate our progress in the next decade. Hopefully, new investigators will likely pursue the work of the previous generations of virologists.\n",

            "Abstract: Increasing antiviral drug resistance is a major concern for treating influenza, especially in a pandemic setting when the availability of a protective vaccine is uncertain. Resistance is often an issue with drugs directed at viral proteins and for small RNA viruses there are also a limited number of viral proteins that are amenable to inhibition by a small molecule. A new approach that is gaining support is that cellular proteins, which facilitate virus replication, may be used as alternative targets. Whereas drugs directed at viral proteins tend to be virus-specific, drugs directed at host targets have the potential to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity as many viruses may share a dependency on that host function. For influenza virus, we have very limited knowledge of which cellular factors are involved in virus replication, let alone which of these have suitable properties to serve as drug targets. Through the use of high-throughput RNA interference screens, several studies have addressed this gap in our knowledge. The resulting datasets provide new insight into host pathways that are involved in the influenza virus replication cycle and identify specific host factors in these pathways that may serve as potential targets for future antiviral drug development.\n",

            "Abstract: Social network analysis provides innovative techniques to analyze interactions among entities by emphasizing social relationships. Diffusion in the social network can be referred to spread of information among interconnected nodes or entities in a network. The rate and intensity of diffusion depend upon network topology and initialization of network parameters. Individual nodes act as source of motivation for others in the diffusion process. The epidemic model is one of the basic diffusion models that helps in analyzing the transmission of infectious disease from one person to another through social connections. This can be further generalized for other socially connected platforms involving information exchange. In our research, we have proposed a diffusion methodology for tracking the rate with which information spread over underlying social interaction structure, with variation in time and other social parameters. In addition to forward state transitions, recoverable transition is also proposed, which allows a node currently under influence of incoming information, to revert back to previous state of perception. The proposed model also assists in predicting the fraction of population getting diffused over real and large-scale complex network for specific temporal domain.\n",

            "Abstract: Background: Many low-and middle-income countries have implemented control measures against coronavirus disease 2019 . However, it is not clear to what extent these measures explain the low numbers of recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths in Africa. One of the main aims of control measures is to reduce respiratory pathogen transmission through direct contact with others. In this study, we collect contact data from residents of informal settlements around Nairobi, Kenya, to assess if control measures have changed contact patterns, and estimate the impact of changes on the basic reproduction number (R 0 ). Methods: We conducted a social contact survey with 213 residents of five informal settlements around Nairobi in early May 2020, 4 weeks after the Kenyan government introduced enhanced physical distancing measures and a curfew between 7 pm and 5 am. Respondents were asked to report all direct physical and non-physical contacts made the previous day, alongside a questionnaire asking about the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and control measures. We examined contact patterns by demographic factors, including socioeconomic status. We described the impact of COVID-19 and control measures on income and food security. We compared contact patterns during control measures to patterns from non-pandemic periods to estimate the change in R 0 . Results: We estimate that control measures reduced physical contacts by 62% and non-physical contacts by either 63% or 67%, depending on the pre-COVID-19 comparison matrix used. Masks were worn by at least one person in 92% of contacts. Respondents in the poorest socioeconomic quintile reported 1.5 times more contacts than those in the richest. Eighty-six percent of respondents reported a total or partial loss of income due to COVID-19, and 74% reported eating less or skipping meals due to having too little money for food.\n",

            "Abstract: Viruses may be regarded as dynamic nucleoprotein assemblies capable of assisted multiplication within cells, and of propagation between cells and organisms. Infectious virus particles (virions) assembled in a host cell are dynamic, generally metastable particles: They are robust enough to protect the viral genome outside the cell, but are also poised to undergo structural changes and execute mechanochemical actions required for infection of other cells. This chapter provides an introduction to the structural and physical biology of viruses by including: (i) an elementary overview on virions and the structural basis of virus function; (ii) a concise summary on basic techniques used in structural or physical virology; (iii) brief structure-based general descriptions of the different stages in the virus cycle, especially those in which virions and/or their components are involved. These contents may facilitate a better understanding of the specialized subjects treated in the rest of the book. This chapter is also intended as a \"road map\" to help interconnect and integrate in a single picture the different topics described in depth in the 21 monographic chapters in this book.\n",

            "Abstract: Carbohydrate binding agents (CBAs), including natural lectins, are more and more considered as broad-spectrum antivirals. These molecules are able to directly inhibit many viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Dengue Virus, Ebola Virus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus through binding to envelope protein N-glycans. In the case of HIV, it has been shown that CBAs select for mutant viruses with N-glycosylation site deletions which are more sensitive to neutralizing antibodies. In this study we aimed at evaluating the HCV resistance to CBAs in vitro. HCV was cultivated in the presence of increasing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Cyanovirin-N, Concanavalin-A or Griffithsin concentrations, during more than eight weeks. At the end of lectin exposure, the genome of the isolated strains was sequenced and several potential resistance mutations in the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins were identified. The effect of these mutations on viral fitness as well as on sensitivity to inhibition by lectins, soluble CD81 or the 3/11 neutralizing antibody was assessed. Surprisingly, none of these mutations, alone or in combination, conferred resistance to CBAs. In contrast, we observed that some mutants were more sensitive to 3/11 or CD81-LEL inhibition. Additionally, several mutations were identified in the Core and the non-structural proteins. Thus, our results suggest that in contrast to HIV, HCV resistance to CBAs is not directly conferred by mutations in the envelope protein genes but could occur through an indirect mechanism involving mutations in other viral proteins. Further investigations are needed to completely elucidate the underlying mechanisms.\n",

Knowledge of the pathogen involved also allow implementation of infection control and monitoring of success of antiviral treatments that may affect the prognosis of patients. Epidemiological data collected through accurate diagnostics play an important role in public health through identification and control of outbreaks, implementation of appropriate diagnostic tests, vaccination programs and treatment but also to recognize common and emerging pathogens in a community. It is key that the clinician have an understanding of appropriate specimens to send to the laboratory and the value of specific nucleic acid and serological testing for different viral pathogens. Molecular techniques have revolutionized viral diagnoses over the past decade and enhanced both the sensitivity and specificity of tests and the speed by which a diagnosis can be made and new tests be developed. The continued use of serology for viruses with a short viremia, or for chronic infections should however complement these tests. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the available tests, the principles of testing and appropriate tests to select for different viruses and syndromes. Also provided is a glimpse of new developments in diagnostics that may further enhance the capacity to make a conclusive diagnosis in the near future.\n",

            "Abstract: Background: The aerosol box and intubation tent are improvised barrier-enclosure devices developed during the novel coronavirus pandemic to protect health care workers from aerosol transmission. Objective: Using time to intubation as a crude proxy, we aimed to compare the efficiency and usability of the aerosol box and intubation tent in a simulated manikin. Methods: This was a singlecenter, randomized, crossover manikin study involving 28 participants (9 anesthetists, 16 emergency physicians, and 3 intensivists). Each participant performed rapid sequence intubations in a random sequence of three different scenarios: 1) no device use; 2) aerosol box; 3) intubation tent. We compared the time to intubation between different scenarios. Results: The median total intubation time with no device use, aerosol box, and intubation tent were 23.7 s (interquartile range [IQR] 19.4-28.4 s), 30.9 s (IQR 24.1-52.5 s), and 26.0 s (IQR 22.1-30.8 s) , respectively. Post hoc analysis showed a significantly longer intubation time using the aerosol box compared with no device use ( p < 0.001) and compared with the intubation tent ( p < 0.001). The difference between the intubation tent and no device use was not significant. The first-pass intubation success rate did not differ between the groups. Only aerosol box use had resulted in breaches of personal protective equipment. Participants considered intubation with the intubation tent more favorable than the aerosol box. Conclusions: The intubation tent seems to have a better barrier-enclosure design than the aerosol box, with a reasonable balance between efficiency and usability. Further evaluation of its efficacy in preventing aerosol dispersal and in human studies are warranted prior to recommendation of widespread adoption.\n",

            " Contradictory data are available that nsp2 of highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV activates NF-κB in cells by inducing IκBα degradation and p65 translocation to the nucleus, and thus promotes the expression of IL-6, IL-10, and COX-2. The hypervariable region of nsp2 was essential for NF-κB activation (Fang et al., 2012a) . This finding was supported by Huang et al ) that nsp2 of HP-PRRSV had no inhibitory effect on IFNβ production. The nsp2 function for the innate immune modulation needs to be clarified. nsp4: PRRSV nsp4 is a serine proteinase (SP) and inhibits IFNβ promoter activity (Beura et al., 2010). Nsp4 did not hinder NF-kB phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation but antagonize IFNβ transcription in the nucleus (Chen et al., 2014b). The inhibition depends on the SP activity in nsp4. Studies also show that nsp4 cleaves NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) at a single site (glutamate 349) and thus suppresses NF-κB activation and IFNβ production (Huang et al., 2014). However, a recent study showed that scission of NEMO by nsp4 occurred at two additional sites (glutamates 166 and 171) (Chen et al., 2019). This study further showed the NEMO fragment of residues 1-349 could activate IFN-β transcription more robustly than full-length NEMO, whereas all other NEMO cleavage products were abrogated for the IFN-β-inducing capacity. Thus, NEMO cleavage at E349 alone may not be sufficient to completely inactivate the IFN response via this signaling adaptor. These findings suggest that the multiple-site NEMO-cleavage by nsp4 is critical for disarming the innate immune response for viral survival. Additionally, nsp4 suppresses IFNβ transcription by blocking NF-κB activation (Chen et al., 2014b). PRRSV nsp4 of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f\n",

However, efficient production of Moloney murine leukemia (MLV) infectious viral particles was only achieved with stable expression of a shorter S version in Cterminal (S) in MLV Gag-pol expressing cells. As compared to transient transfections, this platform generated viruses with a 1,000-fold higher titer. S was 15-times more efficiently incorporated into VLPs as compared to S, and that was not due to steric interference between the cytoplasmic tail and the MLV capsid, as similar differences were also observed with extracellular vesicles. The amount of S incorporated into VLPs released from producer cells was high and estimated at 1.25 µg/ml S2 equivalent (S is comprised of S1 and S2). The resulting VLPs could potentially be used alone or as a boost of other immunization strategies for COVID-19.\n",

            "Abstract: The feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) envelope glycoprotein (Env) possesses a short cytoplasmic domain of 53 amino acids containing four highly conserved cysteines at Env positions 804, 811, 815 and 848. Since palmitoylation of transmembrane proteins occurs at or near the membrane anchor, we investigated whether cysteines 804, 811 and 815 are acylated and analyzed the relevance of these residues for Env functions. Replacement of cysteines 804, 811 and 815 individually or in combination by serine residues resulted in Env glycoproteins that were efficiently expressed and processed. However, mutations C804S and C811S reduced Env fusogenicity by 93% and 84%, respectively, compared with wild-type Env. By contrast, mutant C815S exhibited a fusogenic capacity representing 50% of the wild-type value. Remarkably, the double mutation C804S/C811S abrogated both Env fusion activity and Env incorporation into virions. Finally, by means of Click chemistry assays we demonstrated that the four FIV Env cytoplasmic cysteines are palmitoylated.\n",

            "Abstract: In vitro assembly of alphavirus nucleocapsid cores, called core-like particles (CLPs), requires a polyanionic cargo. There are no sequence or structure requirements to encapsidate singlestranded nucleic acid cargo. In this work, we wanted to determine how the length of the cargo impacts the stability and structure of the assembled CLPs. We hypothesized that cargo neutralizes the basic region of the alphavirus capsid protein and if the cargo is long enough, it will also act to scaffold the CP monomers together. Experimentally we found that CLPs encapsidating short 27mer oligonucleotides were less stable than CLPs encapsidating 48mer or 90mer oligonucleotides under different chemical and thermal conditions. Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.\n",

            "Abstract: The Government of India in-network with the state governments has implemented the epidemic curtailment strategies inclusive of case-isolation, quarantine and lockdown in response to ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. In this manuscript, we attempt to estimate the impact of these steps across ten selected Indian states using crowdsourced data. The trajectory of the outbreak was parameterized by the reproduction number (R 0 ), doubling time, and growth rate. These parameters were estimated at two time-periods after the enforcement of the lockdown on 24 th March 2020, i.e. 15 days into lockdown and 30 days into lockdown. The authors used a crowd sourced database which is available in the public domain. After preparing the data for analysis, R 0 was estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) method which is based on the expectation minimum algorithm where the distribution probability of secondary cases is maximized using the serial interval discretization. The doubling time and growth rate were estimated by the natural log transformation of the exponential growth equation. The overall analysis shows decreasing trends in time-varying reproduction numbers (R (t) ) and growth rate (with a few exceptions) and increasing trends in doubling time. The curtailment strategies employed by the Indian government seem to be effective in reducing the transmission parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic. The estimated R (t) are still above the threshold of 1, and the resultant absolute case numbers show an increase with time. Future curtailment and mitigation strategies thus may take into account these findings while formulating further course of action.\n",

We compared burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic strains. We weighted analyses to the age and regional structure of England to give nationally representative estimates. We compared symptom profi les over the fi rst week of illness for diff erent strains of PCR-confi rmed infl uenza and non-infl uenza viruses using ordinal logistic regression with symptom severity grade as the outcome variable. (13-34) , suggesting most infl uenza infections are asymptomatic. 25% (18-35) of all people with serologically confi rmed infections had PCR-confi rmed disease. 17% (10-26) of people with PCR-confi rmed infl uenza had medically attended illness. These fi gures did not diff er signifi cantly when comparing pandemic with seasonal infl uenza.

            "Abstract: The present study investigated patterns of adolescent life changes across multiple life domains and utilized a holistic-interactionistic perspective to examine their individual, familial, and societal correlates with a sample of 2544 Chinese parent-adolescent dyads. Adolescents were aged from 10 to 19 years old (50.16% girls). Latent profile analysis revealed five life change profiles, including three improved profiles at various degrees, one unchanged profile, and one worsened profile. The majority of adolescents had an improved or unchanged life. Multinomial logistic regression analyses found that most of the individual, familial, and societal factors predicted the group memberships. Notably, parent-adolescent conflict was a significant factor that predicted memberships of all patterns. These findings show the resilience of adolescents and indicate the need for policies and interventions that consider the holistic nature of adolescents' person-context system, especially during a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

            "Abstract: Africa has experienced over a decade of sustained economic growth. However, since the outbreak of Ebola, there have been pertinent questions as to whether and what extent such outbreaks have developmental implications in the continent. It is in this context that this article investigates whether and to what extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affects the development of Africa's economies. Using data from various international organizations, we show that the pandemic has indeed slowed down African economies, albeit in differing degrees across various regions of the continent. However, the slowdown is moderate compared with economies in high-income countries and the world economies as a whole. We contend that while it is difficult to predict when the crisis is going to end, the continent can navigate itself out of it by leveraging on the ever-increasing global prices of agricultural products and natural resources.

            "Abstract: Countries around the world have undertaken a wide range of strategies to halt the spread of COVID-19 and control the economic fallout left in its wake. Rural areas of developing countries pose particular difficulties for developing and implementing effective responses owing to underdeveloped health infrastructure, uneven state capacity for infection control, and endemic poverty. This paper makes the case for the critical role of local governance in coordinating pandemic response by examining how state authorities are attempting to bridge the gap between the need for rapid, vigorous response to the pandemic and local realities in three Indian states --Rajasthan, Odisha, and Kerala. Through a combination of interviews with mid and low-level bureaucrats and a review of policy documents, we show how the urgency of COVID-19 response has galvanized new kinds of cross-sectoral and multi-scalar interaction between administrative units involved in coordinating responses, as local governments have assumed central responsibility in the implementation of disease control and social security mechanisms. Evidence from Kerala in particular suggests that the state's long term investment in democratic local government and arrangements for incorporating women within grassroots state functions (through its Kudumbashree program) has built a high degree of public trust and cooperation with state actors, while local authorities embrace an ethic of care in the implementation of state responses. These observations, from the early months of the pandemic in South Asia, can serve as a foundation for future studies of how existing institutional arrangements and their histories pattern the long-term success of disease control and livelihood support as the pandemic proceeds. Governance, we argue, will be as important to understanding the trajectory of COVID-19 impacts and recovery as biology, demography, and economy.\n",

            "Abstract: Detailed information on the source, spread and evolution of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during seasonal community outbreaks remains sparse. Molecular analyses of attachment (G) gene sequences from hospitalized cases suggest that multiple genotypes and variants co-circulate during epidemics and that RSV persistence over successive seasons is characterized by replacement and multiple new introductions of variants. No studies have defined the patterns of introduction, spread and evolution of RSV at the local community and household level. We present a whole genome sequence analysis of 131 RSV group A viruses collected during 6-month household-based RSV infection surveillance in Coastal Kenya, 2010 within an area of 12 km 2 . RSV infections were identified by regular symptom-independent screening of all household members twice weekly. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RSV A viruses in nine households were closely related to genotype GA2 and fell within a single branch of the global phylogeny. Genomic analysis allowed the detection of householdspecific variation in seven households. For comparison, using only G gene analysis, household-specific variation was found only in one of the nine households. Nucleotide changes were observed both intra-host (viruses identified from same individual in follow-up sampling) and inter-host (viruses identified from different household members) and these coupled with sampling dates enabled a partial reconstruction of the within household transmission chains. The genomic evolutionary rate for the household dataset was estimated as 2.307 Â 10 À 3 (95% highest posterior density: 0.935-4.165Â 10 À 3 ) substitutions/site/year. We conclude that (i) at the household level, most RSV infections arise from the introduction of a single virus variant followed by accumulation of household specific variation and (ii) analysis of complete virus genomes is crucial to better understand viral transmission in the community. A key question arising is whether prevention of RSV introduction or spread within the household by vaccinating key transmitting household members would lead to a reduced onward community-wide transmission.\n",

Recent research has continued to shed light on the genetic and immunologic factors that play a role in the pathogenesis of PFAPA. There also exists significant heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and progress has been made to develop evidence-based management strategies and establish a standard of care. This review will outline current knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of PFAPA, as well as treatment strategies and our clinical experience.\n"

            "Abstract: Microbiologic infections acquired from animals, known as zoonoses, pose a risk to public health. An estimated 60% of emerging human pathogens are zoonotic. Of these pathogens, >71% have wildlife origins. These pathogens can switch hosts by acquiring new genetic combinations that have altered pathogenic potential or by changes in behavior or socioeconomic, environmental, or ecologic characteristics of the hosts. We discuss causal factors that infl uence the dynamics associated with emergence or reemergence of zoonoses, particularly in the industrialized world, and highlight selected examples to provide a comprehensive view of their range and diversity.\n",

            "Abstract: Climate change is leading to increases in global temperatures and erratic precipitation patterns, both of which are contributing to the expansion of mosquito-borne arboviruses and the populations of the mosquitos that vector them. Herein, we review recent evidence of emergence and expansion of arboviruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitos that has been driven in part by environmental changes. We present as a case study of recent work from Có rdoba, Argentina, where dengue has been actively emerging in the past decade. We review recent empirical and modeling studies that aim to understand the impact of climate on future expansion of arboviruses, and we highlight gaps in empirical studies linking climate to arbovirus transmission at regional levels.\n",

            "Abstract: Candida species are a major cause of invasive fungal infections. While Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis are the most dominant species causing lifethreatening candidiasis, C. auris recently emerged as a new species causing invasive infections with high rates of clinical treatment failures. To mimic initial phases of systemic Candida infections with dissemination via the bloodstream and to elucidate the pathogenic potential of C. auris, we used an ex vivo whole blood infection model. Similar to other clinically relevant Candida spp., C. auris is efficiently killed in human blood, but showed characteristic patterns of immune cell association, survival rates, and cytokine induction. Dual-species transcriptional profiling of C. aurisinfected blood revealed a unique C. auris gene expression program during infection, while the host response proofed similar and conserved compared to other Candida species. C. auris-specific responses included adaptation and survival strategies, such as counteracting oxidative burst of immune cells, but also expression of potential virulence factors, (drug) transporters, and cell surface-associated genes. Despite comparable pathogenicity to other Candida species in our model, C. auris-specific transcriptional adaptations as well as its increased stress resistance and long-term environmental survival, likely contribute to the high risk of contamination and distribution in a nosocomial setting. Moreover, infections of neutrophils with pre-starved C. auris cells suggest that environmental preconditioning can have modulatory effects on the early host interaction. In summary, we present novel insights into C. auris pathogenicity, revealing adaptations to human blood and environmental niches distinctive from other Candida species.\n",

            "Abstract: Evidence suggests that emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, originate from wildlife species, and that land-use change is an important pathway for pathogen transmission to humans. We first focus on zoonotic disease spillover and the rate at which primary human cases appear, demonstrating that a potential outbreak is directly related to the area of wildlife habitat. We then develop a model of the costs and benefits of land conversion that includes the effect of habitat size on the risk of disease outbreak. Our model and numerical simulations show that incorporating this risk requires more wildlife habitat conservation in the long run, and how much more should be conserved will depend on the initial habitat size. If the area is too small, then no conversion should take place. Any policy to control habitat loss, such as a tax imposed on the rents from converted land, should also vary with habitat area.

Scientific evidences showed that the onset of new viral pathogens with a high epidemicpandemic potential is often the result of complex interactions between animals, humans and environment.\n",
            " In this context, the interest of the scientific community has also been attracted towards the potential interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with environmental compartments. Many issues, ranging from the epidemiology and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water bodies to the potential implications of lockdown measures on environmental quality status are here reviewed, with a special reference to marine ecosystems. Due to current sanitary emergence, the relevance of pilot studies regarding the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spread and the direct and indirect environmental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, that are still a matter of scientific debate, is underlined.\n",

            "Abstract: Community-networks such as families and schools may foster and propagate some types of public health disasters. For such disasters, a communitarianoriented ethical lens offers useful perspectives into the underlying relational nexus that favors the spread of infection. This chapter compares two traditional bioethical lenses-the communitarian and care ethics framework-vis-à-vis their capacities to engage the moral quandaries elicited by pandemic influenza. It argues that these quandaries preclude the analytical lens of ethical prisms that are individual-oriented but warrant a people-oriented approach. Adopting this dual approach offers both a contrastive and a complementary way of rethinking the underlying socioethical tensions elicited by pandemic influenza in particular and other public health disasters generally.\n",

            "Abstract: The extent and duration of immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical outstanding questions about the epidemiology of this novel virus, and studies are needed to evaluate the effects of serostatus on reinfection. Understanding the potential sources of bias and methods to alleviate biases in these studies is important for informing their design and analysis.\n",
            " Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serologic studies in the context of an uncontrolled or a controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytic approaches to analyze the simulated data. We find that in studies assessing whether seropositivity confers protection against future infection, comparing seropositive individuals to seronegative individuals with similar time-dependent patterns of exposure to infection, by stratifying or matching on geographic location and time of enrollment, is essential to prevent bias.\n",

            "Abstract: Diseases are either communicable or non-communicable. Communicable diseases or infectious diseases are caused by interactions between two living organisms whereas non-communicable diseases are either hereditary or due to the living environment of animals. Animals are very susceptible to various types of infections and pathogens may live outside or inside their body very conveniently. Epidemic diseases affect animal herd, livestock and the leading cause of animal mortality which may result in significant losses to the agricultural economy. Animal diseases are a matter of concern due to the direct effect on the economy as well as the possibility of pathogen transmission in humans. The accurate detection of animal diseases is an important factor to control diseases in livestock and in wild animals. Disease diagnosis in animals is very challenging and based on the variety of examinations and tests. In this context, nano-biosensors exhibit better disease detection capacity than conventional methods. Nano-biosensors show high sensitivity, stability, reproducibility with a lower limit of detection. This chapter emphasized the insight of communicable and non-communicable animal diseases and their detection through nano-biosensing devices. Some important animal diseases are discussed along with a description of developed nano-biosensors for them. Nano-biosensor functionalized with disease-related biomarkers performed better than any other conventional methods in various aspects.\n"

            "Abstract: The surface stability and resulting transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, specifically in indoor environments, have been identified as a potential pandemic challenge requiring investigation. This novel virus can be found on various surfaces in contaminated sites such as clinical places, however, the behaviour and molecular interactions of the virus with respect to the surfaces are poorly understood. Regarding this, the virus adsorption onto solid surfaces can play a critical role in transmission and survival in various environments. In this article, firstly an overview of existing knowledge concerning viral spread, molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2, and the virus surface stability is presented. Then, we highlight potential drivers of the SARS-CoV-2 surface adsorption and stability in various environmental conditions. This theoretical analysis shows that different surface and environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, and pH are crucial considerations in building fundamental understanding of the virus transmission and thereby improving safety practices.\n",
            " Coronavirus genomes are comparatively large for RNA viruses and SARS-CoV-2 encodes an extensive complement of non-structural proteins (e.g. 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CL) protease, papainlike protease, etc.) as well as structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein 1 .

The highlighted findings shed lights onto the potential molecular interactions between the virus and the solid surface which lead to further virus adsorption, viability, and transmission processes, and can help community to take necessary measures to tackle associated challenges.\n",

            "Abstract: During viral infection, virus-derived cytosolic nucleic acids are recognized by host intracellular specific sensors. The efficacy of this recognition system is crucial for triggering innate host defenses, which then stimulate more specific adaptive immune responses against the virus. Recent studies show that signal transduction pathways activated by sensing proteins are positively or negatively regulated by many modulators to maintain host immune homeostasis. However, viruses have evolved several strategies to counteract/evade host immune reactions. These systems involve viral proteins that interact with host sensor proteins and prevent them from detecting the viral genome or from initiating immune signaling. In this review, we discuss key regulators of cytosolic sensor proteins and viral proteins based on experimental evidence.\n",

            "Abstract: Viruses replicate and proliferate in host cells while continuously adjusting to and modulating the host environment. They encode a wide spectrum of multifunctional proteins, which interplay with and modify proteins in host cells. Viral genomes were chronologically the first to be sequenced. However, the corresponding viral proteomes, the alterations of host proteomes upon viral infection, and the dynamic nature of proteins, such as post-translational modifications, enzymatic cleavage, and activation or destruction by proteolysis, remain largely unknown. Emerging high-throughput techniques, in particular quantitative or semi-quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of viral and cellular proteomes, have been applied to define viruses and their interactions with their hosts. Here, we review the major areas of viral proteomics, including virion proteomics, structural proteomics, viral protein interactomics, and changes to the host cell proteome upon viral infection.\n",

            "Abstract: Viruses may be regarded as dynamic nucleoprotein assemblies capable of assisted multiplication within cells, and of propagation between cells and organisms. Infectious virus particles (virions) assembled in a host cell are dynamic, generally metastable particles: They are robust enough to protect the viral genome outside the cell, but are also poised to undergo structural changes and execute mechanochemical actions required for infection of other cells. This chapter provides an introduction to the structural and physical biology of viruses by including: (i) an elementary overview on virions and the structural basis of virus function; (ii) a concise summary on basic techniques used in structural or physical virology; (iii) brief structure-based general descriptions of the different stages in the virus cycle, especially those in which virions and/or their components are involved. These contents may facilitate a better understanding of the specialized subjects treated in the rest of the book. This chapter is also intended as a \"road map\" to help interconnect and integrate in a single picture the different topics described in depth in the 21 monographic chapters in this book.\n",

            "Abstract: Human blood plasma has been reported to possess nonspeci®c antiviral activity. This activity is due to several preexisting naturally occurring molecules that are either active against individual members or a family of viruses. These molecules, however, have not been adequately studied to reveal their molecular structures and mechanisms of action presumably because of their low and nonspeci®c antiviral action. Therefore, their possible role against viraemia remains unknown. Recently, two naturally occurring nonspeci®c broad-spectrum antiviral agents, University of Texas Inhibitor b (UTIb) glycoprotein and high density lipoprotein, have been described in human serum. They are active against DNA and RNA viruses and one of them, UTIb, possesses signi®cant antiviral activity of 40 units/mL. Since preexisting antiviral molecules in serum appear to be the only defence mechanisms available at the onset of viral infection they may have protective signi®cance against viraemia. In view of this potential, we have undertaken to review the properties of these innate viral inhibitory molecules.\n",

            "Abstract: In the present study, we evaluated the viability of non-enveloped viruses, minute virus of mice (MVM) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), and enveloped-viruses, influenza A virus (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), on surfaces. We also investigated the impact of the initial concentration of proteins and sodium chloride on the persistence of infectious CVB4 on surfaces. Viral suspensions (>10 4.5 TCID 50 ) were applied to petri dish lids and dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet. The recovered viral preparations were titered on appropriate cell lines. Enveloped viruses persisted for less than 5 days while CVB4 and MVM persisted for weeks. However, repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension had a stronger virucidal effect on CVB4 than on H1N1 and HSV-1. These repetitive cycles had no effect on the infectious titer of MVM. When exposed to drying, the initial concentrations of bovine serum albumin (from 0 to 90 mg mL −1 ), fetal calf serum (from 0 to 100%), and sodium chloride (from 0 to 300 mg mL −1 ) affected the viability of CVB4. CVB4 was more likely to be inactivated by drying in a protein-rich medium, whereas the impact of drying was reduced in the presence of sodium chloride. The results of the present study demonstrated that the resistance of viruses to drying, as suggested by iterative drying, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral subpopulations, but was influenced by media compositions and component concentrations, as illustrated in the model of CVB4.\n",

            "Abstract: Recent advances in 3D printing have led to a rise in the use of 3D printed materials in prosthetics and external medical devices. These devices, while inexpensive, have not been adequately studied for their ability to resist biofouling and biofilm buildup. Bacterial biofilms are a major cause of biofouling in the medical field and, therefore, hospitalacquired, and medical device infections. These surface-attached bacteria are highly recalcitrant to conventional antimicrobial agents and result in chronic infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and medical officials have considered 3D printed medical devices as alternatives to conventional devices, due to manufacturing shortages. This abundant use of 3D printed devices in the medical fields warrants studies to assess the ability of different microorganisms to attach and colonize to such surfaces. In this study, we describe methods to determine bacterial biofouling and biofilm formation on 3D printed materials. We explored the biofilmforming ability of multiple opportunistic pathogens commonly found on the human body including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus to colonize eight commonly used polylactic acid (PLA) polymers. Biofilm quantification, surface topography, digital optical microscopy, and 3D projections were employed to better understand the bacterial attachment to 3D printed surfaces. We found that biofilm formation depends on surface structure, hydrophobicity, and that there was a wide range of antimicrobial properties among the tested polymers. We compared our tested materials with commercially available antimicrobial PLA polymers.\n",

            "Abstract: The ability to shut off host gene expression is a shared feature of many viral infections, and it is thought to promote viral replication by freeing host cell machinery and blocking immune responses. Despite the molecular differences between viruses, an emerging theme in the study of host shutoff is that divergent viruses use similar mechanisms to enact host shutoff. Moreover, even viruses that encode few proteins often have multiple mechanisms to affect host gene expression, and we are only starting to understand how these mechanisms are integrated. In this review we discuss the multiplicity of host shutoff mechanisms used by the orthomyxovirus influenza A virus and members of the alpha-and gamma-herpesvirus subfamilies. We highlight the surprising similarities in their mechanisms of host shutoff and discuss how the different mechanisms they use may play a coordinated role in gene regulation.\n",

            "Abstract: The employment of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for virus detection and quantification offers the advantages of high sensitivity and reproducibility, combined with an extremely broad dynamic range. A number of qualitative and quantitative PCR virus assays have been described, but commercial PCR kits are available for quantitative analysis of a limited number of clinically important viruses only. In addition to permitting the assessment of viral load at a given time point, quantitative PCR tests offer the possibility of determining the dynamics of virus proliferation, monitoring of the response to treatment and, in viruses displaying persistence in defined cell types, distinction between latent and active infection. Moreover, from a technical point of view, the employment of sequential quantitative PCR assays in virus monitoring helps identifying false positive results caused by inadvertent contamination of samples with traces of viral nucleic acids or PCR products. In this review, we provide a survey of the current state-of-the-art in the application of the real-time PCR technology to virus analysis. Advantages and limitations of the RQ-PCR methodology, and quality control issues related to standardization and validation of diagnostic assays are discussed.\n",

Notable members include West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Chikungunya, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus and enteroviruses of the Picornaviridae family.Unfortunately, prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against these pathogens are limited. +RNA viruses have limited coding capacity and thus rely extensively on host factors for successful infection and propagation. A common feature among these viruses is their ability to dramatically modify cellular membranes to serve as platforms for genome replication and assembly of new virions. These viral replication complexes (VRCs) serve two main functions: To increase replication efficiency by concentrating critical factors and to protect the viral genome from host anti-viral systems. This review summarizes current knowledge of critical host factors recruited to or demonstrated to be involved in the biogenesis and stabilization of +RNA virus VRCs.\n"
